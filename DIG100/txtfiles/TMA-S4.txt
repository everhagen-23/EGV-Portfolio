OLIVER
Um. Hello, John. Do you… mind if I call you John? I, I mean, you don’t actually know me. It’s just, well. “Archivist.” It’s so formal, isn’t it? And I do kind of know you…? Haven’t had much choice, really. Dreams are like that, you know. No matter how lucid you think they are, there’s always that part that just drags you along.

Guess I don’t need to tell you that. At least, not right now.

[sigh] Wish I could tell you why I came here. Wish I knew why I came here. Suppose there’s only so long you can dream about someone and not at least try to find them. That was it with the old woman, too. That was different, though. Way I figure it, she stuck her nose in just about everywhere it wasn’t wanted and stirred up hornets, ‘till all the precautions in the world couldn’t stop death from finally catching her. [sigh] If I had known more back then, I’m not sure I’d have bothered trying to warn her. Still, you live and learn, don’t you?

Sorry to go on, I, I don’t talk to many people these days. Putting my thoughts outside myself, it gets a bit, er, clumsy. Be easier if you could talk back, right? Ask me questions, and just, have it tumble all out? But no. It’s, it’s just me. Wish there was a better way, but touching someone’s mind, it’s not as simple as that, is it? Doesn’t always make things clearer, you know? Still, I gave the old woman a statement, so maybe I owe you one as well. That’s how it works, right? Give your terror, give your dream? It’s not like I don’t have them to spare.

Hmm.

Let me tell you about how I tried to escape.

OLIVER (STATEMENT)
So. My name is Oliver Banks. In my other statements, I used the name Antonio Blake, but I don’t really think either name has much meaning for me anymore. It’s been almost ten years since I first started dreaming about the deaths of others. Seeing those awful veins crawling into them, into wounds not yet open, or skulls not yet split. People who are about to die. Every night I watch as they sneak up and into throats about to choke on blood, or lurch into hearts about to convulse. I’ve come to terms with it. [bitter laugh] I’ve learned to live with it.

But about two years before I came to your Institute, something happened. Something I didn’t want to talk about. Didn’t even want to think about. I started to see them when I was awake. It was subtle at first, so quick I could pretend I hadn’t seen. Just a second of them webbed over the face of a drunk old man stumbling into his car. A chain smoker exhales, and just for a second I catch one dangling from his mouth, before it slithers back inside. Crossing a bridge and I might see one snaking along the road, over towards the railing.

Looking back now I feel like an idiot, trying to pretend I was imagining it – that I was just tired, or whatever bull I told myself. It started to happen more often, and I began to avoid the places that I visited in my dreams. I sort of knew, you see, that not all of the cords would have faded when I woke up.

I still remember the first time I tried to touch one. In my dreams the night before, I had found my way back to my own street. I don’t know why I did it; I knew it was a stupid thing to do, walking past my own home in a dream. But I just… maybe I wanted it this way. I mean, when I stepped out the building that morning, I didn’t turn towards the bus stop like I always do. I turned right instead, walked over to the little alleyway where I knew, sometime in the next week, a young woman was going to have a fatal aneurysm. And there they were on the concrete, like a starburst of fleshy roots, spreading and reaching out from the spot where her head was going to hit the ground. They moved just like in the dreams, throbbing and pulsing.

I had to take a moment, just to be sure, just to be completely sure, that I was awake. I felt like I was staring at it for hours, but I don’t think it was much more than a few minutes. They didn’t fade, didn’t vanish, and there was no way for me to pretend that they weren’t there. So, I reached out my hand and tried to touch them.

You know what’s weird, right? In all my years of being a – …what am I? Death prophet? Whatever. – I had never actually touched a corpse. Hardly ever seen one in real life. I could have told you in a moment how many people in this hospital were going to die. How many would do it tonight, even how it was going to happen. But I had never once actually come up close to a dead body. I always assumed they were cold. Not quite damp, but sort of clammy.

Still… this was like ice. No – colder than ice. The sort of cold that just cuts right through you. It was soft and rubbery, squirming when I pressed on it, and recoiling from the tip of my finger. I’ve never felt anything as cold as those veins. It was so… patient. It made me think of those winter mornings, when I was a kid, with no snow, just frost and frozen mist over everything. Keeping the world in place, curling you up into yourself, and quietly waiting for you to lose your footing, to slip up and fall. Snap!

It made me think of dead worlds floating out into space. Places that didn’t know and didn’t care that life even existed. It made me think of mortality, like the seconds that were dragging me to the grave were being pulled out of me.

And the worst part was that, somewhere in me I, I liked it. Underneath all that awful fear, it felt like… home.

After that happened, they wouldn’t leave me alone. I could see them spreading, see them growing. Even when I went to your Institute, tried to warn her, I could see them crawling through the corridors, towards the Archives. They never got quite as big as they were in my dreams, but it wasn’t long before I was seeing them all the time. I tried to avoid them – of course I did – but sometimes I didn’t notice, and I would brush against them. Never mattered what I was wearing, cold would just cut through it like a razor.

I wanted to escape. I needed to. I became obsessed with trying to find somewhere with fewer and fewer people. Moving out of the city helped, but, well. People still die in the countryside. I saw them coiling around a fencepost by the road, climbing up the wall and into the top window of a beautiful little cottage. I’ll never forget seeing a field of cows the week before they were sent to the abattoir.

I’d spend hours researching, desperately looking at remote locations, places far away from civilization, and all its dying people. Lonely summits, deep jungles, deserts where even animals couldn’t live. I was so hungry for the peace that I thought these places could give me.

Then I read about Point Nemo. If you look it up online, they call it the “oceanic point of inaccessibility.” It’s a spot in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. Specifically, it is the farthest it’s possible to be from any landmass. 1400 miles from anyone or anything. No ships ever need to travel through it, and ocean currents keep away the nutrients that would have normally supported sea life. It is the emptiest, most lifeless place on earth.

Sometimes the closest humans are in the satellites orbiting up above it – before they fall out of the sky, of course. It turns out, Point Nemo is an ideal site for spacecraft to crash-land. There must be hundreds of wrecks down there, taken from the edge of one lifeless abyss and sent screaming down into another.

I loved it. The idea of it, of being so far from anything. Somewhere that there was so little life that death could never find me. Empty clear water, free of those creeping tendrils.

Of course, I had no way to get there. I’m not a rich man, and even if I was, it’s not like I have any idea how to organize a sea voyage. So, for years, it was just my little fantasy. My escape. Whenever it all got too much for me, and I woke up to those veins reaching along the wall, towards my neighbor’s apartment, I would go online, and look at the photos people claimed were taken at Point Nemo. I would revel in the thought that those claims were probably lies, as there was a very good chance that no human being had ever reached the exact coordinates that promised me my escape.

But I couldn’t dream of it. I tried, of course. I spent every moment of lucidity I had trying to guide myself far, far away from land; away from those horrid tubes that sat there throbbing doom out into the world. But each time I started to get away from them – whenever I felt I, I might have reached a point where I couldn’t see any more of them – I would start to feel this tugging on my leg. Like something was wrapped around it and starting to gently squeeze. Something that pulsed very softly.

I never quite had the courage to actually look at it. I’d always just turn around and start moving back towards a city. And it would let me go. I never even got over the channel in my dreams, let alone all the way to the South Pacific.

So, you can maybe imagine how I felt when I found an article, tucked in the margins of a regional paper, talking about an upcoming expedition to sail a research vessel down to Point Nemo. The piece didn’t go into much detail about what they were trying to do – something about measuring the amount of plastic and chemicals in the water, seeing how much impact humans had had on the environment at its most extreme point… I mean, I don’t know.

I’m not a scientist. And I’m not a sailor, either. There was no legitimate way I was ever going to make it onto that ship, but none of that mattered. I had to do it. I hadn’t been sleeping much, I suppose, and I had it lodged into my mind that if I could just get there, to Point Nemo, if I could just… if I could be far enough away from mortality and people and land, then I could rest. I could finally have a dreamless sleep.

So, I did some digging, found the identity of a few crew members, and started to track them down. I told myself that I didn’t know what I was looking for, but I did. Of course I did. And I finally saw them, following along behind Dr. Thomas Pritchard.

He was a younger guy, some sort of chemist, and he had a habit of driving his motorcycle a bit too recklessly. When I saw him that first time, the veins were tumbling out from the open visor of his bike helmet and coiling themselves around his throat so tightly that it almost seemed like his head wasn’t attached the rest of him. Of course, after he went flying over the barrier at 95 miles an hour… well, it’s neither here nor there. It was three in the morning, and the motorway was silent, except for me and the mangled remains of Dr. Thomas Pritchard.

I knew exactly what I had to do. He didn’t look anything like me, not really, but that didn’t matter. All that mattered was my desperation to finally have a good night’s sleep. I looked at his body, but all I could think of was the gentle rocking of lifeless waves. So I took his ID and his keys. Then I touched my very first corpse as I loaded what was left of him and his motorcycle into my van, and buried them in a well-hidden spot near Epping Forest.

It’s strange, after all that. I don’t actually remember how I felt. Heavy, I think.

But I had other concerns. It was a daft plan. It shouldn’t have worked. Someone should have driven past while I was moving him. Someone should have seen me. But they didn’t. With his keys, I let myself into Dr. Pritchard’s flat and gathered as much information on the expedition as I could. It wasn’t a lot – not that I could really understand, and I just had to hope it was enough to pass myself off. Even if it was only long enough to get one good night’s sleep.

As it turned out, I needn’t have bothered. Far as I could tell, nobody on board had actually met Dr. Pritchard in person. A couple of people told me they had “the greatest respect for my work,” and a few did say how different I had sounded on the phone. But once I walked up and said who I was, nobody even bothered to check my ID.

I don’t remember the name of the ship. I mean, boarding it was such a blur I didn’t really notice much, and later on I was far too nervous to ask. It was large, though with every spare inch covered in scientific equipment of some sort or other. I was relieved to find out I was the only chemist on board, so nobody was going to see me misusing anything, and figure out what was going on. At least, not until it was too late to act upon it.

There were a couple of marine biologists on board, a meteorologist, an engineer, someone who called herself a “macro-ecologist” – though at times, she looked almost as out of her depth as I did. Beyond that, there were half a dozen crew running the ship.

They were led by Captain MacAvey, a tall, ugly woman with a sharp tongue, though it was never clear to me whether she was the one in charge of the expedition, or if it was Clara, the senior-most marine biologist. It didn’t really matter, of course. As far as I was concerned, Dr. Pritchard was a private, standoffish person who liked to spend his time alone in his makeshift lab, or asleep in his bunk.

And I did sleep. The further we got from land, the deeper, more peaceful it became. I still dreamed, of course, but I would just wander the empty deck of the ship, drinking in the quiet atmosphere of the place.

I did have to force myself not to look over the railing in my dreams. Once or twice, while staring at the peaceful dream water, I almost felt like I could see something moving, deep, deep below the surface, impossibly huge and dark. I quickly learned the lesson to remain fully focused upon the ship when I dreamed.

Of course, the more rest I got, the more lucid I became. I was thinking more clearly than I had in months, and the absolute foolishness of what I’d done to get there was starting to sink in. There was exactly no way that they wouldn’t figure out that I did not have a doctorate in chemistry or, er, suchlike, and when that happened, I had no idea what I was going to do. I spent days trying to think of some sort of plan, but in the end, the best I could come up with was just to wait for it, and throw myself upon their mercy and hope that they took enough pity on me not to immediately pitch me overboard into the waters of the South Pacific.

But, that was the future. Before then, I had months of peaceful sleep ahead of me. Then, I had weeks. Then days. The ship kept going, powering on towards a destination I wasn’t completely sure I still wanted. I started to wander the decks in my waking hours as well as my sleeping, staring at the horizon. It never ended, but kept getting closer, all the same.

Time is like that, isn’t it? Just keeps going, no matter what happens, it just carries on, and it strips everything away from you in the end, the good and the bad alike, until there is nothing left of either.

“This too shall pass.” “All good things must come to an end.” “Memento mori.”

As soon as I woke up, I knew we had finally reached Point Nemo. Everything felt different – like the calm I had been getting accustomed to had been torn away completely, and where it had been was just this horrible, ice-cold terror.

I felt something on my chest, coiling up my back and pulsing gently around my throat. I didn’t need to look down to know what it was. In a second, I was out of my bunk and charging onto the deck, just to see veins, dark and cold and bigger by far than any I’d ever seen, rise up from the water below us. They towered over the ship for just a second, before starting to wrap themselves around it. For a moment, the embrace looked almost… affectionate.

The rest of the crew didn’t seem to notice, walking through the immense, grasping tendrils like they weren’t there at all, even as the small and branching cords stretched off and wrapped around each one of them in turn. And the soft icy flesh that wrapped around me kept gripping me tighter, and tighter, until I could barely move.

I wanted to scream, but the others were already staring at me as if I was screaming obscenities. Perhaps I was.

At that moment, a sudden calm came over me. I understood it all. I could follow the line of the huge veins that encased the ship down into the water, leading off to a point to almost a mile to the southeast.

There. That was it. That was our fate; where we would always be. Because I was going to take us there.

Running was pointless. To try to escape from my task would only serve to fulfill another. I finally understood what I needed to do. I couldn’t steer a ship myself, of course, but there were plenty of other people on board who could, as long as I could persuade them. Which I did, to a point. I don’t know where I got the gun, but once captain MacAvey was dead, the others were very keen to sail wherever I wanted.

The doom held me tight and pulled us all slowly, inevitably towards our grave. And when we got there, and cut the engines, and began to wait, I could feel all of their eyes look to me, panicked, hoping for some sort of explanation.

I almost tried to give them one. But I barely got the first word out before the falling satellite debris hit the ship at 200 miles an hour, killing us instantly.

OLIVER
Right. That’s, uh, it, I suppose. Maybe you heard me. Maybe you’ll dream. Then again, maybe I just wasted my breath – but, I don’t think so.

Honestly, I’m still not exactly sure why I’m here. But you know better than anyone how the spiders can get into your head. Easier to just do what she asks.

The thing is, John, right now you have a choice. You’ve put it off a long time, but it’s trapping you here. You’re not quite human enough to die, but still too human to survive. You’re balanced on an edge where the End can’t touch you, but you can’t escape him.

I made a choice. We all made choices. Now you have to –

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
GEORGIE
Can I help you?

OLIVER
Oh, I, I’m a friend. Of John’s.

GEORGIE
Are you, now.

OLIVER
Uh, y-yes.

GEORGIE
Right. Just haven’t seen you visiting before.

OLIVER
Umm, I’ve… been out of town!

GEORGIE
Right. The nurse didn’t say anyone else was here.

OLIVER
Oh! Oh, oh, well. Sorry if I surprised you.

GEORGIE
It’s fine.

OLIVER
…I’m Antonio!

GEORGIE
[sarcastic] Sure.

OLIVER
Do you um, mind giving us a minute?

GEORGIE
No, I think you’re done here.

OLIVER
Oh. Uh… right…

[SOUND OF STANDING UP]
…have I upset you, miss –

GEORGIE
No, you just remind me of someone.

OLIVER
Ahhh, I’m sorry! Were they –

GEORGIE
Evil. Yes.

OLIVER
[resigned] Uh, okay, then. Well, I just, well, I guess I should just go.

GEORGIE
I guess you should!

OLIVER
…Make your choice, John.

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]
GEORGIE
[sigh] Sorry about that, but you really don’t need friends like tha…

….

Did…?

[PAUSE]
[DOOR OPENS AND GEORGIE RUNS OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR]
Hey! Hey, get back here, I need to talk to you!

[CLOCKS CONTINUES TO TICK]

[CLICK]
[INT. HOSPITAL, JOHN’S ROOM]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The clock of the hospital room ticks on steadily in the background.]
BASIRA
Well?

GEORGIE
It was just there!

BASIRA
Could he have come back? Moved it?

GEORGIE
I guess?

BASIRA
And you’re sure you didn’t recognize him.

GEORGIE
No, no – he was, um – I’d never seen him before.

BASIRA
But?…

GEORGIE
He, uh, he felt like death.

BASIRA
What, capital ‘D’ Death?

GEORGIE
Yeah. Y’know, one of your… dark gods –

BASIRA
(frustrated) They’re not –

[She cuts herself off.]
BASIRA
Look, I’m trying to help. You came to me.

GEORGIE
I came to Melanie.

BASIRA
Well, sorry. Right now, I’m it.

[Silence, but for the clock.]
BASIRA
So John told you, then.

GEORGIE
Some of it. Not – everything.

BASIRA
Right. So how exactly is it that you’re able to identify an avatar of the End on sight?

GEORGIE
Honestly Basira, it’s not your business. (pause) Sorry.

[Basira sniffs.]
BASIRA
Alright. And you don’t know why this guy would have left a tape recorder?

GEORGIE
You’re the detective.

BASIRA
And you’re sure it was him who left it?

GEORGIE
I mean – the nurses said there were no other visitors, so (breath) unless it appeared by magic?

[Pause.]
GEORGIE
(disbelief) What, seriously?

BASIRA
I don’t know. The whole tape thing is… I don’t know.

GEORGIE
Right, well… I showed you like you asked, so –

BASIRA
Shh.

[Rustling as she moves down, getting closer to the tape recorder.]
BASIRA
Down here.

[More rustling.]
GEORGIE
I told you –

BASIRA
This is the one?

[We hear the Archivist breathing hoarsely, quietly in the background.]
GEORGIE
Sure.

BASIRA
You don’t sound very sure.

GEORGIE
I mean – I don’t know. It might be a different model maybe? I thought it was plastic – but yeah.

[More Archivist breathing/sighing as she’s speaking; by the time she’s done the room is silent but for the clock again.]
GEORGIE
So – what does it mean?

ARCHIVIST
(hoarse, tired, drained) That’s a very good question.

GEORGIE
(overlapping) John!

BASIRA
(overlapping) Jesus.

ARCHIVIST
(bit of a dry laugh) Sorry. (breath) Didn’t mean to scare you.

GEORGIE
(overlapping) I’ll get a nurse.

BASIRA
Wait.

GEORGIE
Basira!

BASIRA
John, is it still… you?

ARCHIVIST
Uhh. Y-yes. Y-yes, I-I think so; I, I don’t know how you’d prove it, though.

BASIRA
Hm.

GEORGIE
Enough – just – stay still; I’ll get a nurse.

ARCHIVIST
I, no, I, uh, (he starts to sit himself up) I’m alright, it’s –

GEORGIE
(overlapping) Stop it!

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) – I’m okay.

GEORGIE
John, you are not okay; you have been in a coma.

[Rustling.]
ARCHIVIST
Wait – wait – how long?

BASIRA
Six months, give or take.

ARCHIVIST
Six… Uh, the others. T-Tim. Is he…?

[Silence.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh.

[He lets out a breath.]
BASIRA
Daisy too.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

BASIRA
Yeah.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Alright – g–

[Sounds of exertion- trying to sit up further?]
GEORGIE
John.

ARCHIVIST
It’s alright.

GEORGIE
Stay still. Please.

[The Archivist sighs, then takes a shaky breath.]
GEORGIE
How are you feeling?

ARCHIVIST
Honestly, I – I, I think I’m alright.

[Georgie sighs in exasperation.]
ARCHIVIST
I mean that’s – good, right?

[Georgie sighs again.]
ARCHIVIST
I –

GEORGIE
After a six month coma? No – it’s not. This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, John.

ARCHIVIST
I – what? Y-y-you’d prefer I was – brain-damaged? Dead?

BASIRA
John.

ARCHIVIST
(shaky sigh) W,W,What?

[Pause, Basira sighs.]
BASIRA
Georgie, could you give us a minute? There’s some things we should probably discuss.

GEORGIE
(overlapping) Fine.

ARCHIVIST
D– Georgie, I –

GEORGIE
John. If this really is a second chance, please try to take it. But I don’t think that it is.

ARCHIVIST
(breath) Georgie, I don’t underst–

GEORGIE
Take care of yourself.

[The Archivist lets out another shaky breath. Georgie leaves, closing the door behind her.]
ARCHIVIST
Wh– I – (sigh) (quicker) What about you? Disappointed to see me alive? Basira?

BASIRA
We can deal with it later.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
(small) Yeah.

(breath) Yeah, okay.

[More heavy breathing.]
BASIRA
Do you want me to grab you some water, or…?

ARCHIVIST
No – ah, the, the, uh, the statement. In your, in your bag.

BASIRA
Oh. Yeah, I uh, (unzips her bag) I just grabbed one on the way out; I thought maybe you’d need it for –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping, quick) You, you were right – I, I think it would do me some good. Do you have a tape re– Oh.

[He sighs.]
BASIRA
How did you know I brought one? (pause) Right.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Thank you, Basira.

BASIRA
Hm.

[She leaves, and we catch a whiff of hallway bustle as the door shuts behind her. John lets out another deep sigh.]
ARCHIVIST
Statement of uh, (something catches in his throat, he swallows) Uh, Lorell St. John regarding, uh… (huh) (disbelief) …zombies. Original statement given 1st February, 2015. Recording by (labored breath) Jonathan Sims. The Archivist.

Statement begins.

[As he reads the statement, his voice slowly, incrementally starts to improve.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
People always used to tell me I was… solipsistic. They said that I – never really engaged with other people, never acted like they really existed, or mattered, at least not in the same way that I did. I suppose in, in many ways they were right. It’s hard to explain without sounding stupid.

Obviously other people are real – (stammering) O-obviously, the, the way a building is real, or my watch is real. They exist. If people weren’t real, I’m sure I’d find them much less of a chore.

So no, I don’t not believe in other people. I just find it very difficult to feel for others, I, I can’t understand them, and they’ve always seemed…oh there’s no tactful way to say it – they’ve always seemed… pointless. I know what my pain feels like, and I know what my joy feels like, but when I see those same things on the faces of my friends, or my enemies, I feel… Well that’s it, isn’t it? I don’t really feel anything. Their emotions and suffering feel as distant to me as a character on a movie screen. More distant, really.

I-In many ways I find those crude characters that wander through ridiculous plot after ridiculous plot more relatable than the people watching next to me. That said, Danielle did tell me once that films tended to depict characters like that so it’s easier to project yourself onto them. So maybe it isn’t quite as surprising as all that. I like animals, too. They don’t pretend to be important. So, assuming you can understand anything, I would hope that you could understand why the philosophical concept of zombies might worm its way into my mind.

Danielle studies philosophy. W-Well, she studied philosophy. And she was one of those people who loved to talk to other people about it, try to explain it as a way of internalizing the information, so come exam season, her favorite revision method was to try and explain a year’s worth of dusty old white men thinking about existence to me.

She said it really helped, and, well – sometimes I didn’t have anything better to do. It never stuck, of course; it’s all kind of rubbish, really – people trying to think the universe into making sense, coming up with all sorts of nonsense and trying to claim that ‘if you can imagine it it must be true.’ I’m, I’m grossly oversimplifying, of course, but I don’t care. I don’t think Danielle did very well in her exams.

I remember the night she told me about zombies. It was dark outside and must have been late. It was high summer, and the days were long. And sweltering. Our building really kept the heat, and had very few opening windows, so even in the evening that humid warmth seemed to stick around. One of our housemates, Liam, was sat at the other end of the living room, playing some obnoxious video game. He had the lights at that end of the room turned off, and the screen lit up his blank, gormless face as he stared at some space monster or other that he had to kill.

Danielle explained that a philosophical zombie is someone who outwardly displays all the signs of life and consciousness: they talk; they laugh; they scream; they even appear to think. But they have no inner life at all, no actual subjective experience. It’s all a, a rule, a, a conjuring trick. If you cut them, they’d bleed, they might even cry out, but they wouldn’t actually feel any pain, because they can’t actually feel anything. It’s all just an act.

(laughing) I said to Danielle, “Like Liam,” a-and she laughed, at what she assumed was a funny joke, and tried to explain it again, told me they weren’t real, that it was all a, a thought experiment, and the fact that you could imagine them was supposed to counter some other philosopher, who sounded equally meaningless.

But, like I said, I don’t think she got a very good grade, and looking at Liam, blankly staring into that glowing square on the wall, I, I knew she was wrong. They were real. His eyes were so dark, and – dull. Empty windows to a soul that – he didn’t really have.

I started to do some… experiments on him. N-not many, just a few little ones here and there to… see. I suppose you might’ve called them cruel, if Liam was capable of suffering; he certainly pretended to cry out in pain when I accidentally cut his hand while chopping onions, and he did a good impression of grief when his fish died. But his eyes were always the same: cold. And empty.

I didn’t do anything about it, obviously; what was the point? There was no real harm in him going out into the world pretending to live his life; it was no skin off my nose, certainly.

It wasn’t just him, though. There were… so many more of them out there. At one point I did legitimately entertain the notion that they might all be zombies. Every one. That it was just me. That I was the only real person that existed. But, no, that wasn’t right; it was just certain people; I watched their reactions, the emotions they didn’t quite get right, and I knew they were a facade.

It became like a game to me. Watching out for those… soulless husks. Whether on the bus, the street, or even meeting a client for work, I would look into their eyes for just a second, and see the emptiness inside. I tried to make it a game, at least. The truth was, they scared me very deeply. What were they? How did it happen; were they – born hollow, or did something scoop them out, leave them like that?

And the question that kept me up, staring into the darkness late at night – why did it seem like I was the only one able to see them? I saw so many people, real people, chatting with these zombies, talking to them as if they were able to understand what was being said to them, rather than simply pretending. How was it that they couldn’t see the quiet void that lurked behind each of their smiles. And there seemed to be more and more of them every day. Sometimes I found myself utterly alone. Facing down a room full of nothing eyes, willing myself to take action.

I never did, though. Not even when one of them started following me. I first saw him in the street; it wasn’t difficult to guess what he was; half the people around him were just as hollow and soulless. But there was something else, to him. He was tall. But not so tall as to stick out. Thin, but not unhealthily so. He wore a blue t-shirt despite the falling temperature, and his short, dark hair and pale skin surrounded a smile so fake, it practically glowed.

He stared at me as I walked past, not making a move to follow or stop me; nor did his eyes seem to actually… move. It was like one of those paintings that watch you; it just seemed that whatever place I looked at him from, he just happened to be focused on me. In as much as there was any focus in them at all. Vacant.

The next day he was there again, this time in the hallway outside my office, standing in the center, so that I had to hug the wall to avoid touching his… motionless form. He was identical. Except that his t-shirt was now a dull orange.

I asked my colleague Norma what she thought of him, why he was there, and if she noticed anything strange about him. She looked out into the corridor, then, back at me and shook her head. She told me he seemed normal enough. But her eyes were like blank pits, and I knew she was lying about all of it.

Had he done this? Had he taken Norma’s..s-self, h-her soul, or… or had she always been a zombie? Cramped, into a little open-plan desk, patiently listening to client complaints, and I just hadn’t noticed? I looked around my office, a low dread starting to build as he waited outside. A numbing cavity wrapped in skin.

I tried to talk to him, when he stood next to me on the bus. I played as casual as I could, trying not to seem afraid when I asked him how his day was going.

“Just fine, thank you for asking,” came the flat, uninterested response.

Then I, I asked him his name. “Just fine, thank you for asking,” he said.

I have never wanted anything as much as I wanted in that moment to cut him, and see if he pretended to scream in pain.

By the time he appeared outside my house, this time wearing a rotten green t-shirt, I could feel a numbness in myself even as I looked at him. Was I finally becoming like them? My internal world melting away into nothing but a pantomime? I remember I ran at him, all my rage burning inside my chest as though desperate to remind myself that I could still feel something.

I think I might have been screaming, but the memory is fuzzy. I remember I punched him in the face, though. When my fist connected, it was like punching a canvas. Taught, dry, and – yielding, ever so slightly, until all at once it broke with a tearing pop and all that resistance was gone, my fist falling into the empty space behind it.

Inside his head, I-I pulled my hand back in sudden disgust, and he looked at me, through the torn and bloodless hole in his head. I could see one blank eye hanging down off his face, still following me, as his split mouth moved to try and form the words that I could hear clear as day: “Just fine, thank you for asking.”

They’re all like that now. You’re all like that, I suppose. I have no reason to believe anyone will – (sharp breath) – read this who would be any different, no reason to believe – (same breath) – you’ll be able to read this, that you won’t simply stare blankly at this page before – performing your response, your artificial opinion. There is every chance that I am – the only one left. And the whole world has fallen to a – soulless horde, devoid of life and feeling. Even so, thank you for… pretending to care.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

(sigh) Well that – (breath) – certainly helped, I think. No notes or – followup in the statement, and… (dry laugh) obviously no research done by myself or, uh… my team. I think we can safely say that Ms. Saint-John is not the only person left in the world, though, whatever (inhale) she might be doing now. And whatever might be with her.

They can be hard, though, other, other people. Feelings. I-I’m – I’m trying to focus, trying to make sure I’m the same me as before, but… how can anyone really remember that? How do you know you’re the same person that went to sleep?

[He sighs.]
[Then there’s a faint knock-knock-knock on the door.]
ARCHIVIST
(quiet) Oh. (calling) Ah – Uhh, yes – I’m done.

[The door opens, we catch a glimpse of the hallway bustle. The Archivist takes a shaky breath.]
ARCHIVIST
Georgie, is she, um –

[He sighs.]
BASIRA
She’s gone. Didn’t see where.

ARCHIVIST
No, I, I wouldn’t have, uh.

[He sighs again.]
ARCHIVIST
Probably for the best.

BASIRA
Yeah.

[Pause.]
BASIRA
Better?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Yes, thank you.

BASIRA
Right. Then I’ve got questions.

ARCHIVIST
So do I.

BASIRA
Me first. What are you?

ARCHIVIST
I – (sigh) (shaky inhale) Honestly? I don’t know. I don’t feel… inhuman, or… I want to say I’m the same. But I don’t – really know if that’s true. I know I’m different. I feel… more real, somehow.

[Basira hms, unimpressed.]
BASIRA
So what does that actually mean?

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Probably nothing good.

[Pause. He takes another, long shaky inhale.]
ARCHIVIST
My turn. What happened to me?

BASIRA
How much do you remember?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t… Music. Everything was wrong. Gertrude was there, and then… dancing, I think. Then, pain. And I was somewhere else. Dreaming.

BASIRA
Dreaming.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. (pause) …You’re… sure, a-about Tim.

BASIRA
Yeah, they um… They found his remains a few days later.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
And – Daisy?

BASIRA
They still haven’t found her body. Probably never will. I thought for a while she might, um… (she sniffs) But, it’s been months. She’s gone.

ARCHIVIST
Just you and me. And – Melanie and M-Martin, I, I guess. (breath) Honestly, I’m surprised Martin isn’t –

[Basira takes a deep breath.]
ARCHIVIST
What? (realizing) Oh god – the, the plan, it’s – Martin i-is – is he okay, w-what – (he takes a breath to compose himself) What did Elias do?

BASIRA
No, nothing. Elias isn’t the problem.

ARCHIVIST
So – what?

BASIRA
Elias is locked up.

ARCHIVIST
Wait, Martin’s plan worked?

BASIRA
Yeah. A bunch of sectioned officers took him in. He made some sort of deal, I think, but he’s not getting out anytime soon.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. (pause) Wow, uh – o-okay, so – what’s the problem?

BASIRA
He appointed an interim director. Guy named Peter Lukas.

ARCHIVIST
Oh.

BASIRA
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
I’ve read about him.

BASIRA
Yeah, I’ve hunted down some of those old statements, and – (small sigh) Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
What did he do to Martin?

BASIRA
I… don’t know. We don’t see him around the Archives much these days. Best I can figure? He’s working on something with Lukas.

ARCHIVIST
No, that – (breath) No, that – that – There must be something else.

BASIRA
Maybe. I don’t know.

ARCHIVIST
And Melanie?

BASIRA
A lot’s happened, while you’ve been gone.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Right. (sigh) Well I guess we should probably let one of the nurses know I’m awake. (sigh) I’m sure they’ve got all sorts of – tests to do, make sure I’m not a – zombie, or… (hah) I don’t suppose you brought in any – clothes?

BASIRA
No, I just, you know, grabbed that statement on my way out.

ARCHIVIST
Right, well, uh – I kept some in the – uh – Archives, uh, in my office.

BASIRA
Yeah, those got um – we had to throw those out.

ARCHIVIST
What?

BASIRA
Like I said, a lot’s happened.

ARCHIVIST
S-since I’ve been – (inhale) Fine.

[He lets out a deep exhale.]
BASIRA
I’ll get you some new ones. Better ones.

[Pause.]
BASIRA
Anything else?

ARCHIVIST
(swallows) Water, please.

BASIRA
Sure thing.

[She opens the door and leaves.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh, or, uh, a cup of t–

[The door falls shut.]
[Long pause. The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
(almost a whisper) Okay. (sigh)

End recording, I suppose.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
(under his breath) Where did the – (sighs)

[Some shuffling as he looks through papers/whatever’s on his desk.]
(salt) Coma, great! Let’s rearrange his office. Sleeping people don’t need – pens.

[He steps in something with a squelch!]
Euagh! What –

[Something in the distance is knocking about. The Archivist sighs again, defeated, and gets up to see what the sound is. The angry knocking sound gets closer and louder as the Archivist moves towards the door.]
[The Archivist opens the door and steps out into]
[INT. MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, HALLWAY]
ARCHIVIST
Melanie! It’s very good to, uh – (surprised concern) Melanie? Are you al– WOAH!

[Something crashes. Presumably it was thrown at John.]
MELANIE
(extremely angry) Get away from me.

ARCHIVIST
Now, Melanie – i-it’s me.

MELANIE
No, no.

ARCHIVIST
No, I, I, I, I – I’m back.

MELANIE
(overlapping) No. (after Archivist) Oh! Oh, yeah, back to your happy little family?

ARCHIVIST
What; no! I j– I didn’t mean to –

MELANIE
How did you make it out then, hm?

ARCHIVIST
What?

MELANIE
Tim is dead. Daisy is dead, and you – what, you’re just fine?

ARCHIVIST
What – no! I’ve been in hospital for six months!

MELANIE
Something has been in hospital. Something that’s got your face, like – I warned Basira; I said not to let you back in here, but she just (increasingly angry; starts slamming [the wall]) doesn’t! listen!

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Melanie, Melanie, it’s – it’s me.

MELANIE
Oh! Okay, so it’s what, hi John, how are you, get anyone killed lately?

ARCHIVIST
(dumbstruck) I – I –

MELANIE
Wipe that look off of your face. Like you’re not the reason all of this is happening! (she takes a breath) Like you’re any better than [unintelligible] –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) (stammering)

MELANIE
– than him!

ARCHIVIST
– B,B,B,Basira said Elias was gone!

MELANIE
Oh, gone, right, yes, yes, he is (she takes a breath and sighs) he’s gone. Like that makes any difference.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t understand.

MELANIE
No! You don’t, do you? He’s still alive. You are still alive. So this place is still –

[She starts to take big, heaving breaths, almost to the point of tears.]
ARCHIVIST
Melanie, Melanie, this isn’t you –

MELANIE
Get back! off!

[She pushes the Archivist and he grunts.]
MELANIE
You don’t know me. And I don’t know you, so stay the hell away from me or I swear I will –

ARCHIVIST
(as one would to a riled up grizzly bear) Okay.

[Melanie takes a deep, guttural breath.]
ARCHIVIST
Okay.

[He opens and steps back through the door to INT. MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, JOHN’S OFFICE]
ARCHIVIST
Okay.

[He takes a long, shaky breath.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
ARCHIVIST
She nearly attacked me, Basira. I know me and Melanie haven’t always seen eye to eye before, but – (sigh) Christ!

BASIRA
Yeah, I did warn you. She’s not uh… She’s not been having a good time.

ARCHIVIST
(oh, really?) Mm. Yes, I did get that impression. (sigh) Elias is gone. I thought – I mean, wasn’t that supposed to be – it. (breath) But she is still –

BASIRA
It’s not that simple.

ARCHIVIST
She needs help, Basira. God, it didn’t even get like that with – (slower, neutral) Even Tim never threatened me. Not like that.

BASIRA
Alright, just back off. You haven’t been here.

ARCHIVIST
O-okay. You’re right. I haven’t. So explain it to me.

[Basira sighs.]
BASIRA
Alright. Best I can understand it, Beholding, or the Eye, or… whatever you wanna call it, we’re one of the only powers that hasn’t taken a shot at a ritual. Yet. And everything out there knows it.

ARCHIVIST
No – I mean, we can’t be the only ones, surely.

BASIRA
(sigh) I don’t know. Probably not. But we made a big noise with the Unknowing and… other stuff and now they’ve taken notice. We’re safe in here, usually. But we don’t go out much anymore.

ARCHIVIST
Usually.

BASIRA
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
You were attacked. When?

BASIRA
About two months ago. It was, uh, it was the Flesh.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, god.

BASIRA
Yeah, it was bad. We took them all out. Melanie did most of them. She was… she got a knife from somewhere and –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Basira I-I don’t know if that’s a good sign?

BASIRA
She saved my life, John. She saved all of us. I won’t forget that.

ARCHIVIST
(sighs) Fine. Fine.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Haven’t seen Martin about.

BASIRA
Yeah, he comes and goes. He’s busy.

Well, he seems it.

ARCHIVIST
Working for Peter Lukas.

BASIRA
Don’t be too hard on him, John. Your, uh, situation. It hit him. Hard.

ARCHIVIST
(sighs) Yes. Well, I’m sure there are better ways to deal with it than getting – cozy with Elias’s successor. Who I’ve yet to meet, by the way.

[Basira laughs, mirthless.]
BASIRA
Yeah, join the club.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry, you haven’t? –

BASIRA
Nope. Never seen him. Far as I can tell, Martin’s the only one who has.

ARCHIVIST
R-right. A-and you’re sure he’s…real?

BASIRA
We get emails from him. Memos.

[The Archivist laughs in disbelief.]
BASIRA
He’s been restructuring. Separating out the departments a bit. Not a surprise, I guess, with his pedigree.

ARCHIVIST
But i-if you’ve never seen him, I mean…

BASIRA
(sighs) Rumor is a couple of researchers up on the third floor decided to ignore some of his new directives, and… whoosh.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry, what’s whoosh?

BASIRA
Whoosh. Gone.

ARCHIVIST
Oh.

[He laughs, but it, too, is humorless.]
The more things change… So, we’re under siege, Melanie is aggressively unstable, Martin is working very closely with – The Lonely, who is predictably enough isolating him, and, oh, yes, uh, Tim and Daisy are still dead. (laughing) Which is at least easy to keep track of.

BASIRA
That isn’t funny, John.

ARCHIVIST
I know it’s not – (pause) Sorry. It’s just – it’s a lot.

[He sighs, quietly.]
And we’ve got an audience. Perfect. I thought you said you decided to throw them all out.

BASIRA
Yep. And I did. And here’s another one.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe it’s hungry.

BASIRA
Seriously.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I did have a statement I was planning to record.

BASIRA
Great. Perfect. You can get on with that, and I’ll just leave, then.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Ah, what do I do if Melanie comes back?

BASIRA
I don’t know. Play dead.

[She opens the door and starts to leave.]
ARCHIVIST
Right.

[The door shuts behind her.]
[Some papers shuffle as he gets the statement ready.]
ARCHIVIST
Statement of Angie Santos, regarding a website developed by one Gregory Cox. Original statement given 1st August, 2015. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Okay, for this to make any… real kind of sense, you sort of need to know Greg. Or, at least, understand how he works. Don’t… misunderstand me, please, I, I’m very fond of the man, but I have never in my life encountered anyone quite so… passive. So willing to go along with whatever situation he finds himself in. No matter how awkward or uncomfortable he might be, he just seems to… accept his position.

Actually, now I think about it, it’s more that his being uncomfortable actually makes him more likely to… dig in, to double down on whatever’s happening, as if increasing his investment in a thing will somehow make it easier to endure.

To give you an example, I first met him about seven years ago, when he was twenty-six. At that point he’d just got out of his first real relationship, and it was one that had lasted nearly a decade. To hear him talk about it, it sounded like he’d never actually been happy. I mean, it didn’t even sound like happiness was a consideration for him when thinking about it. For the last – four years of the relationship, she had just treated him worse and worse, taken more and more liberties, and he’d just tried to – shrug it off. He still does. He wasn’t even the one to end things. She’d found herself a rich older guy, fresh from a divorce, and just – disappeared. Something Greg once described as “fair enough, I suppose.”

Oh, as another example, when I was first getting to know Greg, I went for a drink with him, that I mistakenly thought was romantic. I mean, he’s not a bad looking guy. But he’d intended the evening as purely platonic. Do you know how long we “dated,” before I realized what had happened and actually pressed him on the whole misunderstanding? Two months. Sometimes I think if I’d just been a little more oblivious, we’d be married by now.

Anyway, all of this is to try and explain why, when it started to get really weird, Greg didn’t just quit the job. I mean, it’s a freelance web project, and from what he said it doesn’t even pay very well. He wouldn’t be breaking any contract, and (breath) the client hardly ever even gets in touch. There is no reason he couldn’t just walk away, but I honestly don’t think he ever will. And I really don’t know how it’s going to end for him.

I knew it was going to be bad as soon as he started telling me about it; I mean, Greg doesn’t really talk about work unless something’s gone badly and he wants to not listen to me tell him to drop whatever project he’s locked himself into.

And this job was red flags all the way down. (sigh) An email out of the blue from what looked like a personal address rather than a business one. Vague, occasionally contradictory descriptions of what they actually wanted the site to do; I mean – even the email was a bit strange, not the broken or algorithmic English I’d have expected; the short passage was – quite well-composed.

But for some reason, something in it caused the font to appear incredibly large, and Greg had had to scroll through almost word by word. None of it was exactly what you’d call a good sign, but… Greg being Greg, he was taking a train down to Guildford before you know it, to meet the client in person. Small coffeeshop just off the High Street.

As he told it, she was young, rail-thin underneath an oversized brown hoodie, which she kept pulled up, trying to cover up a network of pale stitches that stretched over one side of her head. She didn’t – say much, other than to briefly outline the job. She wanted a forum made, though she couldn’t seem to explain exactly what audience or topic she wanted it to be targeted towards, or why she couldn’t use one of the countless online services that specifically made and admined forums. She just mumbled something about custom requirements and told Greg to drink his latte, which he did, so he tells me, though he can’t stand milk in his coffee. All through it she just kept staring at him, hands pressed into the pockets of her hoodie, occasionally pushing long, spindly fingers out against the fabric, smiling to herself.

I haven’t given the name of this mystery client because, to be honest, Greg’s never told me. I’ve asked him, plenty of times, but whenever I do, he gives me this… surprised look, insists he’s told me before, and then immediately forgets and changes the subject. I know that’s not exactly helpful, but – honestly I’m a bit lost here myself. I mean – none of this feels normal, some of it doesn’t even feel natural. Greg’s an odd one, sure, but – until recently, he’s always been very sharp.

This was all about six months ago. He’s been working on the website ever since. Set up took him all of two days, maybe more, since the client insisted on him coding from scratch. It was bare bones, since he’d been given no copy, or indication of how it was to be organized, except for the name of the site: Chelicerae, which he made sure stood prominently at the top in a tasteful Sans Serif.

The client had requested only a single area where threads could be posted, labeled ‘come in.’ Of course, there was never anything in there. The site was called Chelicerae, but the URL, the web address, was nothing like the name. Just a long string of numbers and letters with no pattern or reason to them, almost impossible to memorize. Once the site was live, Greg would get an email every few weeks with a new domain name, another long string of gibberish, and he would have to change it all over.

There were… other things, though, that the client would email through. Things that she insisted were included not on the website itself, but in the code. I-I’m not really a computer person, but according to Greg, they had nothing to do with any coding language he’d ever seen. Meaningless strings of words, or weird little fragments of poetry, or a name, different every time, repeated over and over again, hundreds of times. He tried to explain to her, more than once, that just pasting these things into the code wouldn’t – cause them to appear on the page, or have any effect at all. But she insisted, so he did it. And he’s been doing it ever since.

He’s on some sort of retainer to administrate the site, and this amounts to changing the domain name every few weeks, checking the statistics that, yes, still no one has visited, and pasting whatever the latest nonsense the client wants in the code. I’d have said it was good money for doing basically nothing, except that for the last two months it’s all started to go… really, really weird.

It started with an email he got from a hotmail address he didn’t recognize. The subject line was simply “Are you the Chelicerae?” At first, Greg thought his client must have passed his details on, but opening the message, there were just four more words: “Please make it stop.”

[The static of the tape recorder in the background gets louder.]
Now, Greg being Greg, he just – deleted the message and pretended it didn’t bother him. But after he told me about it, I pressed him further, and he admitted that it wasn’t the first unsettling email he’d gotten from strangers about the site. He wouldn’t tell me the others. He kept insisting that I drop it, that it was fine. That I shouldn’t worry. But of course I did worry. I knew that, secretly, he was as well.

I started to do a bit of – searching online, just to see if there was anything we were missing. And there was. A lot, as it turns out. I-It didn’t take more than an hour or so to discover that Greg had apparently found himself the web administrator for an urban legend.

The Chelicerae popped up on the occasional paranormal site or edgy message board, each time accompanied by a now-defunct link. According to those who followed such things, all you had to do was start a new thread as a Guest, something Greg had been instructed to make sure was possible, and the title of that thread should be the name of someone you want dead.

As the stories went, you would receive a reply almost immediately, and it would simply ask you for a story. You would have to write out, and post, in full, a horrible event that had happened to you, or someone that you loved. All the instructions were very clear that the target would only die, if the account satisfied the “Story-spinner.” None of them made any mention of what would happen if it did not.

Pretty standard fare spooky stuff; at least, I would have thought so, if it hadn’t been for the messages that Greg kept getting. Someone more technically adept than him had clearly found his email associated with the site, and had posted about it, so he had become the de facto mailbox for this… (sigh) forum.

Greg swore blind the site had never received any visitors at all, never had a single thing posted in it.

But still the emails came.

[The static increases intensity again.]
“Bring them back.” “What is happening?” “I’m sorry I lied.”

It’s been getting to him; I know it has. He’s lost weight. He rarely goes out anymore, and, judging by the cobwebs, he definitely doesn’t clean his house like he used to. I’ve tried talking to him, but it’s like talking to a brick wall that refuses to admit it’s crumbling. That’s why it’s me here rather than him; I mean – I had to talk to someone.

We were… walking home from The Cricketer’s, uhh, a pub just off Horsell Birch. We were heading back to his house, since I’d missed my last train, and when that happened I tended to sleep on his sofa. We were turning down into his road when there was a small voice from a doorway next to us, asking for help.

Now, the last few years there had been a lot more homeless folk around Woking – I know, welcome to Tory Britain – but my point is, Greg usually made a point of giving whatever change he had left from the pub to… whoever we stumbled across on our way back. So when we heard this, he turned towards the voice and held out his hand towards the dark, crumpled shape, offering some change. (pause)

What grabbed his wrist was not a hand. Not exactly, not – anymore. It was coarse and bony and covered in fine, sharp hairs. Greg screamed, falling backwards, pulling the figure under the street lamp where, for a second, I saw it more completely than he did.

It was definitely human once. At least, based on how it was screaming. But it was thin, with bits of twisted and discolored, covered in small, scurrying shapes. Its face was the most human part of it remaining. Except for the two black and hollow spaces where its eyes once were. From which now poured an endless stream of scuttling legs and fangs. Its mouth was full of them too, but I could see, as it grasped desperately at Greg; it was trying to say: “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Tell her I’m sorry,” but words were not what tumbled from those lips.

We ran, of course; th-the thing was frantic but clumsy, and it wasn’t difficult to get away. I wanted to go to the police, to tell them everything, but Greg – refused, of course. He said there must have been some mistake, that it was just a-a tramp, with an unfortunate condition. That he wasn’t going to bother the police, just because we’d had a bit of a shock. I didn’t have the energy to argue with him. I still don’t, really.

I don’t know what to think. Greg’s my best friend, but I might have to stop seeing him. He’s still working on that site, updating the domain name, still pasting gibberish into the code. I think he might be part of something really awful, and I don’t know how to make him see that.

If I had… a little bit more courage, I might just hang around a few message boards I know, waiting for a link to the Chelicerae. Waiting to post a name that might end it. (pause) I’ve got a story for it, all right. But I won’t. I’m just – too much of a coward, I suppose. So I guess I’m telling it to you instead. For all the good that’ll do.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends. (shaky sigh)

The Web does seem to have a preference for those who prefer not to assert themselves. The investigation is tricky – I don’t want to impose on Basira, and obviously Melanie and – (brief noise) – Martin aren’t available.

But I did do some light searching myself on Gregory Cox. Vanished, unsurprisngly. Sometime in late July 2016, which I think is… (mirthless laugh) two years ago. That doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t feel like – There’s just this great… gap of time where I wasn’t.

No notes or followup here that I can see, just… (sigh) It looks like this statement came in just after Gertrude disappeared. Another gap. And whoever took it didn’t do any follow-up, just… filed it away. I may be the first person to actually read it, so… (same mirthless cough of a laugh) Sorry, Angie. I suppose. (sigh)

There’s a small supplemental document with it, though, that is a – bit alarming. I-It’s apparently a list of people whose names appeared in the various pieces of text Mr. Cox was pasting into the code. It’s unclear if they were meant to be users or victims, but I cannot help but note that there seem to be the names of several statement givers who found their way to the Institute, including noted arachnophobe Carlos Vittery. Perhaps a coincidence, just people shopping their traumatic incidents around, but…but I have to wonder… how much their actions were their own.

I have no theories on this. No – no sudden insights. (sigh) I wish I could talk it through with Martin. Or Tim. Or Sasha. But we never really did that, did we? (sigh) Everything’s changed. (shaky, long breath)

Two days out of a coma, and I’m already tired.

Statement of Julian Jennings regarding a cable car journey up the Untersberg mountain in Austria. Original statement given 11th December, 2012. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The part that really gets me is that it wasn’t even our first time going up that cable car. I mean, none of it makes sense; it was all impossible, and the terrible things that happened while we were hanging there absolutely could not have happened. But given that they did, I don’t understand why they happened to us. There was nothing – special about us, nothing remarkable about our trip. Were we just random bystanders to something awful? We must have been, because I don’t see why anyone would choose for something to happen to us. It must have been the old man, of course, but again, why?

My father passed away almost twelve years ago, now. Pancreatic cancer. I’m sure I don’t need to explain that it was devastating, probably the first true grief I’ve ever felt, but in the years that followed, I found that it brought me much closer to my mum. Her and dad were always something of a unit, you see, and growing up I feel like I had less of a specific relationship with them as people, and more of a relationship with my parents. Not unusual, but once I moved out and started to get on with my own life, we ended up becoming a bit distant. And on the few times a year that I would see them, it was, again, going to visit my parents, without any real thought for the individual relationships.

This all ended with my father’s death. Grief brought mum and me closer than we’d ever been before. I would call her regularly, and I’d make the trip up to Swansea at least once a month, until I finally moved back there four years ago. It was the second year after dad passed that we started our annual holiday together. At first it was just a way to get Mum more… interested in the world again, but soon enough it was a highlight of our year. We’d go for a week, normally, maybe two if I’d kept back enough annual leave. Mum wasn’t great with flights, so we tended to keep ourselves to central or western Europe, though I got her as far as Corfu one year. Her big passion was mountains; we always had to go up a mountain.

Well, to be fair, it wasn’t mountains she loved, specifically; it was views. There was little that delighted Mum quite as much as to see the whole of creation spread out before you like a carpet, and we would always burn through a good number of euros using whatever coin-operated telescopes they’d set out at the lookout spot.

She also found an affinity for the thinner air of high altitudes. I never really understood how that worked, as I thought it was meant to make it harder to breathe, and after a few hours I always tended to get a bit of a headache. But mum took to it like nobody’s business and after a minute or two was always more spry than I’d seen her the whole rest of the year.

Of course, at her age actually… climbing a mountain would have been a bit much, so our holidays were very much intended to be the highest peaks in central and western Europe that could be scaled by coach, train, or cable car. Well-supplied as many European mountains are with public transport options, this did limit us a bit. So, that’s why this year we found ourselves returning to Salzburg, one of our first ever destinations, and to Untersberg, one of our favorite mountains. It towered distantly over the city. It was a marvelous view, if I recall, although the quickest and most reliable way to reach it was unfortunately by cable car.

You see, I don’t do amazingly with heights. I wouldn’t describe it as full vertigo, and certainly when we’re actually at the top of the mountain, I don’t have any problem at all if I steer clear of the edges. But, traditionally, getting from sea level up to the top is something of a trial to me, to say nothing of coming back down. I’ve never really shared these fears with Mum, of course; she got so much joy out of it that I wouldn’t want to worry her.

Anyway, I remember the cable car up and down Untersberg was a particularly uncomfortable one for me. As the car accelerated towards the rickety looking pylons, there was this judder as the runners abruptly changed angles, and the car would swing back and forth in such a way that I had to sit down on the floor. I told Mum this was because I found hard to balance, but honestly it was so I didn’t have to look out the window at the ground almost a mile below.

When we arrived at the cable car station this time I was relieved to see that they had seemed to have replaced a lot of the structure since the first time we were there. The cables stretched up the mountain, fresh and strong, though still with that disconcerting curve t them, and there was a shine to the cars themselves that I really hoped wasn’t just a fresh paint job.(laugh) Mum appeared quite composed, but in that way she does when she gets excited, and we bought our tickets and joined the queue without any problems.

It was near the end of the season, and we’d arrived as early as possible, so the queue in this case only comprised of one other passenger: an old man with stark white hair and a gentle, amused smile. He had a walking stick in his hand, though his back was straight as an arrow, and it seemed like he only remembered to use it in those moments when he noticed he was still holding it.

The day was clear, and the sun illuminated the inside of the car as we stepped over the gap from the platform. I knew we would be able to see for miles and miles from the top, something I was looking forward to doing when I had my feet firmly on the mountain, less so from the swinging car.

The driver stood in the corner of the tiny metal box, looking at us with a bored expression and making some final checks on the controls, which amounted to two buttons and a phone. I sat, slightly unsteadily, on the rough steel bench, as mum and the old man took positions at two of the windows with the best view. The driver nodded to himself, slid the door closed, and turned a key in the control panel. There was a shuddering through the whole structure of the car as the wheels above us began to turn, and we began to climb towards the peak.

In some ways, the first minute is the worst. The climb takes just over eight minutes in total, but in those first few seconds you can see all the detail of the ground as it falls away from you, and you feel every meter of that widening space of open air beneath your feet, held at bay by a floor that seems… far too thin.

By the second minute, I’d calmed down slightly, the angle of the cable and our speed of ascent having leveled out, and the third minute was… almost peaceful. I risked a look over to mum, stood at the window looking out with a serene smile at the retreating ground. I glanced over to the old man, whose face beamed with excitement and… anticipation.

Minute four was when we hit the first of the three support towers, and the sudden change of angle and speed sent me gripping the edge of my seat, staring resolutely at the floor and willing myself to ignore the swaying of the car.

The fifth minute, I risked another look out the windows, just as we hit the second tower, and my stomach lurched. I sat back down again quickly, hoping the shaking of my legs wasn’t audible to my mother, still staring out of her chosen window.

The sixth minute was the last stretch with just open air below us, and it would have been the final part before we hit the last tower and started traveling over the mountain itself. But that’s when the car came to a sudden, juddering halt.

Panic immediately pumped through me, and I clenched my teeth together to try and hold in a cry. I took a moment and let out a shaky breath. It was fine. This sort of thing happened all the time, no doubt; just a small delay. Someone at the top taking too long for the car coming down the other way, maybe.

I glanced at the driver, and, sure enough, he had a look of puzzlement and irritation on his face, but nothing that could be read as concern, or fear. He picked up the phone next to the controls and started speaking annoyed German into it, but from his expression it didn’t seem like he was getting any answers. I heard similar sounds of irritation from Mum, and gingerly looking over, I noticed that some low-level clouds had come about us, and the window was now covered with a fine, swirling mist, obscuring the view below.

The weather had been forecast as clear skies – but it wasn’t unheard of. I would have hoped that not being able to see the earth, far below us, would have blunted the terror I felt as we hung there, swinging gently, but instead it seemed worse, as all I could now picture was an unending, terrible void, stretching out below me.

I heard a small chuckle, and looked over to see the old man smiling to himself, his walking stick discarded on the floor.

What happened next was so fast I barely had time to process it. The old man turned towards the door of the cable car, the door I had seen the driver secure and lock when we first boarded… and he walked over to it. He gripped the handle, and with a single, easy motion, flung it open.

The driver saw what was happening and started to lunge to grab him, but it was too late. The old man turned back for just a second, looked me in the eyes and gave me a huge, theatrical wink. Then he fell backwards, out of the car, and was gone, into the swirling air beyond.

The driver shouted – something – and my mother let out a shriek, but the sounds disappeared into the muted skies surrounding us. The driver was back on the phone, desperately trying to get someone on the other end as the door just hung there, open into the nothingness beyond the car.

I wanted to act, to help, to do something, but I was pinned to my seat, with a confused fear. Then, without warning, and without any input from the driver, the car began to move again. It traveled upwards, gaining speed and swinging with such force I was afraid that we’d all we thrown out of the open door.

One minute. Two minutes.

Three minutes.

We should have hit another tower, or the top of the mountain by now, but we just kept going, higher, and higher, the clouds surrounding us tighter, flowing in through the open door. My mind had all but seized up, and I felt helpless to do anything but watch as events progressed.

I don’t know how long we climbed before the car stopped again. Mum was crouched on the floor, now, gripping the handlebars above her for stability, and the driver was trying to get any response from the controls. The brakes finally started again with such grinding force that we must have pitched almost 45 degrees forward. Then back again. Then forward. I could feel nausea wash over me as I was almost thrown forward onto the floor. Then everything was still again, save for the gentle swaying.

The car remained in place for some time. I think we were all just waiting, for whatever was coming next. None of us spoke, and looking over at Mum I could see my own fear mirrored across her face. After a while, when everything had calmed down, the driver looked over to us. We were all quiet, afraid, I think, of breaking the stillness we found ourselves in. But I saw him start to edge towards the door. I knew what he was trying to do. He wanted to close it, lock it back in place and get some semblance of control back.

I wanted to tell him to stop, to warn him about – whatever was about to happen, because I knew something was about to happen. But I could only stare at him as he slowly, achingly crawled towards his doom.

Sure enough, as he approached the opening, his hand just starting to reach out into the mist, I heard something on the cables stretched out behind us. I didn’t turn around, but I could hear rhythmic, scraping sounds of something crawling rapidly towards us. I saw Mum’s eyes focus on something behind my head, and she screamed. It was a sound I’ve never heard her make in my whole life, and one that I will never forget.

There was a thump from above, the sound of something heavy landing on the roof of the car, and the driver froze, arms still outstretched. His eyes widened in sudden realization, but before he could pull back from the edge, an arm, long, grey, and completely inhuman, reached down from above with terrible speed. It grabbed his wrist, just for a moment, and then he was gone, his own scream vanishing into the abyss beyond the door.

In the quiet that followed, Mum and I just stared at each other, neither of us knowing what we could do except wait for whatever fate was…squatting on top of the cable car. Then came three bangs, one after another on the roof of the car. Knock. Knock. Knock. Then a laugh. A terrible whistling sound, like the howling of a gale. And then…

I don’t know when I noticed the green light on the control panel. The one next to the button the driver had held when we first started the journey. It certainly hadn’t been lit the last time we were moving. Maybe not since the first time we stopped.

I couldn’t afford to let hope come into my heart, knew that would be too cruel, but I also knew I couldn’t ignore it. I finally, painfully stood up. My whole body was shaking so violently I thought I would collapse before I’d even taken my first step, but little by little I inched my way towards it, never taking my eyes off the green light. Never looking towards the door.

When my fingers finally found the button, I slammed it with all the strength I had left in me, and I felt the car begin to move upwards again. I have no idea if whatever was on top of the car was still there, but when I saw the third tower rising up out of the clouds, I could feel myself weeping with relief. I didn’t even feel the juddering as we hit it.

I don’t remember much after that. I don’t think I was making much sense. I know it took them a long time to get us back down from the top of Untersberg without using the cable car. I remember talking to the police, even if I don’t remember whether I told them the truth.

I think the official story became that the driver, a man named Otto Hessler, had killed himself halfway up the mountain by leaping to his death. The body was never found, and the report made no mention of an old man.

I still get nightmares, of course, and my fear of heights has worsened considerably. I’ve tried talking to professionals about it, but for the most part they treat it as though I’m talking in metaphors. And I generally let them believe that.

The worst part is the strain the whole affair has put on my relationship with my mother. She… refuses to admit any of it happened, repeating the same version of events given by the Salzburg police. She looks me right in the eyes and tells me she doesn’t know what I’m talking about, that there was no old man or clouds. Nothing climbing the cables behind me. We both know she’s lying. I don’t know if there’ll be any more holidays, certainly none that involve mountains. (shaky breath)

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

(sighs) Simon Fairchild is one of the… recurrent figures that I think disquiets me the most. Not simply for what he does, the endless spaces of height or depth to which he’s so quick to condemn his victims, but… the joy he seems to take in doing so. And I don’t think there is much to this tale beyond that; an evil man tormenting and killing simply for his own pleasure, and to feed the power that sustains him. (sigh) In other cases, I might…think the location noteworthy, might try to piece together some wider plan, but Fairchild seems to travel far and wide for his victims, with no motivation other than… variety. I do not think I ever wish to meet him.

Of course… even if I did want to do research into this statement I wouldn’t have any help doing so. It’s been a week and Melanie’s attitude towards me hasn’t softened. And Basira, though she is very willing to talk, still doesn’t seem to trust me enough to let me in on whatever plans she might have. If she has any plans at all, of course. I could – make her tell me; I know that, but… I can’t afford to burn any more bridges.

Still no sign of Peter Lukas of course, (sighs) or Mar–

[A small static begins to build slightly in the background.]
Wait. Wait.

[He gets out of his chair and opens the door.]
Martin! (slightly louder) Martin!

MARTIN
(surprised) Oh – (pause, seems to compose himself) Hi, John.

ARCHIVIST
Martin, i-i-i-it’s – I-I, I-I haven’t seen you!

MARTIN
Yeah. Sorry.

ARCHIVIST
W-What, where, where have you been, I, I mean I,I thought –

MARTIN
Oh – No, no I’ve, I’ve been here, I just, um, y’know… been busy.

ARCHIVIST
Busy.

MARTIN
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Working for Lukas.

MARTIN
Ah, N-no, P-Peter’s – (sighs) [[clipped syllable]] (composes himself) It’s complicated.

[Beat.]
ARCHIVIST
Right.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
Anyway, I… should, uh [get back to] –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) H-how are you, Martin? I-Is everything…

MARTIN
Yeah. Yeah, no, I’m, I’m alright, uh… everything’s… fine.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Um… how’s… h-how’s the poetry?

MARTIN
Oh, uh, well, I haven’t exactly had a lot of time recently, so…

ARCHIVIST
Yes, of course.

[Martin hms]
ARCHIVIST
You’ve been busy.

MARTIN
Yeah.

[Pause.]
Look, John, I – (sighs) I’ve really got to go –

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh. Okay.

MARTIN
(overlapping) I’m sorry.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) W,w,we’ll – it was – good – (softer) It was good to see you.

MARTIN
…Yeah.

Statement of Sergeant Terrence Simpson, regarding an outbreak of violence in the crofting community of Lancraig, Ross-shire. Original statement given 19th July, 1993. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The thing is I wasn’t even responding to a call out. Well, I mean I was, but it was a break-in about ten miles further on, and I just wasn’t in a hurry. I mean, Lancraig is the sort of place you don’t even notice you’ve been through if you’re not looking. A half mile of road with a handful of white or stone cottages dotting the fields. Nothing you’d recognize as a shop, and it’s two miles the other way to the post office.

Lancraig is what they write on the map, but to most people it’s just… more empty highland. It’s like that with a lot of old crofting communities. They’ve all got their little parcel of land for farming and a big ol’ stretch to keep the sheep together, but it’s a poor life, really, and hard work. Lends itself to isolation well. Too well, sometimes.

I knew Callum McKenzie, or at the very least, he knew me. Again, not well, but North Highlands police tend to serve a lot of very small communities, and (laughs) I stood out like a sore thumb. He called me “the bastard English,” but he always did it with a smile on his face. His little house served as a pub for those minded to use it; he didn’t have a license, but if the landlord didn’t mind, who was going to raise a stink about it? I could’ve, I guess, but it would have been a damn stupid thing to do, turn them all against me. He even showed me the still he kept out back, once, and I’m very thankful I was on duty at the time, or I might’ve had to drink some out of politeness.

So I’m driving, heading over towards this break-in over in [Delnessy,] when Constable Carla Ross, my partner, starts telling me to slow down. Now, Ross had known Callum a lot longer than I had, being about ten years my senior on the force, and had a good twenty years experience policing these communities. I dropped speed, and she stared out at one of the crofts next to us, making this little noise of uncertainty. I was just about to speed up again when she gasped, and yelled to stop the car.

There wasn’t really anywhere to park, but the road was wide enough to pass on, and barely saw two cars in an hour, so I just stopped where we were, and we got out. Staring out over the low, stone wall, I could see a figure, stood in the middle of the field. Took me a moment to recognize Callum McKenzie, holding a pitchfork as he looked out over his croft.

But no… the angle was wrong. He – he wasn’t holding his pitchfork, he was just – gripping the handle. And I realized, with a jolt, that the sharp tines were buried in his stomach.

From this angle, I could just about make out the ends of them, protruding from his back. And suddenly everything seemed very still. Ross acted before I did; she vaulted over the wall and started running towards Callum, calling his name, and I followed a second after her. But then he turned, and we both stopped short. I can’t exactly say what it was in his turn that so unsettled me. Maybe it was too violent, too smooth. It seemed like the pitchfork should have flown out of him, but it stayed wedged in place.

Maybe it was something in his eyes, or that smile of his. Or maybe just the sheer amount of blood on him that didn’t seem right for the neat punctures that we’d seen. Then he turned, and began to run towards us at a dead sprint, pushing the handle that protruded from his torso towards us like a battering ram. I called to him to stay still, to wait there, while we got help, but he just. Kept coming.

Then Ross told him to stop, and I could hear in her voice that she was afraid of him. I was, too. As he got closer, I saw him let go of the bloody pitchfork and drop his hands to his sides like claws. Broken glass was pressed into his fingers, glinting red in the morning sun, and I knew with absolute certainty that he intended to kill us.

The moment before he reached us, I grabbed the handle that still stuck from his belly. It was pure instinct, and my hands exploded in sharp pains as splinters from the rough wooden handle dug into my fingers and palm, but Callum McKenzie stopped dead, with a horrible lurch as the metal prongs buried themselves still deeper. Ross stood there, baton in hand, clearly desperate not to use it as Callum swung his glass covered arms at me, trying to slash my face, and coming within an inch or two of doing so, only kept at bay by the distance of the pitchfork’s handle.

I finally got a look at his eyes, expected to see mania, or a glassy stare… but when they met mine, they were clear, and focused. His smile got wider. “Bastard English,” he snarled, and paused a moment, assessing the situation. With a grunt of effort, he pushed himself further onto the tines of the fork, moving slowly, agonizingly up them, desperately trying to make it those last few inches to reach my throat.

Then there was the sound of something tearing, and I think he must have ruptured something, because his legs went out from under him, and where blood had been oozing before, it now began to gush. He choked, as it started to fill his throat, and I tried, I really tried, to reach out and help him, but he still slashed out at me with those mutilated hands. And I couldn’t get close enough.

Then it was quiet. Ross still stood there, baton raised in exactly the same position, seemingly frozen in confusion, and disgust. She looked at me as if I might have any explanation, but what the hell was I supposed to say? We just kept looking at this broken man, her friend, who had literally killed himself attacking us.

I went back to the car to radio for help, but it – it didn’t seem to be working right; all I could hear from it was the – (steadying breath) – faint noise of static, and… what sounded like bagpipes. I walked back over to Ross, who was now crouched over the body of Callum McKenzie. She looked up at me and shook her head slowly. Standing back up, I could see her hand was slick and red. Then she pointed silently over my shoulder.

My breathing was erratic, and I could feel the tell-tale signs of shock beginning to creep into my body, but I forced myself to turn around. All I could see was the white, one-story cottage behind me. But then my eyes fixed on the broken window, and the streaks of blood around the door. I knew what she was thinking, and I just nodded, took out my own baton, and quietly approached the small house.

It was… silent. No sound at all, save the bleating of a sheep in a nearby field. I’ve never quite got the hang of sheep. I know that sounds daft, but… it’s their throats, you see. They’re so like humans, that when they… baa, it doesn’t – it doesn’t sound like a sheep – Does that make sense? It sounds like a person pretending to be a sheep. Sheep don’t kill each other, though. Not like this.

Anyway, the sound didn’t exactly do anything to put me at my ease. When we entered the house, I instinctively reached out for a light switch, but couldn’t find one. A-a lot of these old crofter places don’t have any electricity, or at least not mains power. It didn’t matter, though. There were plenty of windows to light up the scene in front of us.

The fireplace had long since burned out, but the rocking chair next to it was still occupied. An elderly woman sat there, a blanket over her legs, and a cross-stitch frame in her lap. If it wasn’t for the cook’s knife that pinned her to the chair through the throat, I’d have almost called her serene. Her feet didn’t quite touch the floor, so the draft from the open door rocked her back and forth, back and forth.

On the floor in front of her, two corpses, middle-aged, with rough, weathered faces, were entwined together in an embrace that almost looked affectionate. Until you saw the blood staining their teeth and hands, or the ear still clenched in the younger man’s smile, fresh torn from the other’s head. They had each had their own throats cut, crudely, and plastered across their faces was a smile that seemed to occupy a frozen space halfway between ecstasy and an all-consuming anger. Neither of them had any fingers left at all.

Their murderer was in the kitchen, head forced into an oven, now cold, and burned beyond recognition. The bloody vegetable knife was limp in her hand, and the glass embedded in the back of her neck placed her death firmly at the feet of Callum McKenzie. At this, Ross let out a small cry, and left the room to be sick.

I was feeling completely numb by now, and felt nothing but a dull fascination when I saw the circle pattern of cuts on the dead woman’s arm. The angles made it almost certainly self-inflicted, and it gave the impression the skin was a simple tug from coming away like a peeled potato.

The back door was kicked in, and I could see a small lump of pink flesh just beyond it. And then another. The ground was disturbed as if by a struggle, and I suddenly realized what had happened. Ross had returned by now, shaking and pale, but just as quiet as I was, and together we followed a trail of bitten-off fingers like breadcrumbs taking us home. Home, in this case, was the lawn just outside the cottage of Angus Stewart, an acre or so of land he kept clear for meetings or parties or… whatever other events the tiny community might find they needed space for. Yesterday, it had been the parking of a small sky-blue transit van.

I recognized it of course. It belonged to a young lady from Inverness – I never got her name – who ran a small, mobile lending library that traveled around the villages and crofts of the highlands. Now, she lay at the center of… absolute carnage. Eventually it would be conclusively established that all sixteen other residents of Lancraig were there, though to simply look at the scene it was impossible to tell mud from blood from flesh from bone, and I thank god every day that not one resident of that poor, doomed place had children.

The head of Angus Stewart leered up at me from the ground, lips parted in that same expression of fury and joy, cheeks latticed with steel sheep wire. A sudden thought struck me, that, since our struggle on arriving with Callum McKenzie, neither myself nor Constable Ross had made any noise at all. If there were survivors, they had no way to know it was safe.

Abruptly, I shouted, calling for anyone who might still be alive, telling them they could come out. I tried to ignore the edge of panic in my voice, but my only answer was the mocking bleating of sheep, and those impossibly distant pipes. Ross glared at me, clearly startled by my shouting, and stepped gingerly through the dirt and viscera towards the center. Neither of us could pretend we cared about preserving evidence at that point. These people, good people, had slaughtered each other for no reason at all, and there was nothing we could do to change that fact.

I don’t know exactly how the woman who ran the library van died – at a certain point the injuries sort of all seemed to… bleed together, if you’ll excuse the expression. All I could see for certain is that she held a book in her hands. It was a paperback, old and unloved, with obvious signs of wear long before it found itself in this chaos. The cover and title were unrecognizable, now far too soaked in blood, but it was clear that at some point while holding it, the woman had torn it clean in two down the spine, and now held half in each of what was left of her hands. Ross told me later that she’d gotten a good look at the pages, and that every single one of them was blank.

That was when our backup arrived. It looked like whatever strangeness had affected the radio had been only on our side, and my frantic messages had reached the station loud and clear. It was a whole mess, for a long time – you might have read about it in some of the papers; I think the official report covered it as a ‘drunken brawl that got out of hand.’ It wasn’t, obviously, and no one who was actually there signed the report, but almost everyone who actually dealt with the scene got signed off several weeks with stress, so… didn’t get to have much say in the matter.

There really didn’t need to be any proper cover-up. It was an isolated place, and the folk who had still been living there were on the older side, with little real connection to the outside world. I guess the media doesn’t really care about crofters, especially once the police had swept up the more gory details.

I moved back to Macclesfield shortly afterwards. It pretty much ended my marriage, since my wife was why I’d moved up to Inverness in the first place. (shaky breath) But I just couldn’t go on up there. I can’t stand the sound of bagpipes, and sometimes, at night, I still hear sheep in the distance.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends. Hm. An Englishman returning from Scotland with a fear of bagpipes and sheep. I’m sure we can all relate. (hm) In many ways the Slaughter fascinates me. There seems to be, in all cases, a question at its heart about control. Is it a mindless dance, dragging participants along by the beat of a drum, or is there a kernel of will in there, lucidity and deliberateness to the random fury and violence? I suppose that’s the question with so much of violence, war. How much are you really in command of yourself, or others?

I’m not sure what scares me more: the idea that deep down, everyone is in complete control of their actions, that everything is, on some level, intentional; or that ultimately we don’t have any control of ourselves at all, and the rest is just… rationalization. (shaky breath)

Another Leitner, obviously. Not one I can readily identify, though it sounds like it would now be… inert, anyway. Given the blank pages, I do wonder whether its destruction was a last-ditch effort to stop its effects, or the exact thing that released its power in such an… extreme way. Regardless, I’ve hit another research dead-end with this.

It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I finally feel myself; I feel… focused, and ready, and I find myself basically alone. I’m now sure Martin is actually avoiding me. (shaky breath) Basira was right about the Institute being watched, though. In the last week I’ve seen two different people wearing symbols for the People’s Church of the Divine Host, and it’s rare I go anywhere without cobwebs, anymore.

I, uh, find myself keeping my guard up around mannequins, as well, though I’ll admit, that one is more likely to be my own projection. (sigh) But honestly it’s the internal threats I’m worried about. Peter Lukas is just – sitting up there, doing whatever the hell it is he and Elias have planned, and Melanie –

[The Archivist doesn’t notice, but low static begins and immediately begins to increase in volume.]
ARCHIVIST
– still has that bullet pumping violence into her, waiting to turn this place into another Lancraig. I just wish there was – (confused) What? – (continues)

Wait. I d-didn’t – Did I read that somewhere? Or…

(lets out a breath) Well, right, yes. (clears his throat) The bullet didn’t show up on electronic or mechanical scans, but it’s still lodged in her leg, just above the tibia. And it’s been getting slowly infected ever since – I need to find Basira.

No, I mean…

BASIRA
Oh, yeah, the stuff she takes is pretty strong these days. She should be out for a while. (off of Archivist) What, sleep is hard.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
You’ve been staying here too.

BASIRA
Got a camp bed at the other end, near the tunnels. I like to keep an eye on them.

[She starts opening a box.]
BASIRA
Besides, I wanted to give her some space, you know?

[Some packaging crinkles as it’s handled.]
BASIRA
But, yeah, living outside the Institute’s just not safe anymore.

ARCHIVIST
What about Martin?

BASIRA
I think he’s still got a place? He’s not down here, anyway.

ARCHIVIST
Right. (breath) So, how, how does the –

BASIRA
Do you want to get on with this or not?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, right, sorry. You, uh, you managed to get the anesthetic?

BASIRA
Here. The guy said it was a nerve block, should numb pretty much the whole leg.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Right. Was it hard to come by?

BASIRA
(flat) No, I just popped down Superdrug.

(duh) Yes, it was hard to come by.

ARCHIVIST
Do – you couldn’t get any general anesthetic, knock her out fully?

BASIRA
Oh, sure, did your spooky brain tell you the right dosage to not kill her?

ARCHIVIST
N-no, it didn’t.

BASIRA
Then it’s got to be the local.

Here, get on with it.

ARCHIVIST
What, me?

BASIRA
Yeah. She comes around, she’s going to kill someone, and, you know, not it.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Fine, give it here.

[He opens the box.]
BASIRA
The guy said you’d need to hit the right nerve for it to work. Do you know much about –

ARCHIVIST
Here.

BASIRA
You sure?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
Okay, go for it.

ARCHIVIST
(steadying breaths) Right.

BASIRA
And pray the injection doesn’t wake her.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, thank you, Basira. You’re sure we shouldn’t just… tell her?

BASIRA
I really don’t know how she’d take it. Not well. If we want to get it out of her, this is it.

ARCHIVIST
…Okay.

[Silence as he steadies himself, then injects her with the anesthetic. A shaky breath of relief as nothing happens.]
ARCHIVIST
Right. How long does it take?

[Ratting as Basira checks the packaging and/or the needle is placed back in its box.]
BASIRA
About half an hour, he said.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
You better be right about this.

ARCHIVIST
I am.

[The Archivist sounds much closer when he speaks. He’s whispering, a bit.]
ARCHIVIST
Right, pass me the scissors.

BASIRA
What? I thought you had the scalpel.

ARCHIVIST
For the trouser leg!

BASIRA
Oh – right.

[She hands him the scissors, and he cuts through the leg of Melanie’s trousers.]
ARCHIVIST
God, look at that.

[That same static from earlier in his office is back, and it again begins to intensify.]
BASIRA
I don’t – It’s a leg.

ARCHIVIST
No, inside.

BASIRA
I don’t know what you’re seeing, John.

ARCHIVIST
It’s – christ, it’s all rotten.

BASIRA
Can you see the bullet?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
You’re ready?

[The Archivist laughs dryly.]
ARCHIVIST
No. You’re sure you don’t have – restraints, or –

BASIRA
You think she’s going to sleep through being tied down? I’ll try and grab her if she wakes, but…

ARCHIVIST
(takes a deep breath) Okay. Here we go.

[One last set of shaky breaths before he begins to cut into Melanie’s leg in the worst form of homemade surgery. We can hear the squelch of the scalpel as it hits flesh, amidst John’s breathing.]
[Then the bullet is removed, and both Basira and Archivist let out relieved sighs. At least, until –]
MELANIE
GET OFF ME! GET OFF OF ME!

[Something slams, most likely Melanie lashing out. The following is chaos, all overlapping and confusion and slams and mishandled medical equipment:]
ARCHIVIST
OH JESUS; Get her, she’s awake –

MELANIE
GET AWAY!

[Melanie pushes something and it crashes on the floor, likely either the scalpel or the scissors.]
ARCHIVIST
[She’s] not supposed to [unintelligible] –

BASIRA
Melanie, it’s okay –

Listen, what the [an–]

Alright, [I’m right] behind you; John, run.

[unintelligible] [let’s] go.

BASIRA
Just go!

ARCHIVIST
[I don’t think she] knows –

MELANIE
I CAN’T FEEL MY LEG; I CAN’T FEEL –

ARCHIVIST
It’s just anesthetic! It’s just –

We have to get out of here now!

(clearing throat) Statement of Debra Madaki regarding an adult art class she took in the spring of 2004, and her interactions with Gabriel, a fellow student. Original statement given 11th October, 2009. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
So, there’s a community center about five minutes walk from my house. Used to be they only ever hired out the hall for… weddings, parties – occasional public events. But about five, six years ago they got a new organizer in – Jenny. Lovely woman. Young. Very keen on making the community center just that – the center of the community. So she put together this huge program of adult education classes.

Mostly just the standard stuff, uh dance, life drawing, yoga, computer skills, but there were a few that were a bit more out there. They had a cheese-making course that ended with us all bringing in our somewhat less-than-successful cheeses and pairing them with wines. Still amazing no one got food poisoning from that one. And there was a fire-eating workshop, once. I didn’t go to that one.

Anyway, I’d become great friends with Jenny through the church choir, and since George was off to university and Rosa was generally working evenings, I tended to be alone until about ten or eleven most days. So obviously, I started going to as many classes as I could. It was a great way to… meet friends, uh learn new skills, and, uh, as she always reminded me, spend a good portion of Rosa’s paycheck.

Now about a year after Jenny had taken over, the workshop schedule started listing a biweekly sculpting class. Which was great news, because I’d been telling Rosa just the day before that life drawing and watercolours were all very well, but I really like to get a bit more hands-on with making art. Then Rosa made an off-colour joke about life drawing and getting – hands-on, and I forgot about it, but I still ended up going to the class.

There were only a few of us, learning to sculpt, probably because the class had quite a high materials cost, and was a bit earlier than the others. There was me; Mary, who uh, works in the Post Office; Bill, who I knew from walking his dog; and Ray Quinton, who was actually teaching the class, though I didn’t know him outside of that.

And then there was – him. The man who introduced himself as “Gabriel,” was short and squat, with knobbly bare arms that seemed to reach down almost to his knees. (breath) He had dark hair he claimed he only kept short because he thought no one would notice how greasy it was, and his face jutted out – like it was – trying to escape his skull.

Now, I’m not one to judge on appearances; I was the one who insisted Desmond still come to church after his operation, so please don’t think it was his ugliness that set me against that – horrid little man. There was just something about the way he moved, as if he was always too close, right into your personal space, but then you’d look again, and h-he wasn’t. When he walked up to me without warning and introduced himself, I only just managed to stop myself obviously recoiling. It was just a feeling.

So our first lessons were very basic, all about how to properly move and shape the clay, how to use armatures, and the different tools, and how they interacted with the material. We weren’t really doing much in terms of actual sculpting, just listening and watching Ray do his demonstrations.

At least me, Bill, and Mary were watching him. Gabriel seemed quite content to ignore our teacher entirely, focusing instead on the lump of clay in front of him. His rough, sausage-like fingers twisted and warped it with ease.

I found it a difficult, heavy material to work with, never quite as wet as I needed it to be, no matter how much water I added, but looking over at Gabriel it was like it was alive in his hands, eagerly bending itself into whatever shape he wanted. And those shapes were… odd.

I remember one of our earlier projects was just to do a fish, just a rough shape of a fish, nice and simple. Ray had even pre-made some armatures for us. I mean, I still struggled, and Mary and Bill had a good ol’ go at it, but over in the corner Gabriel just began grabbing and molding and… twisting into a shape that was… well it certainly wasn’t a fish. It sort of – almost started out like a fish. But it just kept going and going, looping back and into itself, as if it was swimming through its own body. After a half hour, I had almost completely forgotten my own work, instead just staring at this serpentine structure that the dreadful man was building.

The most infuriating part was that whenever Ray would pass his table, he’d just nod, gently to himself, and trade a few words with Gabriel as if whatever it was he was trying to make was in any way similar to the practice we’d been assigned.

I know, it was an amateur class, and he was under no obligation to do exactly the work as instructed, but Ray was very clear with the rest of us that we were doing things in a specific order for a reason, and it was just a bit frustrating to see him nodding along to that awful man flagrantly disregarding what we were meant to be doing.

At one point, Gabriel must have noticed me staring. He looked back at me for the longest time, far longer than I was comfortable with, and then he picked up his nasty spiraling clay fish and walked over towards me. I could feel my hairs standing on end as he got closer, and he held it towards my face. He asked me if I could help him, because he was having a bit of a creative block, and I remember thinking – he had the palest eyes I’d ever seen. Then my gaze focused back on the thing in his hands, that dead, curling lump of clay, and I watched it move.

It coiled around, through its own face, and flailed its long, distorted fins in desperate pained movements. It made a noise that sounded like a scream heard through water and stretched out towards my mouth, which I’ll admit was hanging open in horror. If I hadn’t screamed and fallen backwards, I am sure the thing would have dived down my throat.

The others rushed over to me, making all the appropriate noises of surprise and concern, but I could only watch as Gabriel rushed back to his bench and started to furiously work on his sculpture again. He looked over at me, and I heard him speak quite clearly, though no one else reacted to it: “What an excellent idea,” he said. “An excellent direction indeed.”

I quit the class after that. I emailed Ray to explain that I would no longer be attending and left it at that. Obviously, I didn’t tell him exactly what I’d seen, but I thought some general references to inappropriate behaviour from one of the other students would get my point across. And then I continued with my life, and didn’t give Gabriel another thought.

At least, not until I went to my salsa class the following Thursday, and instead found myself walking into a room set up for sculpture. I was obviously taken aback at what had to be a really significant scheduling issue, but having a quick check of the timetable of classes, it looked very much like sculpting had always been on a Thursday, which didn’t make much sense to me, standing there in my dancing shoes and feeling like a fool.

Gabriel gave me a sheepish smile, and returned to – whatever it was he was working on. Ray seemed absolutely delighted to see me, and made such a big show of it that I didn’t really feel like I could just turn around and leave. I asked him if he’d got my email and he nodded emphatically as he ushered me over to my table, but didn’t elaborate.

Bill gave me a slightly pained smile, but when I asked if he was alright, he just shrugged, and told me he couldn’t complain.

There was no sign of Mary. They still haven’t found her.

So I started to work. Ray told us the lesson was ‘faces.’ I put my hand up to say that sculpting faces was probably a bit advanced for where we were in the course, but he shook his head, and said that we were… a lot more talented than we thought. He said the key was that faces were twisted. All faces were twisted on the inside, and all you had to do was reach into the deepest part of yourself and put that twisted on the outside of the clay, and as soon as you can scream you’ll have your own face staring back at you.

I asked him to clarify, and he nodded again. “Soon as you can scream,” he said, glancing over nervously to Gabriel, who gave him… big thumbs up. Like it was all some joke they were playing. It didn’t feel like a joke, let me tell you.

I did my best, prodding and shaping the clay, trying to do a face, a-and I think I actually made a pretty good stab at it, given how unhelpful our instructions had been. I mean it had two eyes, a mouth, something that might – charitably been called hair. I asked Ray for his expertise, but he was just standing at the front of the room, smiling and nodding.

The face Bill was working on looked like Mary, though he’d made her mouth much, much too wide. Be honest, it gave me quite a shock to see. Then I heard that – shuffling sound from the other side of the room, and I knew that Gabriel was walking towards me, no doubt holding some unpleasant new shape he’d formed just for me. He coughed gently, and, well, I suppose it would have been rude not to look.

The structure he held in his hands made my eyes hurt. Thin, sharp lines angling off from each other in an incredibly intricate arrangement, although they never seemed to actually connect with each other. It shifted, just like the other one, and I felt something jabbing at my skull like a migraine. Finally the lines seemed to resolve into a clear shape: A door. “Perfect!” Gabriel told me. “It looks just like him!”

I asked him if it was supposed to be a face and he told me yes. It was a good friend of his. I asked him who and he said they didn’t have a name. I told him everyone has a name, and he said his friend wasn’t like us, that having a name would only confuse them. My head was pounding. I looked over at Ray, still nodding and smiling. And then over at Bill, who was steadily shoveling fistfuls of the clay Mary into his mouth. I don’t remember anything more of that lesson.

The last lesson was on Monday. It wasn’t watercolours, and never had been, according to the schedule I had been obsessively checking so much that Rosa had started to get worried. The room was larger than I’d remembered, although it didn’t need to be, because there weren’t any tables. (at increasing speed) Ray was there at the front, but he was singing something in a high tenor that I couldn’t make out. I tried to ask him what we were doing for the lesson, but he just sang, louder. Bill was there, but he was made of clay his limbs being worked and twisted by Gabriel into strange, spiraling shapes, and occasionally joined into new and impossible positions.

As soon as Gabriel spotted me he hopped up and hurried over to me. He grabbed my had in a firm, damp grip, and started to thank me. I was the best assistant he could have asked for, he said. He’d improved so much because of me. As he said this, the structure beneath his face shifted, pushing it further and further from where his skull should have been. And behind his teeth at the edges of his eyes, I saw the dull red of shifting clay. His smile kept getting wider and bending in on itself at the edges, and where his fingers touched the back of my trembling hand, I could feel his spiraling fingerprints start to turn. Round and around.

The marks won’t come off, no matter how hard I scrub.

That was when I ran. I suppose I could have run before then, but I wouldn’t have wanted to seem rude, and it’s not like any of it could have been real, could it. It was just me losing it a bit. It has to have been, I mean I’ve seen Ray and Bill around since.

Certainly they don’t like to make eye contact, and Bill cries a lot in church, but – they’re still here. They’re fine. So it didn’t happen. There’s no reason for me to stay away from the community center. There’s no reason for me to sit inside all evening, trying not to look to closely at any of the doors.

I got a letter, a week ago. It was from Gabriel. It said that he had found a new job, and he’d love it if I came up to assist him again. He’s working in a place called Sannikov Land. I looked it up. It doesn’t exist. And it sounds cold. I don’t think I should go. I’m not going to go.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

(sigh) ‘The-Worker-In-Clay.’ That’s what Michael called him in his statement. A Great Twisting, that Gertrude stopped at the cost of a single life. (hm) I thought moving away from my humanity would have made that seem more acceptable. That sort of sacrifice… But it just makes me sad. I remembered Gertrude’s notebook. We found it alongside the plastic explosives, but it rather got lost amongst the business of… (sigh) saving the world at the cost of two lives.

It – it’s borderline incomprehensible. Not because of any code, or cipher; there’s every chance I could read those. Just simply because most of it is numbers or fragments of sentences that would no doubt mean something to her, but, well, not to me.

I’ve been staring at it for hours, in the hopes something from it would just – come to me. And it worked well enough to point me towards this statement, which is… useful background, and perhaps gives some insight into how Gertrude formulated her counter-rituals, but – not much more.

I’ve been trying to check on Melanie’s condition. She refuses to see me – understandably, I,I suppose, and Basira has been looking after her. (sigh) It hurts, of course. But… (sigh) I really hope getting that bullet out of her helps. At least stops it from getting any worse. I can’t have been too late again.

[Silence.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
(dry hm) There was a tape recorder waiting for me when I sat down. They’re not even hiding it anymore. There weren’t any tapes from when I was – away. I checked. (long breath) Whatever they are, they are here for me. I suppose I should be worried, but I have so much to keep watch over. So I’ve decided to let the tapes run. They’ve – proved useful before, so… (pause)

I did do a small bit of follow-up on Debra Madaki. Just for my own curiosity. She didn’t go to Sannikov Land in the end. I don’t know, however, whether that was because she decided not to… or because shortly after this statement was given, they found the body of one Mary Randall in her basement, and she has spent the last nine years in Eastwood Park prison, where she remains to this day.

I can’t find any – evidence related to the condition of the body. But I can imagine what a sculptor’s apprentice might be capable of. Even an unwilling one.

MARTIN
(clicking something) Oh. Hello. Haven’t seen you in a while.

[He continues with his work for a bit, before stopping again:]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Really? I mean, it’s just admin. I-it’s not exactly thrilling listening.

[We hear a clock ticking steadily in the background.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
(back to work; more clicking) Alright, fine. Whatever; you do you. Spool away, I guess. (little laugh) Let me know if you need some more batteries or something.

(short sigh, more typing) It’s because he’s back, isn’t it. (click) He’s back, so now you’re going to be – around, again. Listening in. (click, double-click) (amused *hm*) You missed him, didn’t you? (same little laugh) Yeah. Yeah, me too.

[At these last words, we hear the trademark static of Peter Lukas appear and steadily increase in volume.]
PETER
Which isn’t a great sign, if I’m being completely honest.

[At the sound of his voice, Martin startles, then sighs once he’s realized who it is.]
PETER (CONT’D)
You talked to him?

MARTIN
I – I tried not to; I-I-I didn’t mean to –

PETER
(I’m not mad I’m just disappointed) You talked to him. And that’s understandable, Martin, of course it is; please don’t think I’m upset; it’s just – not ideal. Shows how much work we still have ahead of us.

MARTIN
If I keep avoiding him, people will get suspicious.

PETER
(laughing) They’re already suspicious, Martin. And that’s not the problem. I had – hoped that all this time apart would have given you the space you needed, but…

MARTIN
You said he’d probably never wake up.

PETER
And he beat the odds. Which is good! But it does make things more complicated. It doesn’t actually change, anything.

MARTIN
(indignant) A-a simple ‘hello’ isn’t going to make any difference to –

PETER
We’ve been over this. The sort of power you’re going to need relies on your –

MARTIN
(bitter) Obedience.

PETER
Isolation. It needs to be you, Martin. You’re the only one who could possibly balance between the two.

MARTIN
But if I could just explain –

PETER
And how do you think John’s going to react to that explanation, hm? You think he’ll accept it calmly? Come through with a well-considered, rational response?

MARTIN
That’s not fair.

PETER
Or would he assume he knows better than you and do something rash?

[The clocks ticks on in the background of the ensuing pause.]
MARTIN
I don’t like being manipulated.

PETER
That’s fair. But I’m not wrong.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
No.

PETER
Martin. This isn’t how any of us wanted it to go. But here we are, and if we don’t pull this off, it’s over for everyone. John included.

MARTIN
Yeah – you’ve said. (sigh)

MARTIN (CONT’D)
But if things are really so urgent, then why didn’t Elias say anything.

[Peter chuckles, but it’s got an edge to it.]
PETER
Because behind all his bluster, Elias is just like all the rest. He’s so preoccupied playing the game, he doesn’t pay attention to the big picture. He managed to convince himself that he could get his ritual off first, which would have made all of this a bit – moot, but that’s not really an option anymore. So it’s down to us. You and me, the dynamic duo!

MARTIN
And so, what, that means I have to trust you?

PETER
It would make things a lot simpler.

MARTIN
Yeah, well, things would also be a lot simpler if you weren’t so cryptic about everything!

PETER
Well, if your Archives were a bit better-organized, it wouldn’t have taken me almost three months to find the evidence you needed.

MARTIN
What?

PETER
I’m just saying that we’d all be better off if your Archivist actually knew how to archive.

MARTIN
(enough) Peter.

[Pause.]
PETER
…Yes. Well. (pause)

PETER (CONT’D)
Unless I’m mistaken, I believe I’ve unearthed a few of Dekker’s old statements. Of course, I still need to do a bit of verification, but I’m confident they should provide you with all the context you need.

MARTIN
Good.

PETER
Great!

[Pause.]
MARTIN
When all this is over, I’m telling him everything, with or without your permission.

PETER
Martin, when it’s over, you won’t want to.

[Martin lets out a contemplative noise.]
PETER (CONT’D)
But he will be safe. They all will.

MARTIN
Yeah.

[Silence.]
PETER
Anyway, I’m very excited to see this rota you’ve put together.

MARTIN
(overlapping) Oh – oh, okay.

PETER
Never had much of a gift for administration myself – too many variables. Now, this box on the left, that’s the library stuff, yes?

MARTIN
Wh– n,no! That’s the – Those are the dates! I – (clicking) Look, are you sure you don’t want me to teach you; i-it’s a very simple program –

PETER
No, no. Can’t stand computers. Besides, that’s why I have an assistant, isn’t it?

MARTIN
(sighing) Yeah. I guess so.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of Dr. Jonathan Fanshawe regarding the months leading up to the death and autopsy of Albrecht von Closen. Original statement given as part of a letter to Jonah Magnus, November 21st, 1831. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Jonah. I must first and foremost decline your generous offer of a medical position servicing Millbank Penitentiary. While the terms you have laid out are, no doubt, more than adequate, I have for these last months come to the unfortunate conclusion that our intimacy and friendship must cease immediately. I do not know what interest you have in the poor condemned souls within those walls, nor do I care to guess. In the light of what I have so recently witnessed, I can no longer in good conscience associate with any of your endeavors. Nor will I continue to collect or provide those accounts of the esoteric and otherworldly that you and your… Institute so eagerly require. Consider this the severing of our acquaintance.

This cannot come as a shock to you. Surely you must have understood what you were asking when you implored me to visit with Albrecht, and apply my meager skills to the illness that beset him. You must have known the nature of that illness, even if only in the most general terms, and no doubt you had some intuition as to its cause.

But, should all this be a true surprise to you, then I shall do my best to explain, and hope that any revelations contained here in me sway you from the path you have started upon.

I arrived at Albrecht’s estate early in April. The trees were dense with renewed greenery, and the rain drummed heavily on the carriages as we approached. I remember it so clearly. The smell of the rain cut through with an unexpected whiff of smoke, and as we got closer I saw the orange glow of flame through the trees.

My first thought was that the house had caught fire, and I would arrive only to a scorched ruin and blackened bone, but as we got closer I could see that it was a single tree that was burning. A gnarled and ancient elm, that sat removed from the rest of the forest. A small crowd surrounded the spectacle. One man, who I took to be a groundskeeper, stood closer than the others, with a lit torch in his hand.

On my instruction, the driver pulled closer, though the horses were nervous, and I asked the man why they were burning the tree, when the rain was coming down so heavily. Surely it could have waited for drier weather. The man simply shrugged. My German is… fine, though I have had little cause to use it of late, but his accent was thick, and all that I could get from him was a sense of… resignation, and the insistence that his master, who I took to be Albrecht, wanted the tree dead. I’m sure that he used that word, though. Not burned, not removed, or destroyed. Dead. I resolved to ask Albrecht about it when I saw him.

As it transpired, that was sometime later than I had anticipated. As I’m sure you’re aware, Albrecht’s wife Carla was taken by a fever some years ago, and his sons were away at school, so it was the housekeeper who greeted me when I arrived. Greta, her name was, a pleasant, red-faced young woman with a smattering of English that she insisted on using at every opportunity.

Once I had dressed in dry clothes, she brought some food and a drop of brandy, all the while making apologies that the master of the house was indisposed. I did tell her that I was a doctor, and specifically visiting in order to help end any indisposition. But she just shook her head and told me he’d see me when he was ready.

The house seemed.. so empty. The rain battered on the window, and the clocks ticked away in every room, but there seemed no sound of life to be found anywhere. As I sat in the drawing room, I realized Greta had left the door behind me open to the corridor beyond. I tried to ignore it, simply drink my brandy and continue waiting.

But I could not ignore the sensation that someone was out there, watching behind me. The corridor was dark, and I thought for a second I could make out a shape, crouched there. But there was nothing, so I closed the door. Eventually evening came, and Greta informed me that dinner was served. I ate alone, sat in a long dining hall that seemed to have far too many windows. Turning behind me, I saw Greta watching me from the doorway. Her face held nothing of malice in it that I could discern, but still I was uneasy. I called, trying to dismiss her, but she didn’t seem to hear me.

I retired back to the drawing room to smoke my pipe, but even that simple, reassuring action brought me no comfort, and I made my way to the room I had been given without ever once having seen my elusive host. I noted that the window looking over my bed had neither blind nor shutter, and I was all at once very aware of my candle, and the sickly illumination it spread over everything, the point of light reflected back in the glass like the glint of an eye.

I did not sleep well that night. The feeling of being under-observation did not lessen, and I remained unsure of the exact nature of this errand, an errand, I remind you, Jonah, I undertook at your insistence. Eventually a fitful sleep found me, and I had some measure of peace.

It was still dark when I awoke, and that feeling had intensified to a terrifying measure. I was now certain that something was in the room with me, staring at me. I reached over and took a match, striking it against the bedpost. And there, looming over me, was a face, pale and shaking. The eyes sunken, and the cheeks were dirty and unshaved.

It was the face of Albrecht von Closen.

In the light, his eyes met mine, and his mouth began to work furiously, repeating the same phrase over and over, increasing in volume until he was screaming it into my face: (breath)

“Leg sie alle zurück. Leg sie alle zurück.”

Put them back. Put them back.

I felt a sharp pain in my fingers as the match burned down, and I dropped it with a cry. The room disappeared into darkness once again, and when my scrabbling hands had gotten another lit, he was gone. And I was alone. I did not sleep any further that night.

When the sun finally crept through my uncovered window, I dressed quickly. Greta’s pleas that I come down for breakfast were roundly ignored, and I started throwing open any door I had not yet seen behind, looking for my host.

I found him in the library, where a fire already blazed in a feeble attempt to keep the morning chill at bay. He stood in front of it, eyes lost in the flame, looking every bit as feeble and warm as he had when he crouched over my bed the night before. I shut the door behind me before Greta could object, and demanded to know why he had come into my room.

He… apologized, in such a pitiful tone that the anger seemed to abandon me all at once. He seemed so small. He gestured for me to take a seat, and I did. As he walked the shelves, stroking the spines of each book in turn, I started to ask him about his health, and explained why I was there, but he showed not the slightest sign that he was listening.

“I had them rebound last year,” he said. “Damp can do terrible things to a book.” I told him I was certain that that was the case, but I must insist we talk about his health. Again he ignored me. Instead, he took the seat opposite me and started to tell me a story. And then another. And another. A stream of strange tales began to pour out of him, and I just sat there, transfixed, desperately wishing I had the strength of will to leave, but all I could do was listen.

He told me of a seamstress, who laced her body with fine black thread, and when she pulled it all out in a single swift motion, her skin dropped away like a loose shift. He told me of a man so scared to die he spent a year weaving a rope blindfolded, so he would not know the length, and could not foresee the moment it would tighten around his neck when he finally threw himself into the void. He told me of a fire that burns so hot and fierce that to even know about it is enough to burn a man’s tongue from his head. He told me so many terrible things.

And at the end of it all, the only thing I could think to ask him was where he read them. My eyes darted to the books that surrounded us, but Albrecht laughed at this, and placed his hands across a spine that was simply labeled ‘A Warning.’ For a moment, he looked as though he were about to wrench it from its place and hurl it into the fire. But it passed. He turned back to me. “You do not understand,” he said to me in German. “I do not read the books. They read me.”

I did not ask him to clarify further. I got the key to my room from Greta and made sure this time, the door was locked as I slept.

As my stay progressed, I learned more of his condition. I would have initially described it as a… natural mania, that had found a totemic focus on the books of his library. But when he finally told me the story of how he discovered them… and the awful tomb from which they were retrieved, I began to suspect that perhaps the books had brought some contaminant into Albrecht’s home, which had gradually corroded his mind. I had neither the time nor equipment to conduct the sort of tests that might have confirmed such things, but I became convinced that removing the books would go some way to addressing his health concerns.

I expected some stiff resistance on the subject, but Albrecht’s response seemed closer to relief than any sort of distress. He simply asked if I would help, and, to my eternal regret, I agreed.

What shall I tell you, Jonah, about this… fool’s errand? That damnable journey we embarked upon? Shall I regale you with the awful experiences of transporting a library’s worth of books through the Black Forest? Perhaps I should write you an account of finding that ancient cemetery, of descending into that bleak and frozen mausoleum. Or would you prefer to hear about the hours we spent placing volume after volume on empty grey shelves, ignoring how out of place the new bindings appeared against the antique stonework?

No. I’m sure all you want to know was how Albrecht died. Why it was that, as I replaced the last book taken from that place, I heard his – scream from the top of the stairs and ran up to find him sprawled and dead before the stone coffin. But I cannot answer that. I do not know how he died. I saw nothing and no one with him, and his body seemed whole and undamaged. But I do have some idea as to why it happened.

For as I filled those dead shelves with freshly bound volumes, I could not help but notice that every page was blank. I have since checked with [Paines], who I believe to be your preferred book-binders. And I know that the books poor Albrecht was returning to the grave were not the books that were taken. I hope they bring you much wisdom, Jonah, for the cost was dear enough.

Nothing stood in the way of my retreat, and I dragged Albrecht’s body back as far as the coach. We left that awful place, and I have endeavored most acutely to forget the route.

Before he was buried, I was able to secure permission to do an autopsy. I had some thought as to discovering the cause of his sudden, violent passing. Do I need to tell you what I found, Jonah? Do I need to detail what covered his organs, his bones, the inside of his skin? What clustered together in their dozens, and all turned as one to focus on me as I opened his chest, their pupils constricting in the light, with irises of every hue and color? Because whatever it was that did this to him, I know in my heart that it is your fault.

I have had the body burned. Please do not write to me again.

Your obedient servant,

Doctor Jonathan Fanshawe.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

(sigh) Disconcerting to find my namesake in a statement, especially one connected so directly to the Institute. I can only hope breaking faith with Jonah Magnus didn’t go too badly for him.

Hm. Jonah Magnus. I’ve never really given much thought to him, not nearly as much as I should have. I suppose I had always hoped there was a chance he was… innocent in all this. I know, I know. But I had – (sigh) I just – hoped that maybe the founding of the Institute was in earnest, and not simply the foundation-stone for all the terrible things that have happened here. But no. Whatever is happening now has its origins two hundred years ago, in the work of an evil man. (shaky breath)

Exactly two hundred years in fact. Don’t think that little detail has evaded me. I don’t know the precise date the Institute was founded, but I do know that it was in 1818. (shaky breath) Something’s coming. I know it is. (pause) But I just – don’t know what I need to do.

(sound of recognition) (calling)

Come in, Basira.

[The door opens and closes as Basira comes in.]
BASIRA
I was waiting for you to finish.

ARCHIVIST
I know.

BASIRA
I don’t like that you’ve started doing that.

ARCHIVIST
I – I know. (pause, sigh) How’s Melanie?

BASIRA
How do you think?

ARCHIVIST
Ah – I-I, uh, I should probably talk to –

BASIRA
(overlapping) You should probably stay as far away as possible. She doesn’t want to see you.

ARCHIVIST
No. No, o-o-o-of course.

BASIRA
But, she did want me to… apologize.

ARCHIVIST
(soft, surprised) Oh.

BASIRA
From her, for… the shoulder.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. It, it’s fine. Scalpel wounds – (nonchalant laugh) – they heal quickly.

BASIRA
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
(dry breath of a laugh) Too quickly, really.

[He gives another of those same laughs.]
BASIRA
Already?

ARCHIVIST
(long sigh) Just another scar for the collection.

BASIRA
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
D-Do you think it worked; is she…?

BASIRA
I don’t know. She seems more… coherent, I guess? And you did get an apology.

ARCHIVIST
(quiet) Yeah.

BASIRA
She says she can cry now, which is, um –

ARCHIVIST
(even quieter) Oh.

BASIRA
– progress? I think?

ARCHIVIST
Uh –

BASIRA
She’s still angry, but she hasn’t attacked anyone. Not even sure she has it in her anymore.

ARCHIVIST
Well that’s – that’s good.

BASIRA
(ehhhh) Mm.

[The Archivist sighs.]
BASIRA
So. You can’t be killed by a collapsing building. Major injuries scar fast. You can force the truth out of people, and knowledge pops into your head whenever you need it.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I, I think that, that about covers it.

BASIRA
…And what was that you were doing yesterday?

ARCHIVIST
…When?

BASIRA
You were sat on the floor for like four hours.

ARCHIVIST
…Oh! Uh, no, I,I,I was – I was – listening, you know, trying to see if the statements (inhale) …called to me.

BASIRA
And?

[We hear the flip of pages as the Archivist indicates the Fanshawe statement.]
BASIRA
Brilliant.

[The Archivist puts the statement down; we note at this point that there is some static that has just come in.]
ARCHIVIST
Look, I don’t know, Basira. I hope I’m still human, but it – (sigh) But it’s seeming more and more unlikely.

BASIRA
I didn’t ask.

ARCHIVIST
No, I suppose you didn’t.

BASIRA
Don’t snoop in my head.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not snooping; I’m not looking; that’s not how this works!

BASIRA
Explain it, then.

ARCHIVIST
I,I’m not sure I can!

BASIRA
Humor me.

[The Archivist lets out a long sigh.]
ARCHIVIST
It’s – hard. It’s like there’s a, a door, in my mind. A-a-and behind it is, is the entire ocean.

ARCHIVIST
Before, I didn’t notice it, but now, I – I know it’s there, and I can’t forget it, and I can feel the pressure of the water on it. I – I – [unintelligible noise] – I can keep it closed? (sigh) But sometimes, when I’m around p-people, or.. places, or.. ideas? A drop or two will push through the cracks at the edges of the door. And I’ll… know something.

[Pause.]
BASIRA
What happens if you open the door?

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
I drown.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry, Basira, I,I will try to keep anything I’ve learned about you to myself. And my priorities haven’t changed. I hope you can believe that. (shaky breath and sigh) I’m still on your side. You can trust me.

BASIRA
(tired exhale) Yeah. People keep saying that.

ARCHIVIST
Do they? Who – who – who else – did Martin say something?

BASIRA
(brief pause) It was a few months back, after the attack. He’d started spending time with Lukas.

[The Archivist sighs.]
BASIRA
At least, he said he was. And I wanted answers.

BASIRA
He kept telling me to trust him, to hear the guy out, even though he still wouldn’t actually show his face. I told him he could drop me an email or vanish me.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
Honestly, I kind of regret not just – grabbing Martin and shaking an explanation out of him. But I didn’t want to push it. He was in a – bad place, what with the attack and his mum and everything. Now I try and bring it up and he just – disappears. Nothing to be done.

ARCHIVIST
S-sorry, you said – what happened with his mother?

BASIRA
Oh, yeah. She died. About two months after you, uh…

ARCHIVIST
(in the background, quiet) Oh.

BASIRA
(pause) Martin was… He tried to stay strong, keep it together, but – that sort of thing… (sigh) Then those Flesh things burst in, and well – here we are.

ARCHIVIST
God.

BASIRA
He didn’t tell you?

ARCHIVIST
(surprised) No.

BASIRA
Hm. Guess you don’t know everything then.

ARCHIVIST
N-no, I,I guess not. (shaky breath and sigh) So what do we do now?

BASIRA
You tell me. Just don’t expect much on trust these days.

ARCHIVIST
(hm) Yes, I, I suppose that’s fair.

[We hear the sound of a door or two being unlocked, and then locked again. There’s a bit of echoing background chatter.]
ELIAS
Good evening, Detective.

[Basira walks up to him.]
BASIRA
I’m not a detective.

ELIAS
Of course.

BASIRA
You wanted to see me?

ELIAS
Yes.

BASIRA
Something too important to tell the Inspector?

ELIAS
Maybe I – just wanted to have a chat.

BASIRA
Well, good luck with that.

[She starts walking back, begins to unlock what sounds like a grated door.]
ELIAS
I – found one of these in my cell.

[Basira pauses.]
ELIAS
(continuous) It wasn’t recording, but I assume this means he’s awake.

[Elias’s handcuffs clink.]
ELIAS
Basira?

[Clink again.]
BASIRA
Can we cut the bullshit?

ELIAS
What “bullshit” might that be?

BASIRA
The part where you pretend you don’t spend your whole time watching us.

[Someone yells something in the background.]
ELIAS
Sometimes I’m eating.

BASIRA
You know he’s back. You’ve seen him.

ELIAS
Fine. Yes.

[Another clink.]
[Pause.]
BASIRA
So what’s with the recorder? Who gave it to you?

ELIAS
(handcuffs clink again, nonchalant) Oh, no. That – that really did just appear in my cell.

BASIRA
Right, so, what, you figured you could just record us for him? Serve some distrust from afar?

ELIAS
Our arrangement with the inspector notwithstanding, I rather feel that right now all the distrust is very much your own. And, as to whether he’ll ever hear this, maybe he’ll get the tapes, maybe he won’t, but the recordings have helped so far, so…

BASIRA
Do you know what they are?

ELIAS
What a question.

[Basira sighs.]
BASIRA
Fine. So you won’t see him, but you’re happy for him to hear our conversations.

ELIAS
He can listen all he wants, but he’s at a very delicate stage right now, and I fear my presence would be a, um, a distraction.

[Clink.]
ELIAS
I made it clear my cooperation is contingent on his not seeing me, and my terms have been accepted thus far.

BASIRA
So why am I here? What do you want that’s so important you needed to tell me to my face?

ELIAS
I believe you recently lost Melanie.

BASIRA
We saved Melanie.

ELIAS
As a person, yes, but as a defender… (he tsk-sighs) I would have thought you would want all the help you could get, or have you forgotten what happened the last time you let your guard down?

BASIRA
We’ll work it out.

ELIAS
(heh) Possibly. Then again, you are beset by enemies on all sides, Basira. And, unless you expect John to record them into submission, it would seem you are in rather dire need of another option.

BASIRA
And you just happen to have one.

ELIAS
I might have an idea, (clink) yes.

BASIRA
And what does it cost?

ELIAS
Just some of your time, Basira. Just your time.

[Pause.]
BASIRA
(letting out a long sigh) Okay. Let’s hear it.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Some papers rustle.]
BREEKON
(low, dark) Don’t say a word.

[More rustling. The door opens, and the Archivist comes in.]
BASIRA
John. Don’t turn on the light. Go get Melanie, quickly.

ARCHIVIST
It’s alright, Basira, I know he’s here.

BASIRA
So what are you doing?

ARCHIVIST
I imagine he’s here to deliver something. Thought it might need signing for.

BREEKON
That’s right. Just wanted to – to drop off a package.

BASIRA
Right, look, what the hell is this? Did you bring him here?

ARCHIVIST
No.

BASIRA
Is he here for revenge?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t – I don’t know. Ask him.

BASIRA
Like he’s going to answer me.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. (inhale)

(to Breekon) Are you here for revenge?

[As he asks the question, a static builds in the background; this is compulsion in effect.]
BREEKON
(heh) Yeah. Just like when we.. when I fed the copper to the pit.

[Basira bristles with an incensed breath.]
ARCHIVIST
Easy, Basira.

[The static gets stronger. A low rumbling begins to accompany it.]
ARCHIVIST
What pit.

BREEKON
In here.

[He knocks twice against Breekon and Hope’s trademark coffin.]
BREEKON
Realized I’m not tied – to it anymore. Not on my own. Thought you could have it. Pay your respects like –

BASIRA
Daisy’s in there.

BREEKON
That’s its name? Then sure, ‘t’s in there, whatever’s left. Find out if you like.

ARCHIVIST
Would you please drop that ridiculous voice?

BREEKON
(terrible Russian accent) Apologies. Is preferred like so?

ARCHIVIST
Christ, that’s worse.

[Breekon laughs, still in the “accent.”]
ARCHIVIST
(with compulsion) What is your real voice?

[Breekon laughs again, back to the original voice, though not as darkly intoned.]
BREEKON
Nikola said you were funny. Didn’t believe it.

BASIRA
What do you want? Why are you here?

[Silence. The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
(with compulsion) Why are you here?

BREEKON
Dunno.

(pause) ‘S not right, on my own. Not right. No point in doing it on my own. Don’t know what happens now. (pause) Thought I might kill you. Missed my chance. Thought I might just deliver something. So here’s a coffin.

[He slides the coffin closer.]
In case you want – to join your friend.

[Basira takes a breath.]
BASIRA
Get out.

ARCHIVIST
Basira.

[Static is building in the background; there’s a strange rustling sort of sound.]
BASIRA
Get. Out.

BREEKON
Make me.

[And all at once there’s a strange sound, musical yet hollow, and it seems to be building to –]
ARCHIVIST
Stop.

[There’s a new static layered on top, now, high-pitched – like feedback from microphones too close to each other, but angelic, somehow.]
BREEKON
What’re you doing?

[No answer. The strange new static combination continues; whatever’s happening, we have no clues as to its nature.]
BASIRA
John, what are you doing?

BREEKON
What are you – stop it.

[The static becomes more intense.]
BREEKON
Stop it!

[When the Archivist speaks, it has an echo to it, reminiscent of the hollowness from earlier:]
ARCHIVIST
No.

[He says nothing further, but Breekon begins to make an uncomfortable, almost choking sound.]
BREEKON
E-Enough – stop – looking at me –

[The static – from rumbling to regular static to feedback – grows even stronger. Breekon makes more gurgling/choking sounds, and then begins to yell, but almost immediately after he begins, his voice begins to fade. His scream is still clearly at high intensity; it’s more as if someone took the knob controlling his volume and turned it down mid-yell.]
[Something makes a knocking or banging sort of sound as this happens; it’s possible that Breekon has been pushed out the door.]
[The static continues, and then the Archivist lets out a soft gasp and begins breathing hard, as if needing air.]
[He takes one final, steadying breath, after which the static begins to fade.]
BASIRA
John?

ARCHIVIST
(quickly) It’s fine. (more himself) Get me a pen. Please.

ARCHIVIST
(clearing his throat) Mm – Statement of the surviving half of the being calling itself ‘Breekon and Hope’ regarding its… existence. Statement… extracted from subject, 3rd March, 2018. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
We started in a plague. Not like the nasty crawlers, but like bringing any other doom. We had a cart of corpses, faces twisted, screaming, leaking pus. Knock on doors and cry roughly to bring their dead to us. I tended the shrunken, mangy mule, and he took the remains on shoulder, slinging them onto the stinking pile.

I remember it clear. The fear on their faces as we rolled towards their hovels. Mud-caked peasant or bloated lord, every one of them saw us coming and trembled. It wasn’t the plague they feared; it wasn’t the death that waited in our wagon. It was us. Two strangers rolling towards them, unstoppable and uncertain, wearing faces they would only half-remember, bringing a fate they would beg their god to forget. They could not hate us, anymore than they could hate the rock that falls on them from a crumbling cliff. They did not know us, but they knew what we might do to them. What we might bring them.

And we did. Villages that might have no bodies for us when we arrived would pile high our cart before we left. We did not kill them, did not lift a finger. We were the bringers of their awful fate, not its executors. They knew this and feared us in kind. And we drank it down, the taste of it sweeter than the food that now rotted on our plates or the drink that curdled in our cups. And we both tasted it together.

When we left our destination, the mule whining at the new weight behind it, he would reach behind us and find a face, sagging, sloughing off its skull, and pull it to him. He’d place it over the one he wore already and he would laugh and laugh and laugh. Sometimes it fell off. Sometimes it stayed for weeks. I kept the face we chose, but I loved him for our levity. And the corpses piled ever higher.

We served aboard the Robert Small, bodies of the time crammed into uniform as sloppily as anyone would expect. Enlistment wasn’t needed, nor was drafting. We were on the list for any crew that deserved us. And we were fitting deckhands for the Robert Small, as it made its slow and mournful passage to Australia. The quartermaster was too precise, though, and in counting out the rations saw us for what we were. I ate the quartermaster’s pen. He ate the quartermaster’s tongue. And that was that.

The journey was magnificent. No waiting, no searching for a delivery. Every moment moved us towards, towards the completion of the task and the culmination of our charge’s terror. Poor wretches who emerged from Millbank, with tales of Australia and its cruelties on their lips, bundled into the cramped and creaking ship that would drag them away from everything they loved. And towards everything they feared.

That was the first time we saw what would become this place: The Eye’s Pedestal. But we were drunk on the dawning horror of transportation and took no heed of it.

A young man named Jack tried to leap overboard. When he caught the lad, there was such begging and pleading as you’ve never heard, just to let them drown, allow the sea to take its due. But he just laughed and laughed, and Jack died on land as he had always been meant to.

We were conductors on a train, prim suits and scowls, a relentless beast of iron and steam that never seemed to get you exactly where you wanted to be unless there was something dreadful waiting for you. We punched tickets, ignored questions, and threw off those who looked like they were having too fine a time of it. We didn’t like this job, too many sat aboard dreaming sweetly of progress and the future, too few alive to the truth of dirt and struggle in front of them. We woke those we could, but too many stepped off with a smile.

We had some luggage, once, a thrumming silk-wrapped thing of the spider, hiding away in an old steamer trunk. We stepped heavy through the dining car and found an old woman near the caboose. “Something strange in the luggage car,” he said, and I finished as was our way – “You should come and see it.” She stood and walked with us readily enough, though tears flowed silent down her cheeks and pattered onto the fading carpet.

The Spider’s always an easy job, no fuss, no complications, everything planned and prepared. It knows too much to truly be a stranger, but hides its knowing well enough to endure. We knew she wouldn’t scream as she was hollowed out and drunk, but still he thought best to cover the sounds with a laugh. He was always our humor. (pause) I remember our first automobile, black and reliable, just about presentable for the London auction-houses we served. He squeezed its first owner until they stopped, and dumped them in a river, and I stayed with the second until they didn’t know who they were, anymore than they knew what they were.

And then we had a car. It was noisy, and it juddered, but the name on the wooden siding was respectable, and now it was ours and good enough for Sotheby’s. We moved a lot of things in those years. Some of them even harmless. My favorite was the old knife, rusted from the trenches and lied about by a barking auctioneer. We delivered it to a leering banker who knew the second they saw us what they’d done.

Sweat dripped from under their bowler hat as they took the knife from its dented metal case and screamed. They lunged at me, stabbing me over and through, then moved on to him, but he just laughed as the blade went in and out and no blood flowed from the holes they cut. And when the banker had screamed all the curses they had learned from German gas attacks, the knife turned back again and cut them, piece by piece. We delivered it back to Christie’s, and that was the end of the auction jobs.

Then were the good times, the circus times. We always take what jobs are before us, deliver whatever will bring that fear and misery, but there is no joy in carrying meat, in shifting writhing spiral things. But with the circus, we were among our own kind at last. They all had names, true enough, but none would dare pretend that names were real. Faces changed more often than clothes, and nobody truly knew who anybody was, save for their function within the show. We carried and lifted and helped the circus move towards its next destination, the next doomed town. Sometimes we joined the show, lifting weights and things that looked like animals. Sometimes we lifted members of the audience. Sometimes we even put them down again.

Even in our stillness, people were afraid. The winter in Russia was cold, and in the icy air, the absence of our breath was clear for all to see. I could taste their discomfort. But none ever mentioned it. We didn’t like the puppet, when Orsinov began to carve it. It seemed wrong to us to try and bring one like us about, to create or remake it in such a solid, static shape.

We were wrong, of course, and when Orsinov carved into the thing that had once called itself Grimaldi, and fed the pieces they didn’t need to the shuddering organist, even we found ourselves impressed. And when the faceless puppet peeled its creator and moved itself with their tendon strings, he looked at me and laughed and laughed.

We followed her a while, but she was unpredictable, while we are things of point and purpose. When she lost the ancient skin, we went our separate ways, and found ourselves a lorry, long and dirty-grey. We drove the motorways and country roads, and took great crates of nothing to and fro, driving towards a different sort of terror. It wasn’t our cargo that brought fear, then. We brought fear to our cargo. Smiling, waiting patiently by the road, with cardboard signs of gentle hopes. In they went to the back, that silent heavy place, with boxes that seemed too big or too warm. They usually screamed as we drove and drove, fear thick in the air, and sometimes they died.

Some tried to leap from the back into the road, and one even made it through. Most stayed, getting weaker and weaker, their cries fading away as hunger and thirst and despair took their final hold. But we were not content. He didn’t laugh like he used to, driving aimless, waiting for the call sat badly with us, who were meant to know our destination. We were meant to have a cargo and an address, so it was we found a man named Breekon, and took everything they were until there was nothing left but the sweet taste of a broken soul’s disquiet and confusion.

We took the van and started to deliver once again. But we were reckless, desperate for the surety we had not felt since leaving the circus. And so we took the casket, a hungry thing of the earth, a crushing, choking tomb that will not let you die because it is too much what it is for death to find you there, within its mocking shape, buried alive.

It was one like us that found it, a thing of shifting names and deja-vu. A fool, that believed because it found the coffin in chains, it would be an easy thing to control, to bargain with. But there was no remorse when the test finally failed, and it fed on the thing that considered itself the master. No face to change in the cold, dark earth, no eye to fool where it is now.

But there was no mention of us in the deal, no thought to what might happen should a victim pass the test. And what happened was: we were stuck with it. It was still our cargo, nowhere to take it, no address or destination. So back in the van it went.

A long time we’ve carried it, keeping it as close as it wants, not listening to it sing in the rain. Even when the mannequin that now called itself Orsinov came back to us, told us we could help the world unknow and fear again the coming of strangers, still we had to drag it with us, an unclaimed package.

But I suppose it was worth it, in the end. When that Hunter killed him, when she took her violence of mindless instinct and unleashed it on us, it was there. It was waiting. I fed her to it. She took him from me, made us a me. And she doesn’t get to die for that. She gets to live, trapped and helpless, and entombed forever. No prey, no hunt. No movement.

We failed, but I have at least that comfort. I am without him now. I am. I can feel myself fading, weak, no reason to move, nothing to deliver. But I am no longer tied to the casket, so you can have it. You can stare at it, knowing how your feral friend suffers, knowing how powerless you are to help. And when you can’t bear it any longer, knowing that you can climb in, and join her. I have never known hate before. I have never known loss. But now they are with me always, and I desire nothing but to share them with you.

BASIRA
Yeah, I can read.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Right.

Short pause.

BASIRA
So why give it to us?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t – I don’t know. T-to taunt us? To (inhale) lure us in as well?

[He sighs.]
BASIRA
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
I-I saw that – thing’s mind; it’s lost on its own, no partner, no – purpose, I-I-I honestly think it just wanted to do another delivery.

BASIRA
And there’s no chance more of the circus survived the explosion?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t think so. I – at least – Breekon didn’t think so.

[He sighs.]
BASIRA
Where does the coffin lead?

ARCHIVIST
The Buried.

BASIRA
Right.

[Silence.]
BASIRA
(inhale, set) Right. Keep it safe; I’ll be gone a few days. I have some leads I need to follow up.

[We hear the rustling of her moving as she’s speaking.]
ARCHIVIST
Sorry?

BASIRA
You heard me. Don’t ask about them. And don’t know about them either.

ARCHIVIST
Well, I can’t exactly control that.

BASIRA
(cutting him off) Learn.

ARCHIVIST
(sighing) I’ll do my best. (breath) You can trust me, Basira.

BASIRA
Stop saying that.

[Silence.]
BASIRA
Do you know how I survived that – the Unknowing?

ARCHIVIST
I… No. No I don’t.

BASIRA
No powers, no… magic or help. I was trapped in that place, and so I tried to figure it out. And I did, a little. So I kept doing it. I kept going through until I got out, I… reasoned my way out of that nightmare.

ARCHIVIST
Good Lord.

BASIRA
Then everything ended and Daisy was gone. And you were gone. And Tim.

And then I got back to the Institute and Martin sent me to meet the new boss. Then I stood alone in an empty office for more than an hour.

I can trust me, John. That’s it.

[The Archivist sighs.]
BASIRA
I’ll try and be back in a week or two. Don’t think about me.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
And don’t open the coffin.

[The Archivist laughs dryly.]
ARCHIVIST
It is addressed to me.

(silence)

(somber) Yes, alright. Alright.

[A light thud, and some shuffling of pages, followed by the creaking of a door; someone is entering the room.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin?

MARTIN
Uh – John – how did you?…

ARCHIVIST
I just, ha– I know sometimes.

It’s, It’s a whole – thing.

[As he speaks, footsteps sound throughout the room.]
MARTIN
Oh. Okay. W-well, sorry, but I, I, um…

ARCHIVIST
You have to leave. Suddenly.

MARTIN
(almost to himself) Oh, (normal) John, come on, we’ve been over this –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) No, it’s fine; I know you’ve got… (big sigh) Whatever this is, I’m not going to question you.

MARTIN
(swallowing) Thank you.

ARCHIVIST
Even if it looks like you’re doing something really stupid.

[Pause.]
[A slight sigh, then:]
ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

MARTIN
It’s okay.

(breath)

I get it; it’s just –

ARCHIVIST
I worry. You’re working for someone (fumbles for words) really bad.

MARTIN
Yes, I’m not an idiot, John, but – it’s no worse than working for something really bad, so.

ARCHIVIST
At least the Eye hasn’t gone after our own.

[Martin sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Lukas has vanished two people –

MARTIN
Yeah, and if it wasn’t for me, it would have been a lot more.

[Pause; Martin moves to leave.]
MARTIN
This isn’t helping anything.

ARCHIVIST
I just – (sigh) I’m sorry; Basira’s off doing – god knows what, and I can’t talk to Melanie.

MARTIN
(yeah, whatever, okay) Mhm.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
I suppo–

(he stops himself)

I miss you.

[Martin lets out a short laugh of disbelief.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m just –

MARTIN
Lonely.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[A sniff.]
ARCHIVIST
I, uh – I heard about your mother.

MARTIN
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
I am – so sorry.

MARTIN
(slight hitch of breath) Thank you.

(drawn-out breath) It’s -… It’s better, this way.

ARCHIVIST
If, If you do need to talk, I –

MARTIN
I can’t.

ARCHIVIST
No. No, o-o-of course. (inhale) Listen, Martin, you should know –

MARTIN
John…

ARCHIVIST
Daisy might be alive. Basira is –

MARTIN
(overlapping) Stop. Stop, please; I – I shouldn’t know any of this, I –

[There’s a strange sound here – it could be a low, rumbling static, but it could also be the sound of Martin gathering his things. The sound it most closely resembles is actually that of… another tape recorder running.]
MARTIN
I, I really need to go; I, I –

ARCHIVIST
Right. (softer) Right.

[The sound stops.]
MARTIN
Please stop finding me.

[He gets up to go.]
ARCHIVIST
What happened, Martin?

[Pause.]
MARTIN
You died.

ARCHIVIST
I came back.

MARTIN
Yeah –

[He opens the door.]
MARTIN
– and I’m not going to let it happen again.

ARCHIVIST
Wait – Wait, wh–

Statement of Kulbir Shakya, regarding a flood that occurred around his house in Hackney. Original statement given September 4th, 2013. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
In many ways, I lost my home even before all this happened. I lived in that house my entire life. Hackney was my area, my community; it wasn’t some fashionable postcode or investment opportunity.

I should have seen the signs, I suppose. Little independent coffee shops sprouting up like weeds between the paving stones. Micro-breweries and taprooms cropping up in old industrial estates. Even though the Prince of Wales had to close its doors because it couldn’t afford the new business rights. The faces I knew and recognized gradually being outnumbered by young, trendy white people in artfully shabby clothes, who thought they were blending in… and precise-looking real-estate agents in well-pressed suits taking pictures of dilapidated buildings.

I complained, of course, made all the right noises of disapproval, but… I still drank the overpriced coffee. Still shopped at all the shiny new franchise outlets.

I thought because I’d been living there so long, I’d be alright. Hell, the house had been my grandfather’s before he died. But, we never had the money to actually buy it, and as property values skyrocketed, the landlord who had always seemed so understanding… suddenly started itching to sell. And there was no way I could afford the new rent on the meager salary of my admin job. I looked into getting roommates, subletting, all sorts. But by that point, I was already too deep in debt, and there was just no way I was going to be able to stay.

So I started the long and painful process of moving in with my sister. It was… humiliating. The flat she lived in with her husband was much smaller than the house, and I couldn’t afford a storage unit, so much of what I owned, a lot of which had once belonged to my grandfather, had to be thrown away. We actually got into a blazing row over his old khukuri.

He had been a Ghorkali, serving in the 5th Gurkha Rifles during the second World War. I have… complicated feelings on his military history, of course, but… he had always been fiercely proud of it. And that old knife had been one of his most treasured possessions. I didn’t keep it polished like he had, even at ninety years old, but it reminded me of him. I could see his calloused hand on its hilt as he meticulously, almost mechanically, cleaned it, humming a tune the name of which I never learned. He had been a man of discipline, in many ways many harsh, but he loved me and my sister very much, and the idea of throwing away his blade felt like a – kick in my chest.

In the end, she agreed, though, and it wasn’t long before I was spending my last nights in an almost-abandoned house, shelves bare and wardrobes empty, trying my best to sleep on a mattress I knew I was leaving behind.

The letter came the next day. The envelope was slightly damp, like it had been carried through the rain, and it had my name printed on the front in a business-like Sans serif font. It looked at first like any other piece of financial junk mail you might glance at once and throw away, but I read it anyway.

The letter claimed to be from a financial firm named Eberhart and Strauss. At least, those were the names on the letterhead. The first words did nothing to dissuade me from my assumption it was junk mail. ‘Drowning in debt? We can help!’ in big, friendly text that seemed at odds with the pseudo-respectable image the rest of it seemed to be striving for.

But as I read through it, I realized that… not only was it addressed to me specifically – not a difficult job for modern batch printing – but it made references to some very specific aspects of my situation. Precise amounts of debt. Names of creditors, and the sort of details that made it clear that this was definitely written to me. It didn’t give any indication of the exact assistance that Eberhart and Strauss was supposedly offering, but it did give an address, and told me to call on them at my convenience. At the bottom, in that same friendly typeface, it assured me that ‘we can help with the pressure.’

I don’t know what I expected; I really don’t. What, they were just going to hand me ten grand and another four hundred a month to cover the rent increase? I mean, I knew about loan sharks, and debt consolidation companies, and the dozens of other scams that prey on those in desperate situations like mine. This was just going to be another one of them. But, the letter had been to me specifically, and maybe somewhere in the back of my mind… I was genuinely hoping for a way out.

The address they gave me was for a tall, thin building in Hammersmith that housed about a half dozen more firms and a couple of tech startups. It didn’t look like the sort of place that high-prestige businesses would have their premises?, and more than one of the names listed on the plaque next to the revolving door had been roughly scratched out, I assume indicating they were no longer in business.

I asked at the front desk about Eberhart and Strauss, and was directed to an extremely cramped lift that rattled me up to the fourth floor. There was a buzzer next to the door, and it seemed to be broken and made no sound at all when I pressed it. My finger came away wet, and looking up, I could see some sort of leak in the ceiling, dripping water down onto the button. I tried the handle, and the door opened, quietly.

The rooms beyond were empty. Bare wooden floors, no curtains or wallpaper, a few abandoned chairs and cheap-looking desks. The light switch did nothing, though the dull grey light of a cloudy day filtered through the window bright enough to see by. Every surface was damp, slick with old water and warped with mildew. It dripped slowly down the walls and seeped into the rotten wood of what furniture was left. I could see a line of liquid in the bare lightbulbs.

I was confused; obviously, I was, and stepped back out to double-check the door, and sure enough; these were the offices of Eberhart and Strauss. I felt… disgust rise in my throat; the awful, humid air of the waterlogged place sitting heavy in my lungs. I checked the draws in one of the desks, but… even if the mushy pulp inside had once been paper, it wasn’t anymore. Confused and angry, I turned around and left.

It started raining on the walk home. When would you start to worry about the rain? I don’t mean about it ruining your day or wrecking an event you’re planning, but at what point does it stop being normal and start to alarm you? I’ve lived my whole life in London, so I’ve seen plenty of rain in my time. I’ve lived through weeks when you catch what minutes you can when the sky closes for a moment and you can run to the bus stop. I’ve seen poorly maintained roads turn into tiny lakes, and I’ve seen Hackney towns turned into a muddy swamp. So the first day didn’t worry me.

The rain pounded down steadily outside, and I sat in my bare, dismal home, waiting for my sister to pick me up. It drummed on the roof, rhythmic and insistent, cascading off in tiny waterfalls, and just for a moment… I found myself almost completely at peace.

Then I felt a drop, heavy and wet, land on the back of my neck, and it shattered all at once. I looked up, and I saw the spreading patch of damp in the center of my ceiling. Evicted or not, part of me recoiled to see my home starting to finally crumble, as though my leaving would take the last part of its hope.

The water was warm, and after the heat of the summer’s day, I breathed in, expecting the smell of petrichor. But the scent of the rain was something else, something earthy and cloying I couldn’t quite place.

It was a storm; there seemed to be no doubt of that, and I didn’t blame Boana [?] for not wanting to drive in this weather. I was a bit annoyed that she hadn’t called, but looking at my phone it was quite clear it wasn’t getting any signal.

Now, that wasn’t necessarily a surprise, given the storm, but it did present me with a problem: Namely, that my television and computer had already been sent over to my sister’s place, and without any signal, I was left with pretty much two options: sit doing nothing and listen to the rain, or head out into it. I opened the door for about three seconds before I decided that sitting and waiting was the better choice.

I walked upstairs, pulled a seat to the window overlooking the road, and… I sat there, watching. The drains were already starting to flood, puddles growing around the parked cars, reaching up and over, eager to meet in the middle to turn from a pool of water into something much more. I expected cars, maybe people running desperately to their homes, but the street outside was quiet, save for the pounding of the downpour.

Ten minutes. Twenty. Half an hour passed, and I didn’t see a single soul. Not a car, or a bike, not even a bus. That started to worry a bit; the 394 should pass by every fifteen minutes or so, but I definitely hadn’t seen it. Did they know something I didn’t? Was there some sort of weather warning out that I’d missed, for Hackney?

That was when I heard the first peal of thunder. There was no lightning, I want to be very clear on that. Nothing broke the uniform iron grey of the sky, dark and solid as far as I could see. But the thunder hit like a hammer. It rolled, deeper than I had heard even in the most violent of storms, and it just… kept going. I could feel it shaking through my whole body, and for a moment I thought that I was wrong, and it must have been a proper earthquake. Then it faded, and the world was silent again, save the impact of the rain.

When my watch told me it was nine o’clock, I dragged myself over to the mattress and told myself I might as well sleep through the rest of the storm, even though the sky seemed no darker than before. I tried to relax, and let the rhythmic tapping of the rain lull me off to sleep, like it always had when I was a boy, but I could find no comfort in it. It sounded too much like it wanted to get in.

The thunder woke me, another long, deep roar that seemed to come as much from the ground as it did from the clouds. The rain still hammered down outside, and I checked my watch, staring at it in confusion. It didn’t make any sense. It said it was three AM, the middle of the night, but looking out of the window, the world was still light.

The sky was cloudy and grey, as it had been the previous day, and the rain made it impossible to see further than the end of the street. But all the same, it definitely wasn’t night. There were no streetlights turned on, and, now that I looked for it, I couldn’t see any windows lit in any of the other houses on the street. It seemed like it was just me. Me and the steady, driving rain.

The road was beginning to properly flood now, with an inch or two of water creeping up over the edges, and starting to cover the pavement and climbing up the tires of the parked cars. I started to consider trying to leave. Perhaps I had missed some sort of official evacuation, some huge storm warning, and I was in terrible danger.

But no, that was ridiculous; this wasn’t some rural town panicking at the prospect of a flash flood; this was East London. If there was some sort of disaster coming, I would’ve seen something, an emergency vehicle, or at least someone in a high-vis vest. (sigh) I was overreacting. It was just the rain keeping everybody home. They all just wanted to stay dry.

I lied to myself until the water was too high for me to even consider going outside in it, and I was trapped. By the time it started to pour into the downstairs of the house, I had just about accepted that, whatever was going on, there was no longer a day or a night, just the storm and the rain and the thunder.

It’s odd how you gradually come to accept things as real. By the time you drop the last of your rationalizations, there’s no longer any surprise left in you, just an awareness that no matter how wrong it might feel, it’s the reality you’re now in. I walked down the stairs, as low as I could without stepping into the water, and I watched it.

It was dark and murky, obscuring anything below its surface as soon as it was covered. I reached my hand out, and pushed it gently into the flood. It was warm, as warm as my hand and moments after the water covered it, my mind could no longer easily tell where my skin ended and the water began. It should only have been half a foot deep at most, but reaching in I couldn’t feel the floor. I pulled my hand out and returned upstairs.

By the time the rain stopped, it was halfway up the staircase, and had almost completely submerged the cars parked outside. The thrumming of the rain gave way to sudden silence, and for a moment I allowed myself the smallest sliver of hope. The streets outside were still, the top of the floodwaters flat and undisturbed. The sky remained those same dingy clouds, but it seemed to be holding its breath.

Then, one by one, the headlights on the cars lit up. They shone out into the water that covered them, faintly illuminating the murky liquid for a few feet below the surface. And that’s when I finally saw things moving. Silhouettes gliding through the water with smooth, undulating motions. They might’ve been the shape of people; it was hard to tell for sure. They moved too fast, darting in and out of the lights, before my eyes could fully register what they were seeing.

I left the window and returned to the mattress. I was tired; I was hungry; and, without the motion of the rain, the air had become intolerably humid. Every breath I took filled my lungs with that thick, wet scent, and it felt like I could barely get enough oxygen to think. The walls of my house were slick with moisture, now, and there was nowhere I could go to be dry, no way out of this oppressive, cloying damp. Then the thunder came for the last time. It shook and rattled with more force than it ever had before, and the empty oak wardrobe fell over with a crash.

I ran to the window and found that the floodwaters were rising again, but faster this time, and not because of any rain. The house, the street, the world, was sinking into that unending line of water, which I was now certain stretched out to the horizon. Inch by inch, foot by foot, everything was descending into the water’s embrace. It would wrap itself around me, reach down my throat and fill me with its choking darkness.

There was nothing I could do. As the water reached the top of the stairs and started to flow out towards my open bedroom door, I looked around desperately for any escape that I might have overlooked. And I saw something lying just behind the fallen wardrobe. It must have fallen there months ago. It was the worn leather sheath to my grandfather’s khukuri.

I walked over and picked it up. I stared at it. I could feel that warm, grasping water cover my feet, my ankles, slowly working its way up my calf, but in that moment all I could think about was my grandfather, and how he had looked when they gave him his diagnosis: Calm and solid.

He had thanked his doctor, without hesitation, and although I knew he had been afraid, he had spent those last months methodically preparing for the end. He had always endured his problems, never trying to squirm out of things he felt he had to face.

I gripped the sheath in both my hands and waded to the window. Corpses floated by, slowly waving at me gently, their lifeless hands grey and bloated. I ignored them, and stepped out into the water.

I don’t know if you have ever drowned, but it’s the most painful thing I have ever experienced. I tried to remain calm, to think on my grandfather and his firm, stony face, but even he had begged the painkillers at the end. Even he had been afraid.

My lungs spasmed painfully, desperately trying to wring air out of the warm, rancid water that filled them, and as I felt the water embrace me fully, pressing in on all sides, I gripped the last connection I had to the world I knew. The last thing I was conscious of was the water getting colder.

I don’t – remember them fishing me out of Regent’s Canal, or much of my treatment, to be honest. At a certain point it all blurs together. I’m alive, and that’s what matters. And I’ve been living with my sister and her husband for a month or two. She doesn’t believe me, of course, and is keen to put the whole thing behind us, though I catch her staring at me sometimes. I suspect she thinks I might have done it on purpose… but she doesn’t know. She doesn’t know what it’s like, to really hear the rain.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

(sigh) One thing that always strikes me when I read statements like this is… the bias of survivorship. With one or two notable exceptions, the only statements the Institute receives are those where the witness has successfully escaped whatever terrible place or being has marked them for a victim. I wonder how many don’t make it out. How many of those shapes in the water were once just like Mr. Shakya.

Hm. (dry laugh) Or perhaps I shouldn’t wonder. Even as I say it, I can feel the knowledge pushing at my mind, eager to find a way in.

But I don’t want it. I don’t want to know. I don’t want to see. No more than I wanted to see how Gertrude stopped the Buried, and their ritual, but that came to me as well. (short sigh of a laugh) They called it “the Sunken Sky,” and she calculated, correctly, that casting a Void-touched body down the pit at the right time would be enough to disrupt it. Something she found, in Jan Kilbride.

But Gertrude also realized that the body need not be alive. Or in one piece. She thought it was a mercy. It wasn’t.

I don’t like this. I don’t like not being sure what’s going to be in my mind. What thoughts are mine and what are from… elsewhere. Why I just know some statements are just what I should be reading. I assume this one is related to the coffin, to Daisy. I haven’t heard from Basira since she left on whatever secret errand, and I’m no closer to understanding any of this.

(sigh) I suppose, if this one managed to free himself from the Buried, I-I-I – to find a way out of whatever part of choked embrace is drowning, I-I-I –

[The static of the Archivist begins.]
I need an anchor. I – I could go in myself – I could find her, and – then I’d just need to get out.

[The static stops.]
I need something out here. Something I can know the way back to. I – I don’t know what. But… (short, dry laugh) It’s a start. (genuine delight)

Gertrude Robinson recording. December 19th, 2008. In your own time.

LUCIA
Right, okay, so. Um. I was on holiday, actually, meant to be, at least. No, no, I was. Whatever happened later, it was, technically, a holiday. Sorry. I’m rambling. I like to travel, when I can. I’m not one of those people who can take months and months and… go swimming with dolphins or… climb Machu Picchu. My job is very high-pressure. Well. It was.

The point is, I… used to take a lot of city breaks. Spending a long weekend flying off to anywhere with decent flights, and… seeing the sights. I generally try to take in an art gallery, a-a few of the best restaurants the guidebook recommends, and somewhere with a decent view of the whole city. And of course, a couple of churches.

I’ve… always had an odd relationship with churches. I suppose I was raised Church of England, but my parents were never very involved with it, and when I told them I wanted to stop going when I was fourteen, they didn’t make a fuss. I had a few years as an angry atheist, but when I was about twenty, I swung back the other way a bit, and became pretty fascinated with religion. Not in a believe sense, but I found it all really interesting, especially early Christianity and the church-so much politics over what it means to be good, to be holy. So many heresies about the Trinity, about – how human Jesus was, about – how many nails they used to crucify him – but more than that. I loved churches. These big, quiet, echoing spaces of peace and beauty, designed to quiet the soul, and prepare it for communion with the divine. Even if I didn’t actually believe in the god they were supposed to house, I always found them… meditative.

And whenever I went on one of my breaks, I’d always try to find a local church- hopefully not too full of other tourists like me – and spend an hour or two in quiet contemplation. I’d listen to the shuffling footsteps of the other people, and breathe in the lingering smell of incense, before lighting a candle to my grandmother. She had always been very religious- although, since most of the churches I visited were picked for their design, they tended to be Catholic or Orthodox, and I’m not sure how happy she had been about my lighting a candle for her in them. Still, at the end of the day, I did it for me, not her. She’s gone. There isn’t anything but us.

Anyway, when a deal came up in the middle of October for five days in Istanbul, I jumped on it. I’d heard a lot of lovely things about the city itself, but more importantly, I’d just been reading a brilliant series of articles on early schisms in the church, specifically the various gnostic sects that started springing up around the fourth century, many located in what was then Constantinople, and is now Istanbul.

Do you know about gnosticism? It’s the sort of dualism that places the purity and goodness of the spiritual world in opposition to the baseness and corruption of the material world. Some gnostic movements even go so far as to posit the existence of the demiurge: A counterpoint to the god of the spiritual world, who created material existence as a warped, imperfect imitation of its purity. Everything that is base, corrupt, and vile in the physical world comes from them. If God, as gnostics see him, is the god of the soul, then the demiurge could easily be called the god of the flesh. Of- bone and blood. Of meat.

I had read about an old gnostic temple some miles outside of Istanbul, and decided to make a short trip out to see it. When I got there, though, there was nothing but a disappointment. What the artfully lit photos had shown as stark and ancient, were in person just… empty and old. Whatever decoration there once had been had long since worn away, and only the occasional plastic tourist signs indicated it had ever been a place of worship. Whatever peace I was looking for, I wasn’t going to find it there. It was barely more than a ruin. More than that. I seemed to be almost entirely alone. There had been an old woman coming out of it when I arrived, but I hadn’t seen anyone apart from her, not even at the ticketing booth.

As I wandered the small building, I became more and more aware of the quiet, and of the wind that blew gently through the open windows. I did my best to shrug off the growing feeling of unease that had settled over me, and walked back outside. The taxi that had taken me had long since departed, and the temple stood alone, some distance from any other inhabited building. The afternoon was wearing on, and I didn’t fancy trying to walk all the way back to my hotel, but my initial plan of asking a staff member to call me another taxi was somewhat scuppered by their absence.

As I was considering my options, I heard the roar of an engine, and looked over to see a heavy-looking truck slowly rolling down the street towards me. It had no obvious markings, and the back of it was covered with a grey tarp. For some reason it filled me with the most intense dread I’ve ever felt, and I found myself stepping back, behind a pillar, desperately hoping I was out of sight.

The truck pulled around the side of the building, and I heard the engine stop. I crept forward, still not sure why I had such instinctive terror of what seemed to be on the surface a perfectly normal vehicle. But as three men climbed out of the front, and started to walk back towards the covered load, I started to realize I could smell something. Damp. Slightly sour, with the faintest hint of iron.

I realized what it was a moment before the tarpaulin fell, and revealed the huge pile of pink and white and brown. A-At first I thought the bodies were all human-that perhaps I had somehow stumbled upon some sort of – gang, disposing of a massacre’s worth of corpses.

But then some of them started to move. Squirming limbs were dragging, rising, extracting themselves from this massive mound of flesh, and making their way down to join their companions on the ground, one by one. Most of them could still be mistaken for humans at a distance. A few even wore clothes. No one said a word.

After a minute or so, it looked like everything that was going to climb down off the truck had done so. The pile of meat still rose several meters up from the back of the truck, and as much as I wanted to look away, I couldn’t. M-most of it was just- unidentifiable chunks, but a lot of it was clearly animal: chickens, lambs; I even saw a whole pig head.

Some of it was human. I could see a man’s torso near the top of the pile and an arm jutted out near the base, the hand splayed out at the end. I had the weirdest impulse to wave at it. The driver – or, the one I assume was the driver – then started to reach up onto the pile. He took a handful of meat, and turned to- whoever or whatever was nearest to him. He passed it on to them, and then they would turn, and head towards the back of the temple, towards an unmarked temple I’d assumed was staff only.

Now it was open, and they went in, one at a time. They didn’t come back out. All this time, I’d just been watching from my hiding spot, totally frozen in confusion and fear. As I said, the temple stood apart from any other buildings, and.. if I tried to leave, the chances were higher that I’d be spotted. I thought I could maybe just wait. Just. Stay where I was until these people had finished doing whatever it was they were doing. And then they would drive away, and I would leave, and spend the rest of my life pretending I had never seen anything, (breath) that I had gone to an art gallery instead.

This plan lasted right up until the driver saw me. It was my own fault. My leg was starting to cramp up, so I tried to shift position – but I didn’t realize just how painful it would be to move, and I let out a cry before I had a chance to stifle it. The driver’s head snapped up and focused on me. He was rail-thin, dressed in rough overalls, with shaggy black hair and pale skin. He was East Asian – Chinese, maybe, but he called me over in a crisp British accent. His tone was firm, but unhurried, and to my ears, not immediately threatening. So I did as he asked.

I walked, slowly, but deliberately over to him, hands out to my side, doing my best to show him I wasn’t a threat. I made the decision that-whatever was happening, my best chance to make it out was just – keep doing as I was asked.

By the time I reached the truck, the smell was so thick I could taste it. I stood there, legs shaking, muttering a prayer to a god I didn’t even believe in. He stared at me for what felt like hours, but – can’t have been longer than a few seconds. And he shrugged. Turned to the truck and picked up what looked like the back half of a goat. He held it out to me, expectantly. Honestly, I was so surprised I just took it on instinct. The driver nodded to himself, like he’d made the right decision, and I turned, and started to walk towards the door, afraid that any hesitation might make him reconsider, mark me out as something other than what he had decided I was.

I – don’t eat much meat, and rarely ever cook it myself, but I held that cold haunch to me like a talisman. As if it might ward whatever awful thing waited inside that door. As I got closer, I saw one of the others, a tall, gangly woman with arms that bent backwards leaving the entrance. She had to stoop to get through. But as she raised back up to her full height, I felt her eyes rest on me for a second. I didn’t slow my pace or meet her gaze. She walked past me quickly, on the way back to the truck for her next load.

I stepped through the entrance, moving carefully down what looked to be a rough-hewn stone stairway. It went deeper and deeper, far below where any normal basement might have been. So narrow at points that I had trouble fitting. My mind kept trying to imagine meeting one of the less human-looking things coming back up the other way, but I didn’t let it. Finally, I reached the bottom, and stepped out into a scene I s-s-still see every time I close my eyes.

I don’t know how big the room would have been to begin with. Only one side had anything that might’ve once been considered an interior wall. The others were rough rock and stone, clearly hollowed out and extended until the place must have been almost forty yards across. In the middle of the floor, taking up almost the entirety of the strange vault, was a pit. (mm) No, not a pit. Not exactly. The others stood around the edge, throwing their burdens down into it one piece at a time. And there, at the bottom, was another pile. One that dwarfed the truck outside. One that would have dwarfed a hundred trucks. Because I couldn’t actually see the bottom. For all I know, it could’ve gone down forever, an endless pillar of flesh.

But then it moved, and I realized in a second what it actually was I was looking at. Not a pit. A mouth. I feel a strange, deep pride that I didn’t scream. I didn’t panic, though my mind felt like it was trying to shut down at the repulsive sight. Instead, I forced myself to take my place there at the edge, and hurl my… offering down into it. It accepted it greedily. I wish I could say I ran, then, or that I found a clever trick to escape, but I didn’t. When I returned to the surface, I was handed more meat, before I even had a chance to consider getting away.

So I decided I would keep up the ruse until the truck was empty, in the hopes that I would have a chance later. But as we unloaded the last of the grim cargo, and I carried a heavy, red tongue down into the vault, I saw another truck pull up, almost identical to the first; then another; then another.

There was no end to them. Day turned into night turned into day again, and still I carried meat, and threw it into the hole. And my back was screaming. My legs were weak. And my mind was numb from terror. But I was spurred on by one thing: the woman with the backwards arms had fallen, sometime in the night, and her companions had showed no hesitation. They had gripped her shoulders, hoisted her up, and hurled her straight into the gaping maw. I swore it wouldn’t happen to me.

All through this, the mouth got closer and closer to the edge of the pit. The pile of flesh within it grew larger and larger, sat there in an awful, half-solid slurry, chewed and crushed together. It was impossible to tell what had once been animal, and what might have once been us. It was all just meat.

And as the mouth got closer, the smell got stronger. The air became thick, and the walls began to sweat a pinkish liquid, like cutting into a steak. More of those workers had been thrown in, replaced by others brought in the- endless procession of meat trucks. I didn’t know what was going to happen when it finally reached the top, but I knew it would be something bad. Something unspeakable. And I would have helped make it happen.

When the explosion came, it was a blessed relief. A deep rumble passed through the structure of the building, a deafening cry of rage and dismay that came from below, as the roof collapsed downwards, burying it under a torrent of rubble and stone.

I was lucky. At that moment, I had been stood in the bottom of the stairwell, and as the world collapsed around me, I began to sprint up the stairs. But I barely made it halfway up before that toppled as well, and I felt the foundations of the temple above fall down around me. I thought I was dead. I wish I had been.

I don’t know how long I lay-trapped there before Turkish rescue workers found me. Certainly long enough that the scent of rot began to waft up from far below. I was delirious and barely conscious. I-I tried to warn them, to tell them to finish the job – but all that did was convince them that there might be other survivors.

They, um, haven’t told me what they found down there. They paid for my flight home, but haven’t told me anything. I don’t know anything. I, I just want to sleep. (businesslike tone) That’s it. That’s all I have. That’s what happened.

GERTRUDE
And… Do you feel any better?

LUCIA
No.

GERTRUDE
Well that’s a shame. Hang on, let me see if I can find you the number for that counseling service. They’re, They’re actually quite good.

[As she speaks, she moves, and we hear the rustling of her clothes and a couple of footsteps.]
LUCIA
If you say so.

[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
GERTRUDE
Well. That is a relief. When I heard there had been survivors of the Last Feast, I was rather concerned that one of them might be able to positively identify me, (ha) which could land me in all sorts of trouble. (she inhales) But she doesn’t seem to remember me at all.

Tom Haan might be a bit more of a problem, as it looks like he also survived, but I’m hopeful he has been weakened enough by this failure to not be an issue in the near future. Hopefully, he’ll fade away or burn out as they tend to when robbed of their purpose. Still, I should keep a watch on him in case of any erratic behavior that might lead to complications. Also worth watching out for any… additional esoteric fallout from the ritual attempt, like that Carlisle boy down in Wandsworth.

Dekker really came through with the explosives. It almost felt like cheating. Sad about the loss of history, but… Miss Wright didn’t seem to think the old gnostic church got many visitors anyway. I’m honestly impressed she had the strength to get through it, even if she does seem to have been.. deeply affected by it. Shame about the dreams. I would avoid them if I could.

At least we know for sure that these grand rituals can be disrupted by conventional means, though a more… nuanced approach will be needed for some of them, I’m sure.

Also… I can’t rely on having this much lead time. I’ve had ten years tracking supplicants drawn by the siren call of flesh, watching them gradually stockpiling meat. Very useful, in terms of preparation time for derailing the final push, but in future, I think I need to get a little bit more… pro-active.

ARCHIVIST
I found this tape tucked in a corner of my desk drawer (sigh) covered in cobwebs. I suppose subtlety has gone out the window a bit, and the question is now simply… how much I trust the Spider to have my best interests at heart.

Hm. I suspect my assuming it has a heart might be a clue I’m looking at this the wrong way. (sigh) Even so, and – leaving aside the matter of Gertrude’s actions for a moment – what is it trying to tell me with this? Is it about… rituals? About getting Daisy back?

About – About an anchor. What was it she said, “the siren call of flesh.” Hm. It’s possible, I suppose. It would – hurt, but – well, what’s another scar?

(small sigh) It’s been two weeks since I heard from Basira. I’m not waiting any longer. I’m getting Daisy back.

What’re you doing?

ARCHIVIST
[Surprised] Oh! Uh…

[CLOSES DESK DRAWER]
Melanie, I-I’m… S-Sorry, I didn’t, er… I didn’t know you were there.

MELANIE
[Enunciating carefully] What are you doing?

ARCHIVIST
I’m… Would you believe I’m… trying to save Daisy?

MELANIE
[Sharply] With more bullshit surgery?

ARCHIVIST
Oh I… Melanie, I-I-I’m so sorry.

MELANIE
[Weary] Oh, fuck off!

ARCHIVIST
I was trying to save your life.

MELANIE
Yes, well… you did. I think. But I also, y’know, see your face now, when I wake up screaming. I feel you digging into my leg. Chalk it up as a win for Team Archive, I guess.

ARCHIVIST
I wanted to ask you.

MELANIE
And if you had, we wouldn’t be talking right now. I’d have said no, and I’d probably have hurt you. Basira was right. The only way to do it was to completely betray my trust, and destroy any remaining sense of safety.

So, yes. Thank you.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, I-I’m… I’m surprised you can stand to see either of us.

MELANIE
[Frustratedly] Who else is there? I mean, Basira is… heh. She’s been the only one for a long time and, yes, I, sort of, maybe, hate her now. I don’t know. I can’t look at her without my leg hurting. But what else am I going to do? I don’t want to be on my own, and I’m stuck here. So…

ARCHIVIST
Basira said you were doing better.

MELANIE
[Distressed] Would you just stop? [Getting agitated] This isn’t better. I’m not dying, and I don’t want to kill you. It’s – It’s… it’s just different! Yes, it’s sort of, ‘better’, maybe, but… but I can’t –

ARCHIVIST (BACKGROUND)
No… Right, no I – Y-Yeah, Melanie –

Melanie…

MELANIE
Don’t tell me to calm down! Don’t you dare!

ARCHIVIST
Right, yes, I…

[MELANIE EXHALES, REGATHERING COMPOSURE]
MELANIE
Basira is… um. Basira deals in ‘intel’ these days, in usable data, assets. Not feelings. Not people. Crying, shaking, nightmares… that is better. It doesn’t feel like it, but as far as Basira sees it… I’m not ‘compromised’ anymore. And… that… is better.

ARCHIVIST
At least it’s out. Maybe… maybe It’s enough to start healing? Start letting go of the anger.

MELANIE
Oh just stop! Just stop and listen!

ARCHIVIST
Okay.

MELANIE
[Charged tones] Yes, the bullet was bad, right, but it didn’t make me angry. Anger is… Anger’s been all I’ve had for a very long time. Years. Maybe since… oh, I, I don’t know. But everything I’ve done, everything I pushed for was because I was angry.

Angry at being passed over, being disrespected, ignored. That sort of anger, it – it powers you. Right up until it slips out and hurts someone.

I hurt someone. And then one day, I suddenly have this thing that takes all that rage, and it holds it, tells me it’s right, that it’s me. It didn’t stay in my leg because of some ghostly master plan. It stayed because I wanted it.

ARCHIVIST
[Realising] Shit.

MELANIE
Yes.

ARCHIVIST
…

Melanie, I –

MELANIE
So, why are you trying to chop off your finger?

ARCHIVIST
[Awkwardly] Oh! I… I um… I nee-need a… I’ve been thinking of it a-as an anchor. I think. I… know. Something I have a connection to, th-that I can use to find my way out of the Coffin when I reach Daisy. I-I figured the strongest anchor would be… part of my own body.

MELANIE
Okay. So… just cut it off.

ARCHIVIST
I’m doing my best.

MELANIE
Hmph. Can’t go through with it?

ARCHIVIST
Oh, th-the blade keeps going in. And… it hurts. Hurts plenty.

But then it heals up. Pretty much the moment I take it out. No wound, no scar, nothing.

MELANIE
I could try?

ARCHIVIST
I… don’t think that would be a good idea right now.

MELANIE
Maybe not.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, you’d think I’d have a better idea how to do it.

All these… all these statements and…

Hi, Helen.

ARCHIVIST
[Coldly] I have been told you can help.

HELEN
I have been trying to. But the last time you were very rude to me.

ARCHIVIST
You’re still wearing her face.

HELEN
Not this again. I’m not “wearing” anything, Archivist. I am at least as much ‘Helen Richardson’ as you are the ‘Jonathan Sims’ that first joined this Institute. Things change. People change. It happens.

ARCHIVIST
We’re not people, though, are we? Not any more.

HELEN
Names. Categories. It’s all so important to you, isn’t it? You do know none of it’s actually real. It’s all just meaningless boxes.

MELANIE
Is… he still in there?

HELEN
Oh, yes. He’s not exactly something I can… digest. He’s a bit of an irritant, to be honest. If you’re looking to let him out, I could be persuaded.

ARCHIVIST
When did you say they attacked?

MELANIE
A couple of months ago.

ARCHIVIST
And he’s been in there… ever since?

HELEN
I helped clean up.

MELANIE
After I, uh… took care of things.

ARCHIVIST
All this time. Why didn’t anyone tell me?

MELANIE
Basira said not to.

ARCHIVIST
I see.

Why didn’t you kill him?

MELANIE
I stabbed him in three different hearts. Didn’t work. If you want to go hunting for a fourth, knock yourself out.

ARCHIVIST
I…er… I’m alright, I think

MELANIE
So, what’s the plan?

ARCHIVIST
Right. I go in, I offer freedom if he… helps. Then I hope he doesn’t kill me. If he tries anything…

HELEN
I would suggest running. Try to find a door.

ARCHIVIST
Naturally.

Still do.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

JARED
Alright.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. O-Okay. D-Do you need to know… w-what it is?

JARED
Not much you could want, comin’ to me. Put summat in. Take summat out. Which is it?

ARCHIVIST
Take something out.

A bone. A rib, probably. S-Something I won’t miss.

JARED
Done. Come ‘ere.

ARCHIVIST
I, uh… H-How do I know you won’t just reach in and kill me? W-W-What guarantees do I have?

JARED
Guarantees? None. But I want to leave more than I want to kill you. Not like it was my idea in the first place.

ARCHIVIST
So…

[Compellingly] Why did you and the others attack us?

JARED
I was asked. You want my statement, that’s gonna cost you another rib.

ARCHIVIST
I-I could just pull the information out of you.

[MENACINGLY MEATY MURMURS]
JARED
You could try.

ARCHIVIST
Okay. Fine. A rib for me, a rib for you, your freedom and a statement.

JARED
Yeah. Alright.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Statement first.

JARED
…

Fine.

ARCHIVIST
Uh. Statement of Jared Hopworth, the Boneturner.

Statement begins.

[THROATY LAUGH]
JARED (STATEMENT)
Where do you want me to start? Growing up? My folks? How ‘bout that growth spurt when I was nine? It left me taller than all the other kids. I hated them, the way they stared. But they were scared, and that felt good, even back then. It felt right. My Dad was proud of it too. He was a short man, bully, and watching me loom over people really made ‘im happy. Mum just scowled, but then… heh, she always did.

I wrecked my school. I did have friends, but they left me, one by one, until all that I had were the dregs; the ones who stayed ‘coz they were too scared to leave. We were always either in trouble, or looking for it. Those were bad times. I tried to look ahead, but I couldn’t see anything. No future, no hope; just bitter parents, and whatever misery I could pass on to everyone else. God knows what would’ve happened if that little prick Sebastian hadn’t given me that book.

I didn’t know what it was at first, not really. But it talked to me about bones and flesh and muscle and blood; the bits of myself I actually knew and liked. So I listened, and I read, and I learned. I fumbled through the lessons the book wanted to teach me, and my first try was clumsy. Stupid. Turns out, Dad didn’t like being tall nearly as much as he thought he would. And Mum didn’t like her new smile, either. So I left.

I wandered around for a bit. Worked a lotta jobs where it didn’t matter what you looked like. There’s always a spot for someone who can get rid of people. You must have heard about me. I left plenty of people scared and crying, itching to tell someone what happened to ‘em. Some of them must have made it to you.

There were others. Others of skin and hunger; they tried to talk to me about gods. They’d go on and on about remaking the world; of a new day of blood and flesh. I told them to piss off. I like the world just as it is. I take what I want and I make myself more, and when people look at me… that fear – it feels amazing. Some of my mates, the ones I helped find their proper bodies, they listened, and went to feed the hunger. Not me though. I never was that ambitious.

The letters started comin’ in about two years ago. Good white paper, large print. Nice and simple. Dunno who sent them, they were never signed, and I dunno how they kept finding me. There was never much in them; normally just a name and a place or a time. I ignored the first couple, but they kept coming, and eventually I got curious. So, I followed the instructions in one of ‘em. I found Regan Hasnain of 70 Clairmont Gardens, and that got rid of most of my doubts. I don’t blame people for thinking that all bones are the same, most people don’t have much experience, but it’s not true. There are good bones, and there are bad bones, and Regan Hasnain had some very good bones in her. They were solid, healthy, and they jumped at my touch. I didn’t doubt the letters again.

They came pretty regular after that. And they always led to summat good. Quality bones, a new mate, or some unlucky fool who wouldn’t look at me for the fear. It got so I trusted them. The letters, I mean. So I didn’t question them. There’s a lotta stuff in this world I’ve never understood, and these were no different. Then I got one about your lot, your Archives. Told me to go there and kill you. They even sent a picture.

So I did. Well, I tried. Didn’t know about those tunnels or wherever this place is, but the pipes… they were wide enough for me and a few friends to squeeze through, bit by bit, one bone at a time.

[DEMONSTRATIVE CRACKING ACCOMPANIES THIS]
When we came up through the floor, it was wonderful. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the look on their faces. It was like their world had gone with the floor. The weak one legged it, and I thought the skinny one did too. There was just the copper. It weren’t dressed like one, but I know police when I smell it. They tried to run, but we were everywhere, and they couldn’t stop us undoing them for parts. You weren’t there, which was sad, but it made it easier.

At least until the knife. I don’t know what the skinny one did, what she was, but that knife hurt. She screamed, and stabbed, and cut through all the others, ruining their perfect bodies. Then, she turned on me. Reached out with some of my hands, to get inside her, and pull her apart, and she cut them off. I got… scared. So I ran. I ran through the first door I found. And now I don’t know where I am.

I’m startin’ to think the letters were a trap. Was it you? Did you want me here? ‘Coz if so, well played. Mind you, lot of trouble to go through just to lose a rib, so maybe not.

That’s it, then.

Do you want to do this, or what?

ARCHIVIST
That’s it?

[HE SNORTS]
Hardly worth a rib.

[JARED LOOMS FORWARD]
[Placatingly] Alright! Alright.

Dunno. Doesn’t hurt me.

You are very welcome. I have decided that I support what you’re doing, and I’m happy to assist. I think we’ll all be much happier this way.

MELANIE
Basira’s not going to be happy that you let him out.

ARCHIVIST
Basira isn’t here.

DAISY (ON TAPE)
[…] Was a coffin. An old, wooden coffin. Rough, unvarnished. I could see splinters where the nails had been hammered in badly. Wrapped all around it was a thick metal chain ending in a heavy padlock. That weird moaning was coming from inside it. It was the only sound that cut through pounding rain.

Hello, Melanie. I.. know I said we’d wait until Basira was back, b-but I, I don’t… (heavy sigh) I-I’m sorry. I, I-I know she won’t – (sigh) She’d want to do it a different way. But I know what I’m doing; this time I do. I, I hope. I have her voice. I think that should be enough to find her, and, and I’m leaving my – (can’t say it) I’ll leave it with the tape. I should be able to find my back to it. I think. (pause) Wish me luck.

…Although, I suppose if you’re hearing this, then I… I didn’t have any. I don’t know. I, I’m – (slight pause) I’m scared? (dry laugh) When does the fear go away? (pause) A-Anyway, I’m sorry.

You too, Basira, if you’re hearing this. (pause) I know you’d – stop me. You’d be right to, but – but if this goes wrong, all you lose is – (abrupt) I’m not risking anyone else. And I know – (pause) I-I think. I can get her out.

[He clicks the tape off.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Right. You’re coming with me.

[He sighs.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Let’s do this one properly.

[We hear a static begin to rise; it’s from the coffin.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
No need for that. I’m willing.

[The static fades away as immediately as it came.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Right.

[He lifts the padlock, and the chain rattles as he pulls it off and they fall to the floor. Then we hear the ominous rattling creak as he pulls open the lid of the coffin.]
[He clicks on a torch.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
(slightly shaky) Stone steps. Roughly hewn. (slight pause) They, uh… They keep going. (brave face) Well. No point in waiting.

[We can hear his breath shake slightly as he steps into the echoing coffin. The lid closes above him almost immediately with a hollow thump.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Christ.

[He takes a deep, shaky breath, as well as a few steps.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. COFFIN]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[When the Archivist speaks, his voice sounds strained, as if he’s under some sort of intense pressure. We hear his clothes rustle as he moves.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m not sure how long it’s been. The steps ended, eventually. There’s passages, but – it’s very, uh… It’s close. I’m having some trouble, but. I’m going the right way. I know it. I just – I-I just need to keep moving. When I stop, it –

[He grunts, takes another step.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
(even more strained) It starts to – p-press on me.

[More rustling.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Just keep going.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
I-I can’t stand. Anymore. I – It’s – It’s not a passage. Not anymore. It’s a tunnel.

[The rustling noises get louder for a second.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Barely that. But I’m – I’m definitely getting closer. (strained) If I can just –

[The rustling increases in volume and intensity as the Archivist makes a few sounds of exertion. Finally, he makes it through whatever tight space had been holding him back, and he lets out a noise of relief.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
My torch is broken. I didn’t even drop it. It – It got caught against the wall, and –

[More rustling.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Crushed. God, I – (inhale) I don’t even know how long I’ve been here.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The Archivist’s voice is much closer and definitely raspier.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
I – heard someone. He was begging of me to save him. Said he couldn’t breathe. (slight pause, gasp) I can barely breathe. I couldn’t find him. But I am – (strained) not here for him. I don’t even know him. I can’t – I can’t see anything here. For all this – this place closes around me, I-I feel adrift. Like nothing can get through the dirt and the muck and –

[He loses himself to the moving for a second.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
I still have Daisy’s tape. And I still think I’m going the right way. When I move at all.

[The rustling gets louder and the motion more jerky.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Feels like every inch costs me another scrape, o-or bruise. (inhale, his voice sounds more normal) I’d hoped I was beyond that, but apparently not. And –

[He lets out a very pained sound.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
The air is heavy. Soil and dust. I am – very thirsty. But I know I won’t die of it. (moving again) I won’t die of anything down here. Not ever. Not if I – can’t find my way out. When I first came down, I could feel it, the – the part of myself I left outside, but – (inhale) But it’s been getting fainter and now… I’ll try not to think about it. Don’t – don’t want to stretch my mind, to try and see, in case it’s not there at all. I can’t afford to think about it. Not now.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[We are immediately greeted with the Archivist’s cry of pain.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
I-I think – (more cries) Oh god. I-I-I think I’m – I’m stuck.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[He’s still stuck. We can tell by the extremely labored cries of pain. But then he stops. He’s cut off by a roll of thunder.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Wha-What?

[The droning rumbling continues, accompanied by the choral hum of the coffin, and as the Archivist takes several shaky breaths of surprise, it gets louder.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
(whisper) Oh no. N–

[There’s a crack, and a sound like a landslide or shifting rocks. The Archivist yells, makes several strangled sounds, followed by many more sounds of pain.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Daisy! D-DAISY!

[More sounds of struggle.]
DAISY
(from far away) John!

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Background choral humming continues.]
ARCHIVIST
Daisy! Daisy, can you reach me?

DAISY
(is this a dream?) I can’t. Can’t see you.

ARCHIVIST
Follow my voice.

DAISY
Is that? – I, I can’t –

[Pained sound from the Archivist.]
ARCHIVIST
Ah –

DAISY
You – You’re real. You’re real.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. (pain) I’m here, Daisy.

DAISY
(still hazy) Daisy. Yeah. Daisy. That’s me.

[She lets out a short, mirthless laugh.]
ARCHIVIST
Are you alright?

[Background choral humming fades out.]
DAISY
I, I, I can’t move; I – I can’t – And I can’t – breathe, and –

[She starts breathing heavier.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh, god.

DAISY
Just – alone. I, I think. I think. I hear, uh, this, sometimes – singing. When it’s we – when it’s wet. Or scratching, trying to get out – But I don’t – I don’t – (struggling to get the words out) I don’t think there’s – there’s anyone – there. (continues struggling) It’s just – It’s just – me. Til now.

ARCHIVIST
Are you… Are you okay?

DAISY
No.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry. Obviously. No, I just meant – Y-You sound – okay.

DAISY
Do I?

ARCHIVIST
I thought you might’ve been – taken over. By the Hunt.

DAISY
What?

ARCHIVIST
The Hunt. You’re a Hunter.

DAISY
(strained) Yeah – I guess I was. But – not here.

ARCHIVIST
No.

DAISY
No. I – I can’t f-feel my blood. I could always feel it – I can’t, It can’t reach me here. (struggles) Where are we?

ARCHIVIST
The coffin. We’re in the coffin. I-It leads to… Well, it’s got a lot of names. Choke. The Buried. (pain) Too-Close-I-Cannot-Breathe.

DAISY
Yeah. Sounds – sounds right.

ARCHIVIST
Come on. (pain) Let’s get you out of here.

DAISY
Can’t – can’t move. Even – if I – if I could. There’s no way out.

ARCHIVIST
It’s okay, I’ve uh – I’ve got a plan.

DAISY
I-Is this like all your other plans?

ARCHIVIST
It’s fine; I just – I just need to – to find it.

DAISY
What?

ARCHIVIST
Come on. Come on, where are you?

DAISY
John?

ARCHIVIST
Come on.

[A large, low rumbling begins. The Archivist’s breath turns ragged. There’s a static.]
DAISY
John?

ARCHIVIST
I know.

DAISY
Th-The way out?

ARCHIVIST
No. I know where we are. There is n-no out, not here. This is – This is forever deep below creation. Where the weight of existence bears down. This is The Buried, and we are alive. There isn’t even an up. Oh god. (pain) What have I done? (whispered) What have I done?

[Silence, but for Daisy’s breathing.]
DAISY
N-Not alone, though.

ARCHIVIST
(barely a whisper) No. No, not alone.

[More silence.]
DAISY
John?

ARCHIVIST
(immediately) Still here.

DAISY
Good, I – (swallows) Good. I-I-I-I want to talk.

ARCHIVIST
Okay, um. What do you want to talk about?

DAISY
D– I, I don’t care, I-I-I just, I just want someone to hear me.

ARCHIVIST
Well, I’m not going anywhere.

[Daisy’s breathing approaches a panicked laugh, and she’s not able to get out more than a few syllables.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Daisy?

DAISY
I, I want to, but it’s – difficult.

ARCHIVIST
Would it help if I – a-ask?

DAISY
Y-Yeah, yes, alright. Do your… thing.

ARCHIVIST
(pain) Right. (he clears his throat) Uh…

[The Archivist’s static begins to build.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
How are you feeling?

DAISY
Scared. I, I’m, I’m, s-scared. I’ve been scared the whole time here. Not just when it – when it’s – cr-crushing, w-when it f-fills your – your mouth with – with di-dirt. (pause)

It knows when to stop. W-When to e-ease back, so you don’t – don’t lose it, or grow numb. L-Leaves you terrified for when it s-starts again, and when it does, y-you’re, you’re s-scared it’ll – (sniff) never – never stop.

(on the brink of crying) I thought – thought I’d (breath) I’d ne-never see the sky again, never – (close to breaking) never s-see Basira – (she composes herself)

But – But – But now – you – you’ve got out of, of, of other stuff like this; maybe, maybe you’ll get out of this, and, and then take me with you. (heavy breathing) But I don’t know what I’ll be out, outside. (pause)

The-The Hunt, it can’t reach me here. I’m s-scared, but – mm – (straining sound) But I – I feel more – feel more me… than I have for years. Maybe all my life. The Hunt was me – (strain) But I don’t – I don’t think I liked it. I think it just made me – need it. (strain) I hurt. A lot of people. And some who – who I shouldn’t have. (effort)

Did you ever hear the story Elias told me? About what I – did. How I am. He – He didn’t get a detail wrong. The Hunt. Hunger was in me all my life. Telling me who to chase. How to hurt them. (heavy breathing) I never needed to think. Who I was outside of that.

But down here, where I-I can’t hear the – blood, anymore. I, I don’t – I don’t know who I am without, without the chase. I just know that I – I don’t like who I was, back outside. I don’t want to be her again. I want – to be – better. (breathing) Mmm – (more breathing)

Y-You know what I thought, when I woke up here? I thought this was hell. I wa– I was dead, and I was in hell. And I – (sob) I knew I deserved it. (strain)

I don’t want t-to b-be a s-sadistic predator again. I-I don’t want to hobble around like some – pathetic wounded prey either. I don’t know which would be worse. But I’m sc-scared now. That I won’t ever get the choice.

ARCHIVIST
(pain) One thing I’ve learned, Daisy, is that we all get a choice. Even if it doesn’t feel like one.

[Pause.]
DAISY
I was gonna kill you. You know that, right?

[The Archivist laughs, as much as he can, current situation considered.]
ARCHIVIST
I mean, I definitely got that impression when you (pain) dragged me into the woods for an execution.

[Another sound of pain.]
DAISY
No. (heh) No. After the mission. I was planning to kill you.

ARCHIVIST
I… I did not know that.

DAISY
I realized – you were in my dreams. R-R-Reliving – this. T-The coffin. You were there.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

DAISY
Didn’t think it was real. Not really. Just my mind putting you there, because I hated you, but no. One night, you turn up in a new shirt. Didn’t fit you. Not your style.

(shaky breath) I-I didn’t think much of it, just a-a dream. Then you come back from the States, and guess what you’re wearing.

ARCHIVIST
Oh.

DAISY
(overlapping) Realized what was happening then. Realized you weren’t human. Needed to die, as soon as it was safe. Never mind Elias, and his… insurance.

ARCHIVIST
And now?

DAISY
Don’t know. I-I miss dreaming. You don’t sleep, down here.

ARCHIVIST
Daisy – you should know, I’m –

(he chooses his words carefully)

I-If I wasn’t human before, I’m, uh – I’m even less now.

[In the background, the rumbling sound of the Buried and choral hum of the coffin in the rain begins again.]
DAISY
Yeah. Well. At the moment, I don’t care.

ARCHIVIST
And if we get out?

DAISY
But we can’t get out.

ARCHIVIST
No.

[The Archivist cries out again as the wrath of the Buried comes back full force. Daisy does not yell, but her breaths get even more laboured.]
DAISY
I’m s– I’m sorry. I’m sorry, John. I’m sorry.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The Archivist lets out a breath of surprise.]
ARCHIVIST
D-Daisy!

DAISY
Uh – I’m, I’m here.

ARCHIVIST
I – I can –

[The Archivist’s static begins.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
It’s – It – It’s closer.

DAISY
What is?

ARCHIVIST
M-My, My, My anchor, my – the,

[The Archivist’s static rises.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
a rib; I can f– I can feel – I know the way.

[Various gasping noises that may also be “wh–”s from Daisy. The Archivist begins to move.]
DAISY
W-What? H-How?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t – (strain) It’s like – (strain) My – my link is – stronger.

[More straining and grunting as they move. The static grows louder, heavier.]
DAISY
(breathing heavy) Slow down. I-I can’t –

ARCHIVIST
Don’t let go. (effort) Come on. We’re close. This way.

[They continue.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Here! Here, come on – push!

DAISY
I – I am!

[They both groan loudly as they heave against the coffin lid, pushing it open. As they do, and the Archivist sighs in relief? Contentment? numerous voices overlap in the background, seemingly all talking at once, speaking over each other as if they’re in a very large crowd. The Archivist’s static fades out.]
DAISY
Wh– We’re out! We’re really out! I can’t believe –

ARCHIVIST
Umm…

DAISY
What? What is it?

ARCHIVIST
Tape recorders. Must – must be dozens of them.

[The door opens.]
BASIRA
John, you stupid idiot! What did you think—

DAISY
(soft) Hi.

BASIRA
Oh my god.

[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
DAISY
You sure?

ARCHIVIST
(surprised) No, uh, it’s, um – it’s fine.

DAISY
It’s just – Basira’s busy.

ARCHIVIST
No, I-I understand. Ho-Honestly, uh, I’d actually appreciate your insight, uh, for this one. Just – you know. Keep quiet during the statement and that.

DAISY
Sure. I-I can do quiet.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Uh, oh – do you want a chair?

DAISY
No.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Okay.

DAISY
I’m trying to get my legs right again.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, of course.

DAISY
Just ignore me. I’ll stand in the corner.

ARCHIVIST
Okay then. Statement of… (clears throat)

Statement of Percy Fawcett regarding his final expedition into the Amazon. Original statement given June 27th, 1930. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Tell nobody I am alive. I cannot be clear enough on that point. Do not try to find me after I have left. Please. All I ask is that I be allowed to live what life I have remaining in obscurity and anonymity.

I will not allow myself to be found.

Perhaps you will have read reports of my disappearance or death, constructing wild theories of violence at the hands of Kalapolos tribesmen, or a lack of adequate supplies or preparation. I can only wish my hubris had been so mundane.

I was hunting once again for the lost city of Z. I have dreamed of it for decades, ever since I read da Silva’s account of his own discovery in 1753.

The ancient ruins, the statues, hieroglyphics. The sheer unrivaled beauty of it all. Through the trenches and the mud of the Western front, it was the thought of Z that kept me going, whispered promises of discovery. The remains of an ancient city, utterly lost to time and hidden somewhere near the Xingu River.

My first expedition was alone, save for a handful of indigenous guides. I believed myself prepared, but the realities of that jungle were more than I could have foreseen, and when it finally ended, my fever-addled mind named that spot, the furthest we could reach into the jungle, ‘Dead Horse Camp,’ because that is where my horse finally fell.

I retreated in defeat, resolved to return to Dead Horse Camp at a time when I was truly ready. That time was five years later, in 1925, and I honestly believed that this time I was going to find Z. I was more prepared, and crucially, I planned not to go alone.

The Xavante, whose territory we were entering, were said to be violent and distrustful, making a large expedition unwise, so I instead brought my son Jack on board, as he had been traveling with me before, and I trusted his instincts almost as much as I trusted my own.

He, in turn, requested I include one other on the journey, a long-time friend and confidant of his: a man named Raleigh Rimmell.

I never liked the look of Raleigh. He was tall, and his features, though any one of them might have been called handsome, were badly put together on his face, giving him an appearance I’ll admit I took against at our first meeting. More than that, he had also read Manuscript 512, and I could see in his eyes the same fervor to find the city of Z as I sometimes glanced in my own.

Although there was something else there as well, behind them. Something darker, that I did not recognize, and I am hesitant to consider it too deeply even now. But Jack saw fit to invite him, and I had never before had cause to second-guess Jack’s judgement in such things.

It was Raleigh that suggested that we proceed alone after we left Dead Horse Camp. I had ensured this time we would be well-provisioned. We had horses, dogs, mules, and a pair of local labourers, who had agreed to act as our guides. But on our arrival at the camp, Raleigh dismissed them, and started to move all of our supplies onto only a few of the animals.

He told us we would have to be quick if we were to find what we sought, and we couldn’t do that with a trail of animals behind us.

He used that word a lot, ‘quick.’ I tried to explain to him that a methodical search would be more effective, but he just continued to mutter it. Eventually I relented. Much as I was going to dislike Raleigh as a person, he raised (sigh) several good points about our chances of avoiding any sort of confrontation with the Xavante, and Jack was quick to voice his support.

So it was that at the death of May, myself, Jack, and Raleigh set off deeper into the jungle. Alone.

That night the mosquitos were out in force, thick with fever, and hungry for our blood. I did my best to simply ignore them, safe as I was in my net. But over in Raleigh’s tent I kept hearing a sporadic thumping, or clapping sound, as if he were killing them with his bare hands. When I asked him about it the next day, he simply told me he had inside him a strong and enduring hatred of bloodsuckers.

Jack nodded, as if the statement were in some way profound, but I didn’t know what to say to it.

That was the day we found the stone. Half buried, worn almost completely smooth by time and exposure, but still clearly covered in those same hieroglyphics as I had seen in da Silva’s manuscript.

I was overjoyed, almost to the point of weeping: I had been right.

Jack clapped me on the back and started making some sketches of the symbols. Raleigh was silent, staring at our discovery with a look I’d never seen before. He didn’t blink for almost two minutes. Then, he gradually, painstakingly, lowered his head until his face was right next to the rough stone surface. He took several long breaths, as if sniffing the thing. And then I thought I saw his tongue shoot out, just for a moment, and taste the air around it.

Without a word, he took off into the jungle at a dead run. Myself and Jack, startled for a moment, quickly followed. Raleigh was quick, but the uneven jungle floor and terrain made moving difficult, so we were able to keep him in sight until he stopped short.

I caught up with him, breathless from exhaustion, and asked him what in God’s name he thought he was doing.

“We’re close,” he said. “I can smell it. I won’t let it get away again.”

I told him I didn’t understand, that we were looking for a ruined city, that it couldn’t “get away.” But Raleigh just repeated himself: “I can smell it,” and to my dismay, I could see Jack nodding along.

This was where things started to turn, and my memory begins to fragment. I kept a journal, but the entries… were sporadic. And shaky.

The dates no longer make sense; at some point I realized that there were no animals around us anymore, that the Amazon had become strangely quiet. But I don’t know whether this was before or after I found the pile of dead birds in Raleigh’s tent. It must have been before, but my journal is not clear on the matter. What I do know is that we kept going deeper, and deeper, into the jungle. Jack had taken over the compass and sextant by that point, and I had little idea where we were actually going

Raleigh no longer slept, of this I was sure, and the inconvenience of setting up camp was clearly starting to grate on him.

I no longer had any fear of meeting the Xavante, as I somehow knew that, wherever we were, it was no longer in territory they would want to claim.

There were other animals, now. I could never get more than a glimpse. But they were not the birds, or the mule, or any of Raleigh’s other victims. They were far too sharp for that.

And they were definitely following us.

When we met the second expedition, it seemed like I was the only one surprised. There were almost a dozen of them, fitted with cold-weather outfits and ice-breaking equipment, and they seemed to take no heed of the thick, humid heat of the jungle. They greeted us like old friends, and Raleigh began to ask them what they had found, how their search was going, how many had made it.

I tried to say a few words, but by this point I was so disorientated, so out of step with whatever path the expedition was treading, that even if they could hear me, it was clear they had no intention of listening. The leader of the second expedition, a man in a thick seal-skin coat, was talking excitedly about their progress, about their hunt for the Northwest Passage, and I realized with a start that this man was John Franklin, famed polar explorer, whose ships, the Terror and the Erebus, had been trapped in the ice and lost in northern Canada. The crews had disappeared, and many believed that they had resorted to cannibalism.

Of course, that seemed far less of a concern to me at that moment than the fact that John Franklin’s expedition had taken place almost a hundred years previous.

There was no way these people could be real, no way they could be here. But they were solid enough, and the gleam and obsession in their eyes matched Raleigh’s exactly. Jack looked on in awe at both of them.

We were briefly fourteen people, but then the things that had been following us attacked in the night. I awoke to screams and gunfire, the scents of blood and death. Something more cunning than a jaguar tore through my tent, teeth eager to find my throat. And it was only my paranoia, at the other members of the expanded expedition, that had kept my revolver close enough that I survived the struggle.

When it was over and the beasts were dead or driven off, I heard a sound that chilled me more than the vicious screams of the predators: The blood-drunk cheering of the survivors, a sound of triumph, elation, and cruelty. There were six of us left, and I reloaded my pistol before I returned to my bed.

The world was changing with every day we marched forward, feverishly hunting for a destination I was no longer sure of.

Raleigh hadn’t mentioned the city of Z for days, and Franklin at no point indicated any destination other than the Northwest Passage, though he walked through the heart of Brazil.

And now the very trees seemed to be fleeing us, branches and trunks bending away as we passed, save for those that sharpened themselves and stretched towards us. There were things moving through the trees now that looked at first like men, but they did not move like them. Their mouths never opened, but I knew there was something dreadful about them.

There was a grotesque absurdism to it all, and I sometimes thought I might burst out laughing, though I knew it would quickly change to sobbing, and I would be exposed. I had felt my safest option was to feign that same obsession that gripped Raleigh, that had taken my son. Though they both seemed to have a clearer idea of exactly what was going on, they didn’t question me too closely as long as I seemed to share it.

For all my navigational and cartographic skill, I had not the faintest idea where we were. At times, the position of the sun cast doubt on even the continent through which we traveled. We found Eduard von Toll a few days later. I recognized him immediately, as he had always been an inspiration of mine, right up until he and his ship, the Zarya, had vanished while hunting for the mysterious polar island Zemlya Sannikova. Now, he and his crew were pinning the things that looked like men to trees, with long, iron spikes. They thrashed, and struggled, and a long, bulbous tongue hung from their throats, pinned by the iron of von Toll’s men.

“I cannot stand bloodsuckers,” Raleigh said approvingly, as he conversed quietly with Baron von Toll in French.

Two of the figures pinned to the trees screamed in pain. They had no tongue, no distended belly filled with stolen blood. But no one seemed to notice, or if they did notice, no one cared. In the joy of the hunt, they had been seized. And that was that.

And so the expedition began again, with no sign of progress or clear destination, only the pure focus and wild excitement to find… It. Whatever ‘It’ was, wherever ‘It’ might be, they would not stop, would never stop until ‘It’ was found and taken.

The supplies had run out days ago, and it was becoming clear that zeal will only sustain you so far, as one or two of the group began to falter and fall from exhaustion and hunger. They were simply left behind.

The most painful part was Jack, who would spend hours walking beside me, telling me of all the wonders we would see, all the delights we would be part of, when we finally found It. Or caught It. Or killed It. Whatever It might have been. Broke my heart to see what I had done to him, to know where my path had set him.

When I finally felt my own body give out, it was a relief almost too acute to describe. I fell, and they left me behind.

I awoke back in Dead Horse Camp. Some of the Kalabolos had found me collapsed in the forest and had taken pity on me. I won’t bore you with the details of my fevers and suffering, save to say that the shell-shock I received in the Great War was nothing to what I went through after my return.

I have been careful, though. Nobody knows I am alive, and I desperately wish to keep it that way. I am sure, deep within myself, that what Raleigh Rimmell hunted out in that jungle he will never find. He can never find.

What those people pursued, what I pursued, doesn’t exist, and I dearly hope that no others will ever suffer for our obsession. The sooner the world forgets them, forgets me, the better. I just wish I hadn’t lost my son to learn that lesson.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

(pause, deep breath) What d’you make of that, then?

DAISY
Dunno. Why?

ARCHIVIST
Oh, well.. you’re uh, you’re a Hunter, right? Won’t –

[Daisy growls a sigh over his words.]
ARCHIVIST
I – just wondered. I’ve been looking for evidence of a, a Hunt ritual. To see if it was one of the rituals Gertrude stopped. And this is the closest thing I’ve been able to find.

DAISY
Could’ve been one. I think.

ARCHIVIST
But it didn’t work. I don’t even know how it was meant to work.

DAISY
No.

ARCHIVIST
But why? There was no outside interference, no other powers; even the indigenous tribes who could theoretically have derailed it seemed to stay away. So why didn’t it work?

DAISY
I don’t – think it was about that.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not sure I understand.

DAISY
Just a feeling. When I was – (struggles for words) You know what my least favorite part of a case was?

ARCHIVIST
Police brutality lawsuit?

DAISY
(exasperated laugh-sigh) Arresting them. I hated the handcuffs, the, the click. It meant the chase was done, the hunt was over. Satisfying, on a good day, sure, but moreish. I never really wanted it to be over.

ARCHIVIST
Hm. (inhale) You don’t think the Hunt would let its ritual end. You don’t think it would let them find the – culmination.

DAISY
Don’t know. Maybe? Sometimes I lost purpose because I let myself get too into it. Gave them openings just because I wanted to keep chasing. Like with you.

[The Archivist hms.]
DAISY
Sometimes (sigh) it meant I lost them.

ARCHIVIST
Uh, one of the bits I’ve managed to decode from Gertrude’s notes – it references something she calls the, uh, the Everchase.

[As he speaks, Daisy’s breathing becomes a bit heavier in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
You think that might be it, the, the ritual that never ends, because the Hunt’s all in the pursuit.

DAISY
I-I don’t know. You’re the expert.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) No, no. I-I-I like it; it’s a, it’s a good theory.

DAISY
Basira said you could just – know all this now, anyway.

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Yeah, it’s – I-I can’t really control it.

[The door opens.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh.

BASIRA
(surprised) Hey. There you are. You’re meant to be doing your exercises.

DAISY
You were out.

BASIRA
You could have done them alone.

[A slight pause.]
DAISY
Sure.

ARCHIVIST
Everything alright?

BASIRA
Yeah – Daisy, could you give us a minute?

DAISY
Oh. (slight pause) Should I –?

BASIRA
Yeah, please.

[A soft sigh from Daisy.]
DAISY
Sure.

[She leaves, closing the door behind her.]
ARCHIVIST
Are – Are you…?

BASIRA
John, is that her?

ARCHIVIST
What?

BASIRA
You’ve had people switch before, right? Replaced.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, s-sure, but –

BASIRA
How sure are you that’s the real Daisy?

ARCHIVIST
Uh – I-I’m sure, Basira; tha-that’s her.

BASIRA
But do you – (slight pause) Do you know?

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Yes. Why?

BASIRA
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
Talk to me Basira; is she – wrong in some way?

BASIRA
No. No, she still sounds like her. Says things Daisy would say, laughs like her. She just seems… lost.

[Pause.]
BASIRA
I want it to be her.

ARCHIVIST
Do you?

BASIRA
’s that supposed to mean?

ARCHIVIST
(sighs) She’s.. trying to keep a clear head. Stay away from the Hunt as much as possible. You… valued her purpose. Her resolve.

(slight pause) The sort of things…

BASIRA
(stop talking) I get it. It’s her.

[Beat.]
ARCHIVIST
We’ve all changed, Basira.

BASIRA
Yeah, I just – I didn’t realize she’d change into someone who can’t look after herself. (inhale) Even without the muscle atrophy –

ARCHIVIST
You were hoping for a defender.

BASIRA
I was hoping for someone I can trust to share the load. Because right now, it’s all on me.

ARCHIVIST
(inhale) It doesn’t have to be.

BASIRA
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
You’re not happy she’s back.

BASIRA
I didn’t say that, John. I will never abandon Daisy, and… having her back is… (she sighs) But right now she’s dead weight, and I need to be able to travel light.

ARCHIVIST
You’re starting to sound like Gertrude.

BASIRA
Good. Far as I can see, Gertrude Robinson was the most effective person in this place.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
That’s what Tim said as well.

(pause) Look, I’ve been where you are.

BASIRA
Have you?

ARCHIVIST
(with vigor) Yes, I have. You’re the only one responsible for everyone, the weight of all their lives on your shoulders – it leads to bad decisions.

BASIRA
Yeah, well, when I get myself kidnapped three times in a row, maybe I’ll look to you for advice.

ARCHIVIST
Bad decisions, like wasting three weeks chasing dead-ends and false leads rather than talking to us about the plan.

BASIRA
I told you not to look in my head.

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t. This one’s just me. You’ve not mentioned anything about where you were, avoided talking about what you might have learned, and that file that you were studying clippings from – empty.

BASIRA
Maybe I found something and I’m not sharing.

ARCHIVIST
You didn’t though, did you?

BASIRA
I had good intelligence.

ARCHIVIST
Which you charged off to investigate without telling anyone. You know who that reminds me of?

BASIRA
(inhale) Drop it.

ARCHIVIST
(…sigh) Fine. I don’t care if you trust me, but I think I’ve proven at the very least that I’m useful. So use me.

(inhale) Because if you go it alone, you are going to die. Even Gertrude worked with people. We make bad decisions when we don’t communicate.

[Basira sighs at his last words, loudly and heavily.]
BASIRA
You literally jumped into a spooky coffin without telling anybody.

ARCHIVIST
…Case in point.

[Pause.]
BASIRA
(sigh) Okay.

ARCHIVIST
And give Daisy a break. She was there eight months. (breath) I was only in there for three days, and –

BASIRA
Yeah, I know. I just…

ARCHIVIST
What?

[Slight pause.]
BASIRA
Nothing. I’ve got work to do.

[The Archivist sighs deeply as Basira leaves the room, door opening and closing with her.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]

[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
MARTIN
Right. (inhale) Martin Blackwood, archi–

[He stops. Sighs.]
Assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute. Recording statement number 0060122. Statement of Adelard Dekker,

[He seems to falter, slightly, when he says the name, possibly in recognition.]
taken from a letter to Gertrude Robinson, dated 22nd January, 2006.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
Gertrude. Sorry I can’t be there in person to go over all this with you. I – still have a few things to clear up over here.

But I thought it would be best to let you know as soon as possible. I am now certain my theory is correct. There is something new emerging. A fifteenth Power.

I didn’t want to believe it either, not at first, but I was alerted a few months ago to the case of a woman named Bernadette Delcour. She works at the Faculté de Théologie, in the University of Lyon, and is an expert in eschatology, specifically failed apocalypse predictions. She had an encounter I believe is directly connected to the new emergence, and I managed to track her down. She was reluctant to talk, though I eventually managed to get the story out of her.

Bernadette had, apparently, received a call from a colleague in Paris about a discovery regarding Garland Hillier. Now, Hillier was a member of the Millerite movement, in upstate New York during the early 1840s. I don’t know how familiar you are with the Millerites, but they would eventually grow into the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

They followed a preacher named William Miller, who believed he had calculated exactly when the end of days was coming, and pinned it down to October 22nd, 1844.

Now, Gertrude, I’m sure you’ll have noticed that date came and went without any sign of Jesus returning, and Miller’s followers noticed the very same thing, calling it “The Great Disappointment.” Most of his followers stuck with him, and gradually turned into the Seventh-day Adventists, but Garland Hillier apparently took it harder than most, abandoning the movement and returning to his native France the following year.

He spent the next twenty years publishing widely derided collections of poetry, as well as essays on belief and atheism that were roundly ignored by the philosophical salons of the time. He was supported by several literary friends, as he was reputedly a gifted editor, even if his own work was often all but incomprehensible. Garland Hillier’s final essay, published in 1867, and simply titled “L’Avenir,” “The Future,” was supposedly a rambling and meandering speculation on the end of the human race, influenced by Darwin’s recent publication of The Origin of the Species, and his own shattered faith.

He posited a future where, far from any glorious or holy revelation or reckoning, a decadent and corrupt humanity was violently and utterly supplanted, and wiped out by a new category of being. One he referred to as “Les héritiers.” The Inheritors.

He gave no details on how he believed they might look like, or how they might behave, but his predictions for the final days of humanity were unpleasant and visceral.

The piece was not popular, or widely distributed at the time, and has, for the most part, been utterly forgotten by history. I’ve been unable to find any accessible copy myself, and have had to rely largely on Professor Delcour’s recollections of its contents, as she has the dubious distinction of being one of the few academics familiar with Hillier’s work.

Anyway, the point is that sometime after that essay was published, Garland Hillier disappeared. Exactly when this happened, no one is really sure, but the last records of his existence can be found near the end of 1867. No contemporaries commented on his disappearance, nor was there any search inquiry. But neither is there any record of his death or indication of emigration or travel.

Despite his dubious academic credentials, he was apparently a man who consistently attempted to court the public eye, and his disappearance has long been a puzzlement, if not a full-blown mystery, in certain academic circles for a long time.

So it’s probably not surprising that when Bernadette got a call from Paris telling her that some workman had discovered Garland Hillier’s apartment, it got her on a train almost immediately.

And it certainly was a discovery, in the most literal sense. On the fifth floor of an apartment building on the Rue Lagarde, near the Panthéon, some construction workers had uncovered a door that had at some point in the past been completely plastered over. Removing the covering and breaking through the old wood revealed another apartment, one apparently unnoticed by any of the other residents, or, indeed, the owners of those sections of the building, each of which had assumed the space was owned by one of the others, and connected to a different part.

As far as anyone was able to determine, the apartment had been sitting there, sealed and undisturbed, for almost a hundred and fifty years. It was untouched. Pristine. With barely a thin layer of fine dust coating the possessions and belongings that had stayed there for so long. A few objects identified the place as belonging to Hillier, including a short journal, and so the local authority, baffled as to what to do with this find, had called a history professor from the Sorbonne, who had passed it off to Bernadette, as she was one of the few academics familiar with Hillier.

She went immediately. While the confusion over legal ownership would probably keep the place in limbo for some time, Bernadette was also acutely aware that it meant there would be limited protections in place as well, and she was keen to see it before anything too drastic happened to it.

She got her wish, and her colleague even managed to supply her with a photocopy of the journal, though it made little real sense. It talked of Garland Hillier’s ‘new revelation,’ about the absolute change of the world in terms that seemed at first elegiac, but later seemed – almost panicked, with the final entry simply repeating the words “La porte est la porte.”

The door is the door.

Clearly his mental state had been in decline, and Bernadette said she could not help dwelling on the image of this poor man, his whole world shifting and falling away from him, lost and alone in his tiny apartment, gradually losing himself until at last, he lay down, and simply did not get up again.

But that couldn’t be the case, she knew, as there had been no sign of a body.

Bernadette arrived, and got into the building without any trouble, save for the five flights of stairs that needed to be climbed, and found the door unlocked. Monsieur Pinard, who had been supposed to meet her there, was apparently nowhere to be found, so she simply let herself in.

The place felt strange, she told me. Like a tiny pocket of another time. A bubble, where the world had never changed. And stepping inside she almost felt like she would never change, either. Even the light that came through the window seemed to be of a different quality, muted, and gentle. The street chatter of Paris, which usually reaches all but the most remote of windows seemed to vanish entirely. There was a sense of peace to it all, shot through with a strand of disquiet, a wrongness she told me she could not identify, but she could almost smell it.

The objects left within the room itself were, unfortunately, somewhat disappointing. While the clothes and household objects were in a remarkable state of preservation, none gave any insight into the life or fate of Garland Hillier. The bed was unmade, but seemed to hold no clues, and aside from the journal, there were no papers in the place that gave any useful information, save for a few letters from Hachette and the like, declining to print his essays.

All in all, Bernadette described it as intensely disappointing, at least from her perspective, since the only aspect that served to shed any further light on Hillier – his theology or his fate – seemed to be the journal, something she hadn’t needed to spend an hour and a half on the train to get to.

She turned to leave, and that, she says, is when she started to get the sense that something was wrong.

The door had been damaged by the builders who uncovered the place, and there were several distinct gaps in the wood, but as she walked back out, the door appeared to be whole.

She ignored it, and left anyways, trying to reason it all as a strange quirk of memory. Just “one of those things.”

Unfortunately for her, it was not the only thing that had changed. The walls of the stairwell were discolored, as though covered with a dusting of some faint yellowish dirt, and the stone steps were ever so slightly sticky beneath her shoes.

There was no sound, no sign of life other than the squeaking of leather as she descended, trying desperately to convince herself that nothing was wrong. That it had been just as quiet on the way up. That this building had always had a thick, humid feeling to the air.

When she stepped outside into the street of corpses, that was when her mind could no longer deny that she was not in any Paris that she knew, no matter what the architecture might have looked like.

There were hundreds of them, stood in place where they had died. Some fallen, a few kneeling. They were stiff, and desiccated, mummified by some process Bernadette could not begin to guess at, but that rendered their flesh like tightly packed ash. At least that’s what it looked like, as she dared not touch them. Those that had fallen seemed to have f-fused with the street, and some of it seemed to have been too close to nearby walls, were embedded within them.

Every single shriveled ashened face was contorted in a scream of agony, every sharp and jutting jaw cracked and twisted in an expression of horror. Of understanding not just of their death, but the end of everything they knew. It was clear that they had been this way for years, if not decades.

Bernadette says she was sure nothing had moved in that dead city for a hundred years. She was mistaken.

I have never envied you your position, Gertrude. I have never coveted your gifts, as I know the terrible costs that come with them. But honestly, trying to get a description of these… things, these… Inheritors from Bernadette Delcour made me wish I could just pull the image from her lips, like you would have been able to. In the end, she would say nothing of them, except that “there is nothing done in the history of humanity that deserves the things that come after us.”

She was more precise on her escape. Remembering Hillier’s words about the door, she had just enough time to retreat back to the apartment and barricade herself inside. Then, she waited until the entrance changed again, and she could emerge back into the world she remembered.

At least – that’s my interpretation of events. She was rather agitated by this point in the account, so – I believed it best to leave her to it. I may try to interview her again, later, though I have my suspicions she may find herself disappearing. She has that quality about her; I’m sure you know what I mean. O-of an unfinished meal. And I can only hope that when the second course starts, she can find her way back to Garland Hillier’s apartment once more. But of course the evidence suggests that, in the end, even he wasn’t able to.

Now, I know what you’re going to say, Gertrude. Odd doors are a sign of the Spiral; empty worlds tend towards the Lonely; and eschatology is almost literally the study of the End.

But this is different. I feel it. This fear is new. This is a fear of extinction. Of change. It used to be part of the End, perhaps; when the end of humanity was to be the end of all things. But now – th-the fear is not of a rapture or a revelation. It is of catastrophic change. A change in our world that will wipe out what it means to be us, and leave something else in its place.

Mankind will warp the world so much it kills us all, and leaves only a thousand years of plastic behind. Technology will strip us of what it means to be human, and leave us something alien and cold. We will press a button that in a moment will destroy everything we have ever been. Animals are witnessing the end of their entire species within a single generation. These are new fears, Gertrude, and a new power is rising to consume them. The Extinction. The Terrible Change. The Future-Without-Us.

I know you don’t credit my theories, and I’m sure you’ll have plenty to say on this one, but I’m going to need your help with this at some point, I’m sure of it. I don’t know how you can stop the birth of something that has no life, or mind, or… substance, but if anyone can figure it out, it’s you. I’ve never met anyone so gifted at understanding that – strange dream-logic of the fears, and if what I suspect about this new power is true, it could be catastrophic.

Until then, (inhale) I’ll keep searching for evidence, (sigh) trying to find instances and manifestations of the Extinction.

I’ll keep you updated. Stay safe.

Adelard.

[Martin sighs, statement over. Immediately, from the distance, the signature static of Peter Lukas roars in.]
MARTIN
So that’s it, is it?

PETER
It is.

[A couple of footfalls in the distance coming closer.]
MARTIN
A new power.

PETER
The Extinction, yes.

MARTIN
So – (sigh) – so what, you’re afraid of the competition?

PETER
Not at all. Honestly, that’s the sort of thing I normally relish; I’ve always been a little bit of a gambler, and the higher the stakes the better.

MARTIN
So – So this is, what?

PETER
This is different.

MARTIN
(sigh) I’m listening.

PETER
Good. It’s about time.

[Martin exhales.]
PETER
There are two powers that, to my knowledge, have never attempted to fully manifest. Never had followers set them up for a ritual. Mother of Puppets, and Terminus. The Web and the End.

The Web, I’ve never really been sure about. If I were to guess, I would say it actually prefers the world as is: playing everyone against each other. And so on.

The End, on the other hand… The End doesn’t really need one. It knows that it gets everything eventually, so why bother? The End manifesting would not be a new world of terror; it would be a lifeless world. Devoid of everything.

MARTIN
Including fear.

PETER
Exactly. It has no reason to truly attempt to enter our world; it’s – passive. But the Extinction… The Extinction is… different. It’s – active; it will seek to create a lifeless world, in a way that none of the other powers ever would. Some interpretations suggest it might replace us with something new – that can then fear annihilation in turn.

But I, and those like me, would rather that did not happen.

MARTIN
S-S-so, what, you want to – stop it being – born?

PETER
I don’t know if such a thing is even possible, but if it is, then yes. Or at the very least weaken it.

MARTIN
Okay, m, okay, so – so let’s say – for now – that I believe you. Hypothetically. Wh-what does this have to do with me?

PETER
I’m still working out some of the kinks, but I believe I have a plan. However, it requires this place, and it requires someone touched by the Beholding. Elias was, perhaps unsurprisingly, unwilling to help.

MARTIN
(unamused) And you thought that since I’m so lonely already, I’d be ideal.

PETER
Yes!

MARTIN
You see – The thing is, Peter, I’m still not all that keen on being a part of any ritual you set up. You know – In fact, if I were to be blunt, I’d say that it would be suicidally stupid.

PETER
(patronizing) Martin. It’s going to be decades, if not centuries, before I get another chance to bring Forsaken into this world. (deep inhale) Your last Archivist saw to that. Honestly, if Elias hadn’t killed that woman, I’d have been very tempted. I warned him she was danger, but he was always –

MARTIN
(overlapping) Peter, Peter!

PETER
(low) Anyway. (normal) The point is that yes, obviously, if I last that long, I’m going to try again. But I’m rather keen for the world not to end in the meantime?

[Martin hms, lets out a long sigh.]
PETER
Martin, this is what we agreed. After the Flesh attacked, you – came to me.

[Martin sighs again.]
PETER
And I’ve held up my end of the bargain, despite your continued hesitation. Your friends have been largely untroubled by the many, many enemies that they have made.

MARTIN
What about the delivery guy? Breekon. And the coffin!

PETER
Was that its name? To be honest with you, I thought it was dead.

MARTIN
You thought wrong.

PETER
True enough. And as soon as I learned it was here, I moved to intervene. But, well, it turns out I wasn’t really needed. And as far as the coffin goes, there’s not much I can do about a bull-headed Archivist –

[Martin lets out an annoyed sound.]
PETER
– who seems hell bent on self-destruction. My powers only extend so far.

MARTIN
Mhm.

PETER
Look. I’m not going to pressure you into doing anything you don’t want to. It won’t even work unless you’re willing to commit.

In any case, I have plenty of preparations to work on myself before it’s ready. I’ll see what else I can find to help with your reservations in the meantime, okay?

Just – don’t hesitate too long? We are on a deadline after all.

MARTIN
Fine.

PETER
Right. Then if you’ll excuse me, I have a family thing to get to.

MARTIN
Are we going to talk about John?

[Slight pause.]
PETER
Do we need to?

MARTIN
I – wh–

PETER
Because to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what’s been going on with him these past couple of weeks.

MARTIN
(overlapping) Oh, oh, yeah, (scoff) sure.

PETER
Martin. My patron – hopefully our patron, someday – doesn’t give me any sort of special insights. I’m not quite the accomplished voyeur that Elias was; I have to keep tabs on things the old-fashioned way.

MARTIN
What, turning invisible and eavesdropping?

PETER
If you like. But – I’m only one person, and I can’t keep an eye on everything.

MARTIN
Or – anything, apparently.

PETER
(long sigh, exasperated) As I said, one of the last shreds of the Circus delivered a gateway into Too-Close-I-Cannot-Breathe. I went to help, but was too late. Then, your detective friend –

MARTIN
(overlapping) No, she’s not a de–

PETER
(ignoring) – left on one of Elias’s wild goose chases. Then John willfully hurled himself into the coffin. I did not intervene because thankfully, I did not agree to protect your friends from their own idiocy.

[Martin huffs.]
PETER
Though actually, he gave it more consideration than I thought he would.

MARTIN
He’s not a moron.

PETER
…If you say so. Regardless, he’s in there three days and then what do you know? He manages to pull himself out of the coffin like a grubby Jesus, and he even brings a penitent thief along, in the form of your pet murderer. Does this seem about right to you so far?

MARTIN
Yeah,

PETER
Now, from my point of view, so far, none of this has been any of my business. We have bigger concerns than this little soap opera you call an Archive.

[Disbelieving sound from Martin.]
PETER
What does – puzzle me though, and I mean that genuinely, is – why you were piling tape recorders onto the coffin while John was in there. (brief pause) It’s a question, Martin, it’s – it’s not an accusation.

MARTIN
I don’t know. And I just – felt like it might help. He’s always recording, and I thought it – it might help him… find his way out.

PETER
Interesting. Were you compelled?

MARTIN
I don’t know. Maybe? I-I, I definitely wanted to do it.

PETER
But?

[Slight pause.]
MARTIN
I’m – I’m not sure where the idea came from.

PETER
You should watch out for that. Could be something dangerous.

MARTIN
Sure.

PETER
I can’t help but notice you’re recording right now?

MARTIN
It – was a statement, alright; that’s what we do.

PETER
Anyway. Point is, I’m not your captor or your torturer. I’m not going to tell you to stop talking to him, or even saving him if it comes to it. If that’s not a decision you’re willing to make yourself, me scolding you isn’t going to help.

[Martin scoffs.]
PETER
You know what the stakes are now, and I just have to hope that you’re with me on this. Focusing on the big picture.

MARTIN
(resigned) Yeah.

PETER
Okay! Now, I really am running late, so if you don’t mind?

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, JOHN’S OFFICE]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
ARCHIVIST
Statement of Manuela Dominguez regarding her unconventional religious beliefs and their interaction with her project aboard the space station Daedalus. Original statement given July 14th, 2014. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I come to you with a warning – and an offer.

When you read this, I would consider it a great favor if you could share my words with the head of your Institute. Tell him that Maxwell Rayner sends his regards and offers – sanctuary.

A time of holy darkness is at hand, when the Eye will close forever, and in the spirit of the friendship they once shared, he offers an opportunity to surrender.

Forsake the Ceaseless Watcher, abandon your position, and you shall be spared in the blind world to come.

In this spirit of reconciliation, and to convince you of our sincerity, I offer my story, much as it may pain me to feed the sick voyeur that lurks in this place.

My parents… were very religious, fueled with a zealotry and zeal that only now I am beginning to truly understand. They believed in the immanence of Christ, descending and purging the Earth of all the inequities and sin that they saw in the world. I was brought up to believe in the light of God, his radiant, illuminating presence, and the promise that he was coming to banish the darkness forever.

It didn’t save them, of course, and when they lay there dying, I saw in their faces the fear that they had always denied, the confidence in their own salvation fading with each step closer to the end.

For a long time, I hoped that they had been right about their beliefs. I remembered in my heart that deep down they were vicious, spiteful people who used their faith to hurt others, and I fondly imagined them discovering themselves in an afterlife other than the one they had assumed as their destination.

But I no longer think of such things.

The core of their hatred was for anything they saw as… unnatural. For them, God’s creation was perfect, and all things in nature were right and proper according to his will.

Of course, there was little consistency in what they considered to be ‘natural,’ and it always seemed to fall along the lines of their own petty jealousies and pride. Anything they did not understand became unnatural, and I found myself crossing that line from an early age, although, strangely, out of everything I was, it was always my desire to pursue a scientific career that they railed against with the most energy.

I saw it as studying the natural world, learning how it worked, mapping it. They saw it as Devil-inspired pride, that tried to know and master forces that were rightfully beyond us.

Regardless, I broke with them as soon as I could, and only returned when they were dying.

Did I come to gloat? Maybe. Though more than that, I wanted to tell them of my own church, to spread the gospel that I had found, so they might die with the fear of darkness on their lips.

You see, I do not disagree with my parents’ thesis, that the true virtue of the world is in its natural state. But the natural state of the universe is darkness. Those rank, pompous balls of fire and light vomiting their radiation out into the nothing, they cannot stand against the overwhelming reality of it.

We talk about light and dark being opposites, but they are no more opposites than a gaudy paint is the opposite of the wall upon which is sits. Without light, there is darkness. But without darkness, there is nothing. We sit, upon our tiny spinning ball of dirt, desperately building our own tiny suns, our own illuminating shelters from the truth of existence, clustering around them like insects, never realizing that they rob us of the revelations that come… in the dark. That our wretched eyes bind us to this grotesque world in which we live.

“But Manuela,” they would say, “All life comes from light. The energy that sustains us is drawn from the Sun, from its warm, beautiful radiance.”

And I tell them to look again at ‘life,’ at the pain and suffering and misery that it brings with it. The nature that light gives us is corrupt and base, tearing itself into pieces, spinning to its own sick destruction. The life that is given to us by the stars, by the Sun, can barely sustain itself for a century.

Did you know that the oldest single thing on Earth given life by the light is the Great Basin bristlecone pine tree? Five thousand years, some of them have been alive. Five millennia. That’s it. That’s all. Even the longest lived of the Sun’s children can barely make it a few thousand years. Compare this to the uncountable eternity of darkness, stretching back far beyond when the sickness of an illuminated universe was thrown into existence.

If the words of my parents hold any truth, then God is the true monster, and “let there be light” the most evil words ever spoken.

It may come, then, as a little surprise, that my studies in physics led me towards dark matter and dark energy. My own theology was undeveloped back then, just the smallest of thoughts, tugging from the back of my mind, a thought experiment I was happy to occasionally indulge.

In many ways, my work back then was a betrayal of my principles, for what is research and study if not doing the work of the light, taking what is true and hidden and rendering it revealed and imperfect. Filtering it through a base and falsifying human mind as surely as the light warps the world around us.

In many ways I suppose my parents were right about it being unnatural. But it was my path to the truth, so I cannot bring myself to honestly regret it.

Dark energy. Dark matter. Dark radiation. The true holy trinity.

Almost the entirety of reality is made of them, shaped by them, moved by them, and yet they remain entirely impervious to the light.

They resist all attempts to measure and expose them, visible only in their effect upon the world, their nature guessed at, seeping through the holes in our knowledge of the cosmos.

All of those things that are believed to be ‘existence’ – matter, energy, radiation – all of them are utterly dwarfed by their dark counterparts. Which leads to an inevitable question: if the fundamental building blocks are so predominantly the dark parts, is it not the light-twisted versions of them that are the deviation, the pale reflection. Perhaps it should be matter and light mater.

But I did not come here to quibble over semantics. I came here to tell you my story, though it has perhaps become my sermon.

No matter. These thoughts, these feelings were always in my mind, and my work in physics only served to deepen them.

But it was not until I met Maxwell Rayner that I realized the deeper truth of it all. He spoke words I thought existed only in my heart, and I loved him as the soil loves the rain.

At first I thought his blindness was a gift, but he rebuked me for such thoughts. “Simply because one cannot feel the heat,” he told me, “does not mean their flesh does not burn. The light is more than simply the source of sight. It is the source of our entire venal half-existence.” And he was aware of it always.

Maxwell told me it is in our nature to fear the dark, and I could not disagree. For all my intellectual reverence of it, I could not deny that those few occasions I had found myself in full and proper darkness, my heart had trembled.

“And rightly so,” he said, “For are we not creatures born of the light, contemptible and corrupt? Surely then, this fear of confronting the pure nature of the universe is right and good. Surely this fear of the dark is the truest communion that humanity could ever hope for.”

And at his words I felt afraid, and my heart soared in terror and elation as my eyes brimmed with tears. For I knew he spoke the truth.

So we began to work together, to worship together in his church, the only church I’ve ever felt I truly belonged to. It was wonderful. And when he spoke to me of prophecy, of the movement of the heavens and the killing of the Sun, I knew I would do everything in my power to help him.

And I could. More than anyone else on Earth, he said, because of my expertise. That knowledge I had gained in defiance of the dark could finally be put to use. I was to create a focus, a black star, a new centerpoint around which a universe of purest darkness could turn. To take dark matter, dark energy, and harness it, bring it forward into a form that could be held, used… worshipped.

Scientifically, it was nonsense, of course. Dark energy and the like don’t work like that, not even remotely. But that wasn’t important. What mattered was that it felt like science, and that was all I needed; to do my work, to create the black star, would need a parody, an aping mockery of science. But it would also need the deepest of darknesses.

When I told Maxwell what I actually needed, he told me such a thing was impossible. But I insisted. And so he began his work on the Daedalus.

I don’t know how he convinced Fairchild and the Lukases to help finance the project. A life as long as his is evidently very good for one’s finances. But even so, space exploration is a whole other magnitude of expenditure.

I don’t entirely know if they were working on rituals of their own, or simply pushing the boundaries of their own fears, their masters. Either way, it was clear my two fellow astronauts were patsies, sent up there to suffer. I almost felt bad for them, but it was in most ways a relief to know I wouldn’t need to worry about them interfering with my own project.

Exactly how the launch was arranged, I couldn’t tell you, but I assume the calculations must have been done by one of ours. Otherwise, well, weight is very important when planning a launch, and it could hardly have escaped their notice that there were four people, in that rocket. Three astronauts, and one unlucky nyctophobe, sealed in a lightless box, silenced, but not sedated, apparently indistinguishable from the rest of the supplies.

I never learned his name, never needed to. He was simply a battery, a ready source of constant terror I could draw on for my experiments. However Maxwell had contrived to stop him screaming seemed most effective, and the closest I ever came to discovery was when Kilbride expressed confusion at the rate that the supplies were diminishing. It was really only the two of us, anyway, with Chilcott sealed away, having his own little breakdown, and Jan was always a bit of an idiot. So ready to believe anyone’s lies.

But I suppose I don’t need to tell you that, do I, Gertrude?

My experiments continued largely uninterrupted, pushing the boundaries of light, darkness, and fear. It was dangerous work, and more than once I got too close to the light, and it almost destroyed me.

But it didn’t.

I could regale you with the technical terms or scientific disciplines I played with and rendered meaningless, but in the end all you actually need to know is that I succeeded. A tiny, terrible sun of the pitchest black, shining beautiful darkness all around it.

By that time my colleagues had long since succumbed to the torments they were assigned, and I had no difficulty storing the Black Star securely, before pulling them onto the shuttle for the return journey.

And then the three of us returned to Earth. Just as well. The final experiment had left my battery in such a state that no amount of soundproofing could dampen the screams, and I was glad of the peace and quiet.

That’s all I really came here to say. To let you know that we had succeeded. And to make your boss an offer on behalf of Maxwell.

I suppose there is also an element of provocation here as well. Even with the loss of Darvish, we will still be victorious.

We have watched you, Gertrude. I suppose you’re used to that. But we know what you’re capable of. So consider this a challenge: I would love nothing more than to see you destroyed by the radiance of the dark sun we have created. So by all means do your worst.

Or prostrate yourself, both of you, before the Forever Blind, and perhaps you might be spared.

Maxwell and I await your decision with keen interest.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

(sigh, shaky breath) Well, that’s… concerning. I mean – the Sun’s still there, so I assume they failed. Unless they’re still waiting to attempt it. That’s not the sort of statement you give four years before you try to actually – (laugh turns into a sigh) Or is it?

The timeframes on these, uh, attempts, the-these rituals, well – (inhale) – they seem variable, to say the least.

When I try to think about it, uh –

[We hear the deep, low rumbling of the Archivist’s static as he attempts one more time to Behold. He makes a few noises of pain throughout the effort before giving up.]
ARCHIVIST
(sigh) I – It’s just… darkness. Unhelpful, but… not unexpected. (sigh) I’ll keep digging. If there is another ritual upcoming, I’ll need all the information I can get on it. I can’t believe Gertrude didn’t have a plan for it.

I hope I’m just being overcautious, that it’s – already long since dealt with but – (sigh) We’ll see.

[Short pause.]
ARCHIVIST
At least the coffin’s gone. I gave Artefact Storage some – very specific instructions, and they’ve got it solidly sealed away.

Is locking it up the right thing to do? There are other people in there. And Daisy and I got out, but…

No. (sigh) I – (sigh) I can’t think about that. Even if I could somehow be sure of recreating our escape, I, I can’t save everyone that’s been taken. I-It’s not my job to try, I – (inhale) and I can’t spend another three days in there, I just – (pause) I need to let it go. (pause)

I don’t – like interacting with the rest of the Institute these days. The way they look at me, I – I don’t know. I don’t know what they’ve heard, what the rumors going around are, but – (long inhale) They have definitely heard something. (exhale) And they can’t wait until they don’t have to talk to me anymore.

Can’t honestly say I blame them; none of this is easy. (sigh) Everyone just trying to get through as best they can. Living one day at a time. (short pause, sigh) But I can’t afford to be just living one day at a time; I need – a plan. But I don’t even know what I’m trying to achieve. And no one… (sigh) No one wants to tell me.

Hm. (inhale)

End recording.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[Pause.]
[INT. PRISON, VISITING ROOM]
ELIAS
Nice to see you again, Detective.

BASIRA
Still not a detective. Never was.

ELIAS
Oh, but everyone else seems to be getting a title these days,

[In the background we hear the sound of the door being opened.]
ELIAS
Ah, why shouldn’t you –

[Basira pounds on – the table? The wall? The door? Something rattles.]
BASIRA
Cut the shit. What are you playing at?

ELIAS
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.

BASIRA
Like hell you don’t. Every lead, a dead end. Every contact, vanished or dead. I spent three weeks bouncing all over the globe on your bad intel, because you said there was a way to bring Daisy back.

ELIAS
There was. (handcuffs rattle) It required you to be absent.

BASIRA
(sigh) You wanted him to go in there.

ELIAS
And you would never have allowed it, had you been present.

BASIRA
Why?

ELIAS
(cheek) Would you simply believe I wanted you and Daisy reunited?

BASIRA
No.

ELIAS
Fine. Consider it a test. Things are – coming, things that will need John to be far stronger and more willing to use his connection to our patron. His performance during the Unknowing was… disappointing. I needed a way to force him to harness his ability more acutely than he had before.

The coffin was a useful tool, Daisy an adequate bait.

BASIRA
Then you messed up. Way he tells it, he doesn’t know how he got out of there.

ELIAS
But he did. And his powers were no small part of it. Even if he required some assistance, they were what saved him. And he has still achieved what no one, mortal, monster, or anything in between, has ever been able to: He climbed out of the Buried.

[Handcuffs rattle.]
BASIRA
But what’s the point? You aren’t getting your ritual off from in here, so what do you need him for? (inhale) What’s so important you need him stronger?

ELIAS
I have been observing a recent increase in people and supplies being moved to the small town of Ny-Ålesund, in Svalbard. An increase which I believe may be linked to a rather desperate attempt by the People’s Church of the Divine Host to perform a crude ritual of their own. To bring their… (inhale, rattle) Mr. Pitch into the world.

BASIRA
The People’s Church? But I thought –

ELIAS
You thought the final death of Maxwell Rayner might have sufficiently derailed them? Yes, that was my hope too, but alas it would seem not.

[Various rattles as he speaks.]
BASIRA
Maxwell… You. You called in that tip, sent us out to their warehouse.

ELIAS
And now I’m sending you out again.

BASIRA
(sigh) And why the hell should I trust you this time?

ELIAS
I rather feel the real shame would be letting the entire world fall into darkness because of a single person’s wounded pride, (rattle rattle) Detective. The stakes are far too high for that kind of… indulgence.

[In the background, we hear some voice, louder than they’ve been so far, but still inaudible.]
BASIRA
(heavy breath) So what are they doing?

ELIAS
I don’t know the details. (sigh) Ny-Ålesund is a stronghold of the Dark, meaning I can’t see inside. I believe they call it the Extinguished Sun, though that’s as much as I know. If Gertrude had a plan for this one, I haven’t found it, which is why John needs to be closer to the Eye. If anyone can stop what’s happening, he can, see through the darkness etcetera.

BASIRA
And after all this, you want me to just – take it on faith and ferry John up to Norway.

ELIAS
Have you ever seen the Aurora borealis? It’s lovely this time of year. It would be a shame to lose them.

Feel free to do your own research to confirm what I’m telling you.

Just don’t take too long.

BASIRA
If you’re lying about this –

ELIAS
(can hear the smirk) You’ll kill me? I can hardly wait.

[Basira walks off.]
ELIAS
Good luck, Detective.

ARCHIVIST
Uh – not really; I was just going to record a statement. Why?

MELANIE
Well… (sigh) Daisy’s been, um… I’ve been keeping her company, uh, while, while Basira’s busy. She’s, um…

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Oh! No, I, uh, I know.

MELANIE
Well. I’ve kinda got to… uh. (inhale) I’ve got somewhere to be. Do you mind if – if she hangs around with…?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, I suppose – Not at all. She’s very welcome.

MELANIE
Great.

ARCHIVIST
If you don’t mind me asking – where are you off to?

[Unfortunately for both of them, the Archivist’s signature static rumbles low in the background as he speaks.]
MELANIE
Therapy. (surprised inhale) Wait…

ARCHIVIST
Oh – Oh god, Melanie, I, I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to –

[Melanie lets out a very annoyed, very “not this again” sigh.]
MELANIE
It’s fine. I would probably have told you eventually anyway.

ARCHIVIST
E-Even so, I shouldn’t have – I –

MELANIE
(overlapping) Just forget it.

[She sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
It’s good though. I-I’m glad you’re getting help.

MELANIE
Yes, well. We’ll see. (inhale) There’s a – a lot of crap therapists out there.

ARCHIVIST
I guess. Still. I-It is a good step.

MELANIE
I suppose.

ARCHIVIST
You going to tell them the truth?

MELANIE
I don’t know! (long, steadying breath) It’s all a bit – (fwoo-phkush sound) – you know? Uh – C-Can we drop it?

ARCHIVIST
Of course.

[Melanie opens the door and sticks her head out to call to Daisy.]
MELANIE
(to Daisy) Uh yeah, he’s – he’s fine with it, so…

[Daisy comes in.]
DAISY
Alright?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, uh – are you okay?

DAISY
Yeah.

MELANIE
Right. So, anyway – I’m – I’m running late, so, uh – thank you.

ARCHIVIST
Anytime.

[Melanie leaves, closing the door behind her.]
ARCHIVIST (CON’T)
You alright?

DAISY
Asked me that already.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Sorry.

[There’s an uncharacteristic casual happiness to his words.]
DAISY
I didn’t ask her to do that.

ARCHIVIST
B – I-I-I-It’s fine.

[Daisy exhales.]
DAISY
You’re not babysitting me, alright? I know that’s what the others think, sometimes, but that’s not it; I just – don’t like being on my own if I can help it. You know,flashbacks, panic attacks, the usual. (breath) Just trying to avoid it if I can.

ARCHIVIST
I know, Daisy. I – I do.

(exhale) It’s hard.

DAISY
Yeah, well. Don’t let me get in your way.

ARCHIVIST
Of course. (clears his throat) Statement of Alison Killala, regarding her time as friend and carer to special effects artist Neil Lagorio. Original statement given 1st December 2012. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I loved Neil. I might even have been in love with him; it’s hard to say. When there are so many emotions caught up in a single person, when they’re such a significant force in your life – it gets difficult to say what’s really there at the heart of it.

His work, his art, defined my early life, as his friendship defined the last twenty years of it. One of my earliest memories is cowering behind my mother, watching Labyrinth of the Minotaur on our tiny television, seeing the clay of the creature move and come alive in stop-motion. It terrified me. It thrilled me. It’s a moment that’s never completely left me. I’ve always had two passions: engineering and special effects. So naturally, the course of my life gradually led me towards working on animatronics. I don’t – care about the other stuff, not really. A squib’s a squib no matter how much you dress it up, and… (inhales) makeup never really wowed me. Even pyrotechnics, while… impressive and visually spectacular… They just didn’t give me the same sharp joy as making something that could move. That came alive, directed and controlled by my hand. I always felt Frankenstein should have been an engineer, not a medical student, as reading that book I couldn’t help but see myself in that obsession.

But I suppose everyone’s already done the monster as a robot, haven’t they? (heh)

And none made it move as well as Neil did in 1975 when he worked on Agents of Orion. That was one of his movies that I went back to time and again. The way the robot moved, the weight and life he managed to give each clanking, hissing step. I was fourteen when I managed to hunt down a copy on Betamax, and I just watched that scene over and over again. I was already obsessed with Neil’s work by then, mostly his sci-fi stuff from the late 70’s – Beyond Time, Under New York, The Crawling Ones, all that sort of thing. His earlier stuff I certainly enjoyed, but… for all my fondness for that – animated Minotaur, his stop-motion work never really grabbed me like his animatronics.

The way Neil tells it, he split from his partner Gabe in 1972, and sculpting for stop-motion had never really had the same charm after that.

“Besides,” he always told me, “I’m a puppeteer at heart.” And that was certainly true. Neil never really talked about his early life, but, sometimes, when the medication was kicking in, he would tell me about his training with puppets.

I could never figure out what performance school he learned at, or even if he went to one at all, but he would twist his fingers into all sort of bizarre, intricate shapes, until I could see the strings flowing over them.

“We made them dance,” he would say, wonder and nostalgia in his voice. “Oh, how we made them dance.”

Growing up an 80s cinephile and devotee of his art, I obviously had to learn to love horror. It wasn’t just his work with John Carpenter, either. It was common knowledge that Neil was deliberately seeking out darker and – more grotesque works, though no one knew why. Dead Sky, The Nightmare Children, Forty Winks – they were all in this period of his career, which culminated of course with Toy Shop. While it’s now regarded as a cult classic, I still remember the editorials of the time condemning it, and some even called it “the end of Neil Lagorio.”

I think it was too late to officially be a video nasty, but it was certainly referred to as such in the UK Press. He told me later that he just needed to get it out of his system, though I don’t know if I entirely believed him.

Whatever the case, my own relationship with him started in 1992, on the set of Jewel of the Amazon, a mid-budget effects-driven Kevin Costner vehicle. I’d been working in the industry only a couple of years by that point, and while I’d always dreamed of working with Neil Lagorio someday, it wasn’t – quite how I’d always pictured it. The production was rushed, the budget was stretched, the direction was… uninspired, and Neil seemed broadly miserable.

Despite this – or, maybe because of it – we became friends. I think we bonded on that shoot, sheltering from the rain for hours at a time, watching a soggy animatronic jaguar gradually start to rust. I had to fight every instinct inside me, everything that wanted to burst out in admiration for his work and his – profound effect on my life, but instead I chain-smoked and laughed, trying my best to come across as my hero’s peer.

What was Neil Lagorio like? The question is harder to answer than I always thought it would be. In so many ways, he was his work.

Conversations were usually about the current shoot, future projects, or the most recent films of anyone he considered worth his attention. He had no time for whatever the issue of the day was, and despised Hollywood gossip and anyone who dealt in it.

I will say that there was no… warmth to him. At all. He was not unpleasant or cruel, but beyond that you may as well have been talking to one of his steel-and-hydraulic creations.

There were two sorts of people in the world as far as Neil saw it: those who were worth his time, and those who were not, and if you were in the latter group he honestly couldn’t care if you lived or died. Not that most people could tell which side of the line they fell on. There were even days that – I wasn’t sure myself.

Sometimes, I remember, he would invite people over to his studio that I was sure he hated, for screenings of his original cuts. I was – quite jealous of this at the time, as I’d never got such an invitation. But it was probably for the best. I didn’t realize it back then, but… (sigh) Those guests… (how do I say this) …they never quite looked the same afterwards. We stayed in touch over the next few years, even worked together on The Wire Runner, his one underwhelming foray into CGI. He even kept in contact when I left to have my baby. It wasn’t planned, but while I may not have had much time for makeup and monster suits, the bodies inside of them were a… different matter.

Anyway, even once I’d sorted out childcare arrangements, I found myself… more and more unwelcome, in the industry. It wasn’t that people weren’t willing to hire me – by this point, I had a hell of a special effects resume – but the hours you were expected to be working, the way shoots were set up, the culture of drinking, networking – (sigh) – none of it was really possible alongside parenting.

I only really heard about Neil’s work from – what he told me. His disappointment at the director’s limited vision for the irradiated creatures in Eagle Falls, or his satisfaction with his latest – and, as it turned out – last foray into horror, with The Harvestmen. He’d always had a fondness for spiders, he told me, and I of course reminded him that harvestmen weren’t technically spiders.

It was around that time that he started to suffer his first symptoms. He told me later his greatest regret was not being able to finish his final film, an art house piece simply titled Dancer. He never explained what it was about, nor do I think it actually came out, in the end. By the time it was due to start shooting he’d already begun to seize up.

I became his carer a few months later. It just seemed to make sense. A frugal life, lucrative career, and prickly personality had left him with lots of money but no real support, while my life had left me in a position where I cared deeply about his wellbeing and was in desperate need of money.

Everything just – lined up so neatly.

I will say this once, and you can draw whatever conclusions you wish from it: Neil Lagorio did not have Parkinson’s disease.

He began to have difficulty moving, yes, but his mind remained razor-sharp at all times, and his growing immobility at no point seemed to cause him any pain, or discomfort. It was simply that, over the course of several years, he stopped being able to move under his own power. The doctors were never able to name it anything other than Parkinson’s, and – I’ll admit I’m no expert… But I know they were wrong.

When it started, I was worried that Neil would take the loss of his work very hard. It had been all he was for so long, surely being unable to continue would devastate him. Instead, he threw himself into a new project, one I would never have expected, but that suited my engineering background perfectly: Neil had devised a series of frames, ropes, and pulleys, to be constructed in the rooms and corridors of his home. At the end of these ropes were hooks, which slotted into harnesses, again of his own design, that he wore on his wrists, his neck, his torso, and his legs. When properly built and attached, it allowed me to move him, without a wheelchair or my own support. I could stand him up, and walk him like a puppet.

I protested of course; this man was my hero, I loved him, and there was no way I could subject him to this – awful indignity. But my objections were ignored, as always, and Neil insisted that this was what he wanted.

So I built that – strange contraption, using the skills I had developed across my whole life, to fill every corner of Neil Lagorio’s house with wood and steel and cable. And when it was all done, and I pulled him through his first jerky, standing motions, it did seem to make him happy. Pulling on those levers and cords, moving him step by stiff-limbed step through his house – it was the first time I had seen Neil smile in years.

And so that became our life. For almost a decade, I went to his home every day, strapped him up, and gradually puppeted my idol through whatever strange, parodied version of domestic life he desired.

I still had to feed him, had to wash him, but he would always insist that his arm be hoisted to his mouth before I fed him a sandwich, or that I correctly position him in the bath. And gradually the surreal gave way to the mundane, and it simply became… our life. I barely even noticed when the harnesses were no longer necessary, when the loops for those hooks were now embedded directly into his body. I must have asked him about it, but at the time it just seemed like – such a natural progression.

It was almost six months ago when the woman came to our door. She looked like a film student, and at first I took her for a fan. Neil’s work wasn’t the sort to attract adoring masses, but occasionally admirers would find their way to his home. Usually he’d send them away, but sometimes he’d have them wait in the atrium while I positioned him in his studio, ready for a short meeting or Q-and-A session.

I was about to ask her to wait while I checked with him, but as I started to speak she turned her head, revealing a mass of white thread criss-crossing all over the side of her temple, standing starkly against the dark brown of her skin.

She told me to sit down, and I did. I heard the levers and pulleys move behind me, and I could tell that Neil was being walked down the corridor towards this woman, but I couldn’t see. I couldn’t turn my head. So I don’t really know what his reaction was. But it didn’t sound like one of fear, or despair. He called her ‘Annabelle,’ and she sent me to his screening room. She told me I was to watch his original cuts. “Just until we’re all done here,” she said.

And as I walked away from Neil, the last time I saw him alive, he was dancing, the cables shifting and moving him in a graceful, sweeping ballet. And he was crying with joy.

I don’t know how long I was watching those films. I don’t – It was hard to keep track of time. According to my daughter, I was missing for five months. When Annabelle let me out, Neil was dead. He was hanging there, wrapped in his strings like a cocoon, twisting gently around, and around, and around.

She told me to take the films, his original cuts. She told me to come here. She told me to give them to you. I resisted for some time, but I’m done now. She’s won. And I’d – very much like to go home.

ARCHIVIST
(sharp intake of breath) Statement ends. (exhale) Hm. Neil Lagorio. You ever see any of his work?

DAISY
No. Not really into films.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Mm, they were… Well, let’s just say it’s not a complete shock there was something unnatural to them. Didn’t know we had copies in the Institute, though, let alone original cuts.

[He laughs.]
ARCHIVIST
Records indicate they ended up in… (paper flips) Artefact Storage.

DAISY
Probably best they stay there.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. (inhale) Yes, of course.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Annabelle Cane, though… She worries me – I – I don’t know. This is the second time she’s turned up, uh… Peripheral to the Institute?

DAISY
That you know of.

ARCHIVIST
Meaning what?

DAISY
(sigh) She’s Web. Spider’s sneaky like that. Like that lighter you’re always using; where’d you get that?

ARCHIVIST
Mm. Good point. We should keep our eyes open. Anyways – How’s Basira doing? I haven’t seen her much since – (inhale) Well, she seemed a bit tense the last few times we spoke. (cautiously) How are you guys doing?

DAISY
(overlapping, clears throat) N-No, Basira she’s – she’s been good. We’re together, so it’s good, (sigh) if she didn’t keep treating me like a china doll. (inhale, exhale over speaking) But it’s alright.

ARCHIVIST
That’s understandable, I suppose.

DAISY
(sigh) Yeah, well – (sigh) What do you think? You think I’m weak, just – (sigh) – ‘cause I’m not already chasing the next kill? You think I’m less me?

ARCHIVIST
I – (sigh) I don’t feel like I’m exactly in the best place to judge the… intersection between free will and humanity. (stuttering inhale) I’m still trying to figure that out myself.

DAISY
John… When you went in the coffin, was it you choosing to do that? Did you actually think you could save me, or was that something telling you to do it?

ARCHIVIST
It was me. I was – drawn to it, I’ll admit, but it was my decision. It wasn’t entirely about you, though.

[He sighs as he says those last words.]
DAISY
What was it?

ARCHIVIST
My – (large sigh) My memories of the coma are not clear, but I know I made a choice; I made a choice to become… something else. Because I was afraid to die. But ever since then, I – I don’t know if I made the right decision; I’m stronger now, tougher, I can – (he cuts himself off) If I do die, now, or get sealed away somewhere forever? I don’t know if that’s a bad thing. And I don’t want to lose anyone else, so if I can maybe – stop that happening, and the only danger is to me, I – I’ll do it in a heartbeat; worst case scenario, the universe loses another monster.

DAISY
That’s messed up.

[The Archivist lets out a laugh.]
ARCHIVIST
(inhale) Yeah. I suppose it is.

DAISY
Did you know the coffin wouldn’t kill you?

ARCHIVIST
I – guess I thought imprisonment wouldn’t – wouldn’t be as bad as it was.

[Daisy sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
And it’s a lot easier to make that choice than it is to actually endure the result; you might have noticed when I was in there with you I… I had regrets.

DAISY
Yeah. I remember.

ARCHIVIST
Plus I thought – (pause, small sigh) Well, I didn’t know what being down there had done to you.

DAISY
(slight intake of breath) You thought I was gonna kill you?

ARCHIVIST
It was a possibility.

DAISY
Guess so.

[A short pause, silent but for the Archivist’s breathing.]
ARCHIVIST
Daisy.

DAISY
Hm?

ARCHIVIST
It, uh – hm – Is it, uh – Weird question, but – I – (sigh) I haven’t seen you in my dreams? The last couple of weeks?

DAISY
Oh, ah – No, I – I work here now. Figured it seemed to protect the others, so –

ARCHIVIST
Oh! Right, so you – wait, did you talk to Lukas, or…?

DAISY
(overlapping, hah) Broke into Elias’s old office, found an employment contract, filled it in, and signed it.

ARCHIVIST
And that worked.

DAISY
Seems so.

ARCHIVIST
And you’re not… worried about –

DAISY
Basira’s trapped here. So are you. Not like I’m going anywhere anyway.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose not. So… (sigh) No more dreams.

Not of you and your weird eyes. Just the coffin.

ARCHIVIST
Is that better?

DAISY
(fierce) It’s mine.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

DAISY
You need to stop moping.

ARCHIVIST
(the picture of Edwardian offense) I what?

DAISY
You need to stop swanning around, being all sad.

ARCHIVIST
I – I’m not swanning around -

DAISY (OVERLAPPING)
“Boo-hoo, I’m so alone and a monster.”

ARCHIVIST
I am alone. Martin is –

DAISY
Busy doing paperwork. Not like he’s dead. Besides, he’s not the only other person here, you know. There’s me, Melanie, Basira –

ARCHIVIST
Traumatized, traumatized, and paranoid because of me.

DAISY
(give me strength) Get over yourself! You’re always talking about choices; we all made ours. Now I’m making a choice to get some drinks in. Coming?

ARCHIVIST
(wha?) I – I don’t – I – (slight pause, he grapples with the concept of friendship) Yeah, okay.

DAISY
Melanie’s out. But I’ll go get Basira.

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Is she – W-Will she want to join us?

DAISY
(darkly) If she doesn’t, I’ll rip her throat out.

ARCHIVIST
Uhhh…

DAISY
It’s a joke, John.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Haha! (soft) Yes. I – I-I’ll get my coat.

Case 9550307, Wallis Turner. Incident occurred at the North Point prisoner-of-war camp, then later the sunken ship Nemesis, in late 1942. Statement taken 3rd of July, 1955 at the Pu Songling Research Centre, Beijing. Committed to tape 9th of October, 2014. Gertrude Robinson recording.

GERTRUDE (STATEMENT)
I always knew what sort of a thing war was. Even when everything was going to hell, even when it just plain stopped making sense, and what I was seeing and hearing was obviously ghosts and monsters – even then it still didn’t surprise me. Not really.

I never wanted to join up, never cared about fighting for my country. I mean, what, like my country ever fought for me? No. No government ever gave a damn about me, and I didn’t feel like I had anything needed paying back on that front. Add to that, I was terrified. I’ll admit it, the thought of marching off to war set my whole body shaking, and I can still remember the nightmares I had when I got the notice.

I was half an inch from going conchie – going to prison and taking my lumps – but in the end it was my dad that pushed me into the uniform. And it wasn’t an argument or telling-off that did it, either. He just looked so damn proud when I told him. His son, the soldier. Don’t know if I’d ever seen him look at me like that before. And I just didn’t have the heart to break it. Me going conchie would kill him, so I had to learn to kill others.

And that’s the thing that really scared me, you know? I wasn’t scared of dying, not really. Everything dies in the end, and the chaplain says you end up with God. Who am I to say different? Even if it’s just sleep, just a quiet nothing forever, it’s not like you know enough to be bored, is it? No, death ain’t scary.

But killing, that’s scary. To look another living thing in the eyes and end it forever, strip away everything they could have been, could have done, or felt – nobody should ever have to do that. Sergeant once told me it’s no different from killing a chicken back home. But people aren’t chickens, and the idea that war strips us all down to just a body, that moves and kills, or falls and dies, makes me feel sick to my stomach.

I don’t like killing chickens, either. But none of my feelings mattered in the end. I got the uniform, the training, and the gun then ended up shipped off to the Pacific to fight the Japanese. I’ve got no desire to share the details of my service. They’re not memories I care to dwell on, and they’re certainly not why I’m here. Let’s just say that neither my noble comrades-in-arms nor the soldiers fighting for His Majesty the Emperor seemed to share my lofty ideals about the sanctity of life. Still, I got through a while without dying and even without killing anybody. That I know of, at least. I fired my gun plenty, I guess, and you don’t usually see where the bullet lands, do you?

I was captured after about six months and sent to the North Point prison camp in occupied Hong Kong. At the time it seemed like a relief, but then I hadn’t heard the stories about how the Japanese treated their POWs. I mean, these days after the Tokyo trial and everything, I, I guess everyone knows how bad it was. But I didn’t have a clue when we first surrendered.

The things people will do to their fellow man, just because someone with a shinier badge tells them to. And even then, our treatment was a picnic compared to the Chinese prisoners who came through North Point. But again, that’s not the point, and I have no interest in dwelling on the suffering. Plenty of others to tell those stories, if you want them.

I was in that place for four months – four months of hell. I know others who were in there a lot longer, and I sure don’t envy them. Though the way I got out wasn’t exactly ideal.

Leonard was the one who heard it first. He was the closest thing I had to a friend in that place: Leonard Holden, built like a barn, and about as complicated. He’d worked on a farm before signing up, and sometimes it seemed like that was about the limit of what he thought the world was. At least until the rest of the world caught up with him. Poor bastard.

We’d been captured at the same time, and the fact his head stuck out above the others meant it was easier for me to stick by him when we were all getting sorted. We pushed through those four months together, me watching him go from a hulking farm boy into a scrawny beanpole of a man. He never lost his smile, though. Not until he heard that music.

It was a cool winter night when it happened. It never got properly cold in North Point, not like back home, but you still ended shivering most of your nights away. There was the lightest of rains that night, when the Nemesis arrived.

We were trying to sleep, pushed into our cramped wooden huts, thin blankets pulled tight. At first, it was a drumbeat – distant, regular, sometimes broken by the rattling role of a snare drum. I could feel my pulse quicken, like it wanted to match the tempo, though I’ve no idea why.

I should have been confused – scared, maybe, and I guess I was, but I could also feel my fingers tap-tap-tapping away to the beat. Beside me, Leonard started to hum to himself, a tune I could almost half-remember hearing, just before the trumpet began to drift over the waters just a few yards beyond the walls.

I call it a trumpet because that’s the closest thing I can think to liken to that sound. But it sure wasn’t any trumpet they played on the parade ground. By this point we were all out of our beds and clustering around the dirt-caked windows looking out towards the water. I don’t know if any of us had any expectations of what was going to happen, but unless it was some Japanese military thing, I think we were all expecting to watch some… people… die. And we did, I guess. Just the way we thought.

There was a boat floating out there not 20 yards in the shoreline. It wasn’t like any Imperial ship I’d ever seen, but I didn’t think it belonged to our side, either. It was metal, but not like the warships I was used to. It was like an old tall ship, with tattered masts and rigging, but made entirely out of cold, black iron. I knew it was cold. It made me cold just to look at it. The whole thing shone in the moonlight, slick with water, as though it had been caught in a rainstorm, and I could see the name written in English on the prow, clear as anything: Nemesis.

It had been almost a full minute by now, and we’d still heard no response from the guards. No searchlights, no alarms, no angry shouting, none of the things that usually accompanied any sort of commotion. That should have been a good thing, right? But instead, I just felt this pit in my stomach, like I knew whatever was coming had to be really, really bad.

Just then, I saw figures moving towards the shore. Even in the dark, I could make out the uniforms of our captors, but they weren’t moving right. They were stepping slowly, walking to the rhythm of the drum, the swelling of the trumpet. In another life, another… reality, I’d almost have said they were dancing.

They kept going until they stood at the water’s edge. I counted dozens of them. It must have been every guard in the camp, or damn near it. They were still moving around each other, still shifting and stepping to the rhythm of that music, but now something was in their hands, glinting in the moonlight. Our captors held their blades tight, keeping them utterly still while their bodies moved and swayed. Then in a moment, the control broke, and they fell on each other suddenly, each crying out with unleashed ferocity.

One man severed his commander’s arm in a single swipe, before being run through the stomach by his former comrade. Two more plunged the points into each other’s eyes, pushing forward, driving them in until they both collapsed, propped up, intertwined. It only took a few seconds, and then they were all dead, and the dirt was slick with their blood, flowing down and into the water where the Nemesis floated.

When they were lying still, and the music stopped, the night was quiet again. That’s when I heard the sound that really chilled my blood: all my comrades, my fellow prisoners, cheered. And it wasn’t the cheer of those glad for freedom. It was the sound of bloodlust and cruelty.

Without any fear of the guards, we left our cramped dormitories and filed down towards the ship that all the others seemed to think was our salvation. They walked slowly, almost reverently, stepping over the bodies of our slain jailers. A few bent down, pulling long knives and bayonets from the corpses, not even bothering to wipe the trailing gore from them.

Small boats paddled over from the ship and started to ferry us over. The sailors wore old uniforms, a mess of different navies, different eras. Some I recognized from history books, others were a complete mystery to me. All of them had some telltale stain, or burn, or patch of missing cloth – something that made it clear that whoever was wearing the uniform was not the original owner.

It took several trips to transfer everybody to Nemesis, but in all that time, nobody spoke. It was surreal. My whole time as a prisoner had felt like a nightmare, but this… this felt like something else entirely.

They lined us all up on the deck, as if we were mustering for something, none of us dressed or uniformed, a few holding salvaged weapons, waiting to know what was expected of us. And the ship began to sail, out down towards the open ocean, wind and salt cutting through us as we went. My feet felt stuck to the deck, shivering, as we watched this weird mismatch of bloody sailors maneuver this thing that seemed like it belonged to the bottom of the sea. Looking around, I could see the metal was twisted and bent in places, and staring closer at the deck below, I began to notice rust and holes laced through it. There was absolutely no way that this vessel should have been floating.

After an hour, we completely lost sight of the land, and the only things beyond our ship were the rolling black waters and the hollow glow of a full moon. That was when the music started up again. We were so close now, every pulse of the drum shuddered through us.

And the trumpet notes cut through us. I could see now it was made of the same black iron as the ship, and embedded like shrapnel in the hand that held it, the lips that blew into it. Whatever spell had come over the others was gone in an instant, and I could feel the sudden terror flow out of them in a flood of unleashed fear. Some of them started to whimper. Others tried to ask questions of anyone they thought might be officers, but they were ignored, and the music just got louder.

Leonard was the first to dance. Well, I think of it as a dance, though I don’t know why. He reached over and grabbed another one of the former prisoners, a scrawny guy, I, I think his name was Milton. He gave a cry of anger that I could never have imagined coming from his gentle, smiling lips, even in the heat of battle. There was nothing Milton could do. Even malnourished as he was, it was easy for Leonard to snap his arm like a twig, twist his neck until his leg spasmed and his skull started to crack. Even when his victim was clearly dead, he kept beating it, tossing the corpse across the deck with as much ferocity as if it were the most hated man alive.

The bloody crew of the Nemesis watched, their eyes riveted, and their feet tapping to the music. Leonard’s rampage against the now-unrecognizable corpse of Milton only ended when another soldier, whose name I never knew, lept forward with that same cry of violence, and began to stab him wildly with a stolen bayonet. So it continued, hour upon hour of that night, as one-by-one the stolen prisoners succumbed to that music, their silent, frozen terror giving way in a moment to the eager desire to kill.

The crew, hungry for death in their stolen uniforms, at first cried out in joy with each new murder. Then, they cried out with expectation. And at last, with what sounded like concern, casting their eyes up into the empty sky as though waiting for something. As fewer and fewer of us remained, I could feel something like panic begin to spread through them, and I began to see the water line creeping higher and higher up the side of the ship, reaching eagerly to pull the Nemesis back down into its grave.

The whole time, I expected the music to reach me – to take me, to seize my heart with murderous purpose. But it never did. Even as the last of the other prisoners began to hack wildly at each other, and the waters started to flow over the sides and around my ankles, I never felt it.

Instead, I broke and ran, fleeing for one of the smaller boats that had ferried us from the shore. The crew did not stop me. They simply watched me with expressions of despair – the deepest disappointment I’ve ever seen.

The small craft was iron, like the larger vessel, and as the Nemesis sank finally beneath the waves again, I cut the remaining ropes and simply… floated away. I was terrified I’d be picked up by the Japanese, or die out there in the ocean, but as it was, I got lucky, and a few days later was picked up by an Allied ship. I told them my story, just like I’m telling you now. And what do you know? I got to sit out the rest of the war.

I often think about that night. But it’s not the blood I remember – not the black iron ship, or the look on Leonard Holden’s face as he pulled poor Milton apart. It’s the sadness on the faces of those who kidnapped us. Those who made us dance to their violence. I don’t think I’ll ever know what they expected to happen. But I think I’m very glad it didn’t.

GERTRUDE
Final comments.

Well, that’s quite a relief. Nearly 40 years I’d been wondering about the Slaughter’s ritual, keeping an eye out for anything that might be stirring. And it turns out I needn’t have been worried at all. The Risen War failed a few years before I was even born.

I should have known, I suppose. Few wars in my lifetime have reached anywhere near the heights of fear I suspect this ritual would need – though I did spend some time a while back looking over some details from the Cuban Missile Crisis to, heh, no avail. And all this time, the answer was just sitting in the archives of the Songling Center. Funny how that works, sometimes.

An interesting set of trappings for this one: the Opium War history of the Nemesis, uniforms linking – no doubt – to horrific crimes from every Imperial nation, all placed in the bloody heart of the Pacific Theatre. And Japanese POWs… something to do with attitudes towards surrender and atrocity in Japan at the time? The Senjinkun military code? Not my place to speculate, I suppose.

Still, the anticlimax is fascinating. I can only assume they were supposed to be bombed at the height of the ritual – maybe by Japanese aircraft, maybe Allied, maybe both. I wonder what stopped it. A Japanese radar filled with spiderwebs, a US destroyer finding itself suddenly alone in the open ocean? Heh. We’ll probably never know.

Heh, I suppose… Hah! If any of them survived the re-sinking of the Nemesis… God, they must have been kicking themselves in 1945! If they had just had a bit more patience, waited a few years, sailed her into Nagasaki Harbor instead… Still, none of us can tell the future, can we?

So, that’s nice. Another one to cross off the list. Doesn’t help with the Unknowing, though.

(sigh) Well, you still have Dekker’s back-up plan, of course, but it’s very risky. To be sure, I think the detonation would need to happen from within the Unknowing, while it was going on. Gerard may have a connection to the Eye, but I’m not convinced it would be enough. And I will admit I’ve grown… fond of the boy.

I wonder if I told him about Eric, whether he’d follow in his father’s footsteps… Still, it’s not like it kept Eric safe in the end.

Anyway, point is, you can probably discount the Slaughter. It had its chance.

So. Funny story. Turns out when Daisy broke the lock to get into Elias’s old office… well, she did a good enough job that it’s not obviously broken. So, it hasn’t been replaced yet.

So, I had a look around. Mostly as I remember, but there’s a box of tapes and statements in the corner. Obviously those Elias either didn’t feel he could trust me with yet, or maybe just the ones he was checking himself.

Ideally, I’d like to avoid tipping Peter off for as long as possible that I have access, but it turns out I don’t Know Elias’s safe combination. Not yet, anyway.

So I just took the first one that called to me, and it’s… it’s good, I suppose. Glad to know I don’t need to worry about a Slaughter ritual. Nice to get confirmation that whoever Eric was, he was Gerry’s father and, well, one assumes Mary Keay’s partner.

But nothing with any direction to it. Ever since I crawled out of that damn coffin I feel like I’ve been… adrift. Filling in blanks and diving into history, but only… The breadcrumbs I’m finding are stale. Old.

What the hell is the Watcher’s Crown? So far, the only mention of it I’ve had is from Gerry, and he didn’t seem to know much about what it actually meant. And he’s gone, now.

But if it is the grand ritual of Beholding then I – I mean, I need to know about it. Right? I feel like I’m on a deadline, like I’m running out of time, somehow. And I don’t even know where to go, what to look for, or… I’m just casting around blindly for more clues to just drop into my lap. Everyone else is running towards something or running away, and I… I don’t know what I’m doing.

I’m just tired. Think I might go lie down for a while. Get a cup of tea. Daisy’s got me listening to The Archers. I hate it. But it feels nice to hate something that can’t hurt me. I don’t know. That’s it, I, I guess.

Mhm.

ELIAS
No time for pleasantries? Very well, then. To business. What can I do for you? Tired of running budgets for Peter? I know I would be.

About any of it.

[Elias inhales heavily.]
ELIAS
Everything Peter has told you is true.

MARTIN
(huh, really?!) Oh…

ELIAS
For all his… many faults, Peter is legitimately trying to stop the end of the world as we know it.

MARTIN
So why haven’t you helped him?

ELIAS
My relationship to the apocalypse is more… complicated.

MARTIN
(overlapping sigh) Seriously?

[Rattle rattle.]
ELIAS
Seriously. Anyway, I have helped him. I’ve given him control of the Institute, I’ve provided him with –

MARTIN
Me?

ELIAS
– any manpower he might require.

[Martin scoffs: Yeah, right.]
MARTIN
(increasingly heated) Yeah, but if – if he’s right about the Extinction, what it is, then why didn’t you say anything before; why am I only hearing it about it now; and why doesn’t John know?

ELIAS
In my case, while Peter has talked of it before, it was only very recently that I was forced to admit the Extinction is real. And as for our dear Archivist, I’m afraid I no longer have any real control over what he does or does not know, unlike yourself. I notice you haven’t told him either.

MARTIN
Yeah, well. I’m still not sure I really believe it. (long exhale) A,And I don’t… I – I’m –

ELIAS
(rattle) Worried he might charge off into another coffin.

[He makes a smug little sound.]
Quite. (rattle) As for why I’ve done so little about such a looming existential threat, (sigh) to be blunt, I have been rather busy.

[Martin makes a sputtering noise that equates to: Yeah, right x2.]
Don’t forget, I – (rattle) – am still living at Her Majesty’s pleasure, due in no small part to your actions. So by this point, all I can do is confirm that everything Peter has told you is true.

[Short pause.]
MARTIN
I think he wants me to join the Lonely.

ELIAS
Then it sounds like you have a decision to make.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
What? (small dry laugh) That’s it? No, no monologue, no mind games? You love manipulating people!

ELIAS
That makes two of us.

[Rattle.]
No. This is too important for me to jeopardize with cheap – (rattle) – mind games. I simply have to trust that when the time comes, you’ll – (rattle) – make the right choice.

Great! (small sigh, under his breath) Great, great. (to Elias) So what you’re actually saying is that you’re gonna be – no help whatsoever!

[You can hear the grin in Elias’s voice when he speaks.]
ELIAS
Just like old times.

[Rattle.]

[He clears his throat.]
MARTIN (STATEMENT)
My dear Jonah,

You will forgive me, I hope, for being so forward, but I feel I must break the silence that has characterized our acquaintance for these past few decades.

You see, Jonah, I feel the hour of my death approaching, and, though you have always been reluctant to pay due heed to my warnings or counsel, I continue to see in you the reflection of my own past hubris. I could not go easy to my grave without offering one last plea for your restraint. What we built at Millbank should be left well enough alone, resigned to the nightmares of the reprobates and brigands contained within its walls.

I have been blessed with a long life, something few who cross paths with the Dread Powers can boast, but now, at the end of it, my true fear is that I have wasted it, chasing an impossible dream. To speak plain, I have begun to lose faith in the possibility of balance, of any sort of equilibrium among them.

It is telling, that of those I have brought into my confidence, it is only you and I who have continued this far without falling to one power or another, despite all my instruction and work. This is, of course, assuming you have not taken the path of the Eye that I know has called you, called us both for so long. Even since before we began our work on Millbank.

I suppose I had to believe that the darkened natures of our terror could be kept in check, weighed against each other so that the great wheel would keep turning forever, without reaching the velocity I feared would crush us. Perhaps my sin was to see them as something that could be knowable, and harnessed.

I’m sure you recall what happened with the Reform Club, but you may be unaware of some of my other experiments below the very streets of London. Places I have tried to cover with churches, of all things, in the faint hope that… perhaps the site of our Saviour will be enough to contain them. A rather feeble hope, for my own salvation.

Did I ever tell you about the dreams? I’m sure I must have. I would dream about them, you see, as a young man, long before I devised my taxonomy. I would find myself in nightmares of strange, far-off places: a field of graves, a grasping tunnel, an abattoir knee-deep in pig’s blood. I believed then, as I still believe now, that these places I saw were the Powers themselves, expressed in their truest form, far more entirely than any “secret” book can claim.

And if, as I came to believe, the Dread Powers were themselves places of some sort, then surely with the right space, the right architecture, they could be contained. Channeled. Harnessed. So yes, hubris. Not simply in that, I suppose, but in believing that those I brought into my confidence shared my lofty goals.

So many have abandoned us, casting about for rituals that I helped design. In my excited discussions with Mr. Rayner, I perhaps extrapolated too much from his talk of a grand ritual of darkness. The Dark, I thought, was simply one of the powers, so it stands to reason that each of them should have its own ritual. Perhaps they already did, even before I put pen to paper.

They certainly do now, and I shudder to think how Lukas, Scott, and the others may use this conception.

Fourteen powers, with their opposites and their allies, each with an aim no more or less than manifestation. Apocalypse. Apotheosis. I wonder, did my work bring about these dreadful things, or – did I simply develop the means by which they can be known?

I should have realized, of course, when we first discussed the Flesh, for how can there be true balance, each one to its opposite, when new fears can emerge and change as civilization itself grows and alters, when a new power can birth itself screaming from the torn remnants of others?

I know you say the Flesh was perhaps always there, shriveled and nascent until its recent growth, but to grant the existence of such a lesser power would throw everything into confusion. Would you have me separate the Corruption into insects, dirt, and disease? T,To divide the fungal bloom from the maggot? No. No, I – stand by my work, and thus, we must conclude that the only explanation is a new Power, created from what was once others, yet also distinct. And if such change is possible, how, then, can any true balance be achieved through immutable, unchanging stone?

I have been dreaming again, Jonah. The same every night for months, now. I imagine myself a boy again at Aspley. I awake, cold and alone in the dormitory. The sky outside is dark, and I see no stars. I light a candle, to better see my way, and step down the silent corridor. The master’s rooms are empty, the fire in the kitchen is dead. Eventually my steps lead out into the courtyard. It is so quiet that the sound of my feet upon the grass is painful to my ears. I stop, and look up at the sky, that empty black nothing, and I see the edges of the horizon becoming a dull white. I cannot understand what I am looking at.

And then the sky blinks.

And I awake.

I am not a fool. I know well enough what this dream is likely to mean, and I warn you again, that if you have any remaining ambitions to use our work, to try and wear the Watcher’s Crown, you must abandon them! Not simply for the sake of your own soul, but for that of the world! I have always had the utmost respect for you as a man of dignity and learning. Donot allow yourself to fall to this madness.

I have been thinking, of late, about the first origin of the Dread Powers, if such beings can really be said to have true origins. Are they eternal? Or were they created from our own fear by some – grand accident, or, worse, some grand design? I believe the latter to be the case, as you well know, for I have in vain struggled to reconcile their creation with the existence of a loving god.

They are not demons, of this I am sure, though we have drawn parallels with their acolytes and certain monstrous figures from ancient myth. No, I feel certain they were brought into existence by some – ancient civilization, some foolish tribe from pre-history.

Do you know of Alexander Cunningham? He’s been working with the viceroy of India on the Indus Valley digs, and has discovered some quite remarkable things. Burial pits full of burned bones and ash; skulls with markings, as if the eyes were removed; and others that seemed buried alive. Perhaps a dying civilization sought to harness its own terror, as we once thought to harness its results.

Of course, such things are pure conjecture. (long inhale) I have not brought Cunningham into my confidence on this, nor do I believe there will be any cause to, even if there was still time remaining to me. (soft hm) Perhaps you’re wondering why I’m so convinced of my imminent demise, and why I should see it as cause to reach out to you, after so much silence and distrust has passed between us. Certainly, you must either wonder, or you already know all too well.

I have been watched for some time, now, since shortly before the dreams began. It was subtle at first, easy to ignore and dismiss. What possible harm could there be in the idle glance of a footman, staring at you as you leave your home? And no doubt the shopkeeper is permitted to watch whomsoever he pleases within the confines of his own establishment. (inhale) So I have been reassuring myself, as I attempted to ignore my own growing disquiet.

But what is not to be dismissed is when your driver, on the long road from London, takes his eyes from the horses and begins to turn his head, slowly at first, but with a clear determination, inch by inch without ceasing, neck cracking and skin stretching, until his whole head seems as though it were placed atop his shoulders in reverse by some careless sculptor.

The others in my carriage seemed not to mark this awful sight, but I could scarce look away, and the eyes of this twisted figure locked on my own, tears streaming from their corners. It was such a dreadful spectacle that it took every ounce of my composure not to hurl myself bodily from the coach.

The journey was not a short one, and for all those hours the driver did not once for a second look away. The horses seemed to take it all in stride.

Since then, I have attempted to avoid such situations, and have traveled primarily by the railway – but, even then, it seems I cannot avoid the ceaseless gaze of those silent figures who gather along the side of the track to stare at me as I pass. I count the billowing smoke as a blessing, for though it sends me into coughing fits, it at least serves to hide me from their relentless eyes.

I am choosing to assume that these manifestations are unintentional, Jonah, and you have not simply decided to implore a dark patron to end the life of an old man. I further find myself supposing that they might emanate from your own intrigues and preparations to culminate those plans which we agreed to abandon so many decades ago.

I beg you, do not pursue this goal; if only a single lesson may be gleaned from my life of long study and longer hardship, it is that the fear of death is natural, and to flee from it will only bring greater misery. Repent of your sins, Jonah. Seek forgiveness. I am certain the Dread Powers cannot take a soul who keeps faith in the Resurrection.

As for myself, I must cling to hope, for I cannot ultimately deny the wavering of my own faith. I have pleaded with the Lord to give me strength, to help shield me from the things I have sought these many decades, to protect me, as my end draws near. I do not believe my prayers have been heard.

Last night I was awoken by a noise from the drawing room. I was in my own bed, and the moon shone through the window, casting the place in a pale and sickly hue, though it was illumination enough to assure myself I was alone. The noise came again, however, and I called out to Laura, asking if she had woken in the night. There was no reply. I struck a match, and lit my meager candle, clinging desperately to its small pinprick of warmth and light, and I crept towards the drawing room.

The door opened slowly, and the room within was in pitch darkness, the heavy curtains having been drawn across the window. In the sputtering glow of the candle, I could see a figure stood in the corner opposite the door. It wore a long nightdress, and seemed at a glance to be my dear, sweet Laura. I let out a breath and began to settle myself, asking her what she was doing out of bed. She did not respond, however. She remained silent instead, facing into the corner of the room.

I approached slowly, that restored confidence fleeing me as swiftly as it had arrived, and asked her again. This time, she began to turn, with such a slowness I was reminded instantly of the driver. I started to speak again, but at that moment my candle went out, plunging me into abject darkness. I fumbled desperately for a match, and, finding one in my nightgown, I struck it in a panic, casting a sudden light on my surroundings.

Laura’s face was inches from my own, her eyes staring into mine, so wide that they seemed to take up half her face or more, bulging grotesquely from their sockets. I screamed. Just once. She gave no response of her own.

I wanted to run, to – lock myself in my room, but under the sight of those horrible eyes, my entire body seemed to freeze, and I stood there, match held aloft, eyes locked with this awful parody of my daughter.

After an eternity, the flame reached my fingers, and I dropped the match, letting the relief of darkness wash over me. I stood there until morning, only to find Laura gone. It was then I began composing this letter.

Laura, of course, claims no knowledge of the night’s events, having no memory of even leaving her chamber. The Eye has marked me for something, of this I have no doubt. My humble hope is that it may be a swift death, an accidental effect of your own researches, which I once again implore you to abandon. It is likely too late for me, but I will not –

[Martin breaks off, flips the page over.]
MARTIN
Um… He, um… the letter ends there. Uh – apparently Robert Smirke was found collapsed in his study that evening, dead of, uh… apoplexy. Hm. I-I don’t know how the letter reached the Archives – I mean, (noncommittal sound) I can guess, but…

So. So what; what does it mean? Am I supposed to be reassured that new entities can be born, that there’s some – some kind of precedent for the Extinction?

(slight pause) Peter? (pause) Huh. Maybe he has gone to a party. (clipped exhale) Anyway.

(inhale) Smirke was clearly wrong about the Powers balancing each other, at least. I mean – i-i,it’s obviously impossible. There’s too much variation in, in how much something is feared by people any one time, an-and if that’s the case, I suppose it’s… not impossible that Peter… might be telling the truth.

I don’t know what he’s talking about when he mentions Millbank. The old prison I guess? Tim said the tunnels under the Institute were all that was left of it, but – John said he’d checked them pretty thoroughly.

(sigh) I’m not the one who knows all about this stuff. I wish – (he breaks off) N,no. No, it’s fine; I’m fine; (huff) I can do this.

(slight pause, inhale) I don’t know what Peter’s planning; my, my guess is that it might involve something below the Institute. Hopefully by the time you get these tapes I’ll have something more concrete for you.

Good luck, John; I –

Stay safe.

Statement of Eugene Vanderstock, regarding the creation of Agnes Montague, her life, care, and death. Original statement given November 30th, 2006. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Arthur asked me to tell you that Agnes Montague is dead. He asked me specifically, because he knew I’d have to write my whole bloody story down for you and it would hurt, like hell. But I talked out of turn to him, suggested that we should just burn this whole place to the ground with you inside, so I suppose this counts as my punishment.

He thinks I’m scared enough not to make good on my threats without his say-so. And he’s probably right. Just as well you’re not here. Smart move on your part. They always are, aren’t they? Smart moves. Someday you’re going to push your luck too far, and when you do… well you just better hope it isn’t Jude who comes to collect.

So, me? I was born in ‘36 – I know, I don’t look seventy, but burning the candle at all ends does have a few advantages. Until you burn out entirely, at least. It’s hard to say how much I’ve got left in me, how much longer my sacrifice can buy me. But when I go, you better believe I’m going big, and it is going to hurt.

You know, I got my start in the Blitz. I remember it like it was yesterday. It was [Glenn] Dunlop’s house that did it, you know. We were always playing together outside; sometimes his mum would give us tea. Well, it was gone. Nothing but rubble and – (heh) and Desolation. Glenn and his parents had been in the shelter out back, but I guess it wasn’t quite sheltered enough, and only his dad made it out. He was a tall, strong man, used to work as a stevedore, and I’d never seen him without a stern expression and a pipe. But now, staggering through the ruins of his life, the look I saw on his face – It woke something in me. Something truly awful.

Anyone who talks about “the Blitz spirit” wasn’t there, or wants to paper over their fear with nostalgia. Terrible things happened in the Blackout, and we hurt each other just as much as the Germans hurt us. And I hurt so very many people.

A building fire is a dreadful thing, but so much more dreadful when it’s shining out into that night.

It was the first of my crimes, but not the last, and arson has always been my thing. It’s such a simple way to destroy everything someone has built, both literally and figuratively. I found my god through my own path, served it in my own way, and when Arthur and Diego found me, told me there were others that shared my devotion- well, I can’t say it doesn’t feel nice to belong. Even if we do have our… little disagreements.

And one of those disagreements came down to… I suppose you could call it destiny. We all felt the calling, the dreams, pulling us ever closer to a world of fire and loss, a place of burning and agony when we remade the world in the image of the Lightless Flame, for one Diego called Asag.

We all felt it, longed for it. But a longing is not the same thing as an instruction. We’d all been touched and warped by proximity to the holy burning fire, but none of us had any special knowledge, no matter what Diego claims he might have read. He wanted a grand inferno, a ritual of apocalyptic burning that would make the firebombing of Dresden look like a sparkler.

Which sounded… amazing. But a few of us pointed out that the Allied air force had a tad more firepower than we did, as none of us were likely to make the rank of Air Marshal anytime soon.

And that’s when Arthur proposed his own plan: A chosen one. We would create a messiah, the flame incarnate, one who could usher in this new world, and lead us in what Diego called “The Scoured Earth.”

When we finally decided, it was Eileen Montague who came forward as a volunteer. She was five months pregnant at the time, and had already taken care of the father in the usual manner of our little congregation. Some objected, said that unless the child was conceived of the flame, it could never be a true incarnation. But they had no idea of how such a conception could possibly even work, so it was decided that it would have to be enough to birth the child by fire.

We burned down five acres of woodland to create the site. At the center of the blackened, ash-covered forest we built a pyre so high and strong the flame would be clear for miles, and so cunningly built it would catch in moments. Before it, the great bowl of pure water for Asag’s scalding baptism. And in the center of pyre, a hollow, where Eileen was to lay.

We prayed, and sacrificed, and anointed her body with holy oil and a crown of kindling. I protested the last one, felt we could do better than to ape the Christians, but I was shouted down.

At last, the hour was at hand, and as the first contractions started, Arthur struck a match. The fire was so immediate, so intense, that I was almost brought to my knees, the light of the pyre so bright for a second before it turned inwards, robbed of its glow and comfort, and turned entirely into blistering and unbearable heat.

It covered Eileen in a second, flesh blackening and cracking, lips parting in a scream that was all at once agony and joy and terror and communion, as layer after layer of skin and muscle and bone were one by one destroyed by the force of the flames, until at last nothing remained of her but ash and bone.

And on top of that, sleeping peacefully among the fire, a baby. Untouched, unharmed, and to our eyes, alight with a burning divinity.

We baptized her with the boiling water of Asag and named her Agnes, as had been her mother’s final request. But, raising a messiah, as it turns out, is a lot more challenging than creating one. The sacrifices we fed Agnes worked fine, and maintaining her as a vessel of the Lightless Flame proved no real problem at all. But dealing with her as a child was far tougher.

She was quiet, considerate, but prone to fits of violent rage, which, while not unexpected given what burned inside her, still made living in a single location for any length of time untenable. She could not be allowed near other children for fear of discovery, could not be left alone for any significant length of time, and any who were not directly blessed were often unable to survive even an hour in her company. We even lost a few members whose blessings proved… insufficient.

Arthur tried to frame all this as a test of faith, and declared that those who we lost raising Agnes had been found wanting in their devotion to the Lightless Flame.

Prick.

She was just a brat.

Eventually she began to settle down, to reach equilibrium and take her lessons more to heart. She became studious, quiet, seemed to accept and acknowledge her destiny, her duties as our chosen one, and at times she even spoke dreamily of the Scoured Earth and the pain of the world to come. Her strength was growing by the day, and even some of our most devout could not touch her for more than a few seconds.

There was some division among us as to the best course of action, something that will surely not surprise you at this stage. Some thought she needed to walk among normal children, interact with those who saw her as one of them. Some thought she needed to continue training her focus. And some thought we had waited long enough to strike at our enemies, and she was powerful enough already.

The compromise we came to was Hill Top Road. We knew it was a stronghold of the Web, full of other children Agnes’ age. We would supervise from a distance, but were confident she would be in no danger. The Mother of Puppets has always suffered at our hand; all the manipulation and subtle venom in the world means nothing against a pure and unrestrained force of destruction and ruin.

We were right on that front, though if we had known exactly how powerful the Web was in that place, perhaps we would have reconsidered.

I was… not one of those assigned to watch our chosen one, so I can’t say much about exactly what happened within the walls of that house, but it seems the fight scarred the place in a way far deeper than simple fire. A scar in reality, that I believe has since been compounded by the interferences of other powers.

Regardless, the effect it had on Agnes was unanticipated. As far as we could tell, she had destroyed the place utterly. And yet she remained bound to it, tied to it in some vital way. I knew when Arthur told me she had kept Raymond Fielding’s hand, that he was worried. But none of us could know what you were going to do.

Truth be told, I don’t know what you actually did do; neither Arthur nor Diego would explain it to me in detail, and Jude simply flies into a rage when it’s brought up. I assume it’s why we were waiting, biding our time for decades, unable to bring our designs to any culmination. Jude had only just joined at the time, and was – besotted with Agnes, though I couldn’t tell you if she loved her as a god, or as a woman. Or as both.

Whatever the situation, whatever you did, we were left paralyzed. Unable to go any further with our destiny, and, I was assured, unable to remove the impediment.

So we waited. Agnes had reached adulthood but would age no further, so there was no worry to that. Her fire would someday die, of course, but until then it would neither fade nor dim.

We did what we could. We found her a place to live, gave her Jude for a guardian, and provided for her material needs. And the years began to… slowly burn away.

My job was to provide for her less mundane requirements. I was to secure her sacrifices. I would spare you the details, but I do not wish to. I worked in a factory, you see, large furnaces that glow red-hot at all hours of the day and night. Eventually, enough of my superiors had suffered accidents or injuries that I had obtained a management position.

It was difficult to take the space I needed, and make the necessary adjustments, especially without anyone noticing, but eventually I was able to create a small workshop, just beneath the main furnace. It was far too hot for anyone to check, so I had my peace.

I took foreign workers, mostly, those with the fewest connections to complicate matters, and the most hopeful dreams of what their life might be. They were the ones that provided Agnes the most satisfying nourishment.

I would wait for them to be alone, and then I would catch them unawares. Melting their mouth shut was a simple matter, and the screams they were able to make with their throat alone were easily drowned out by the constantly roaring machinery.

I would drag them down to my workshop and slowly, bit by bit, I would melt them, draining the now liquid fat from their bodies, that I could later render into tallow. Their heart, their eyes, and their tongue I would scorch down to ash and mix into it for texture, while the rest I simply incinerated.

Once fully rendered, I would turn these poor souls into foul-smelling candles, the wicks twisted from whatever hair and tendons survived, didn’t ignite with any flame, instead burning with a black ember. And if you listened very closely, you could almost hear screaming.

Agnes would take them to her small, empty flat, lay them on the floor, and light them. Over the many hours these candles burned, she would crane over them, so Arthur tells me, inhaling all the agony, suffering, and loss from which they were created. Or he could have been lying to me, just keeping me busy with torture and murder so I didn’t get in the way of anything.

I don’t think I would have minded that, actually. At least I felt useful.

Aside from that, Agnes simply waited. We all did, but I think it was the hardest on her. So much fire and destruction trapped raging inside her as she simply sat, placid, waiting for… something.

Of course, none of us suspected what was actually going to sink it all. I mean, if you’d told me, I’d have laughed at you. That stupid coffeeshop twit. I honestly don’t know why Arthur allowed it, or why Jude didn’t step in; she’s usually so jealous. But Agnes – (exhale) Maybe Agnes asked them to leave him alone. Or maybe they were just surprised by her interest in this – boring, unremarkable fool. Maybe they assumed it was some long, torturous plan, and she was simply building the kindling for a bonfire of aching loss and suffering such as we had never before seen. (sigh) And I suppose, in a way, she was.

Just not the one any of us expected.

It wasn’t love; I’m sure of that. I don’t think it was even happiness. I think it was doubt. In that tiny sliver of affection lay a whole universe of doubt. The sort of doubt that the torturing flame incarnate cannot have, but that too many years spent in silent patience, followed by one clumsy flirt in a coffeeshop, could create. A tiny hairline fracture which destroys everything.

When she told us – (inhale) I have known anguish and destruction like few in this world, but the memory of that night still makes me shudder. The sadness and the grief that we felt at what we knew we had lost.

It was Agnes herself that suggested it. If we tried the ritual and failed, she said, it might be hundreds of years before we had the strength to try again. But if she ceased, not in culmination of fire, but in a cold and quiet death, perhaps her spark would return to the Lightless Flame and she could try again.

Not immediately, likely not even within my remaining lifetime, but sooner than if she burned. And so we hanged her, as she requested. All because of that most insidious of emotions: Hope.

We have allowed Jude free rein on what happens to the coffeeshop boy, though Agnes asked her not to interfere. She has not yet harmed him, but I cannot imagine what is going through her mind. The misery and pain he has brought upon himself.

For all her anger, she is not rash. And I fear her quiet consideration far more than I worry about her temper. It may be he lives the remainder of his natural life, but she will make sure he is never happy, and never without pain.

As for you, (shaky inhale) whatever you did, and whatever protection it might have afforded you is severed with Agnes’s death. Arthur has told us not to harm you yet, but this whole thing has really rather weakened his authority, and many of us are now looking towards Diego for leadership. But we shall see, I suppose.

I hope, when it is time, we may burn you forever, Gertrude.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends. (inhale) Nice to see Gertrude also used to get a lot of threats. So far, it doesn’t seem that any of them went desperately well, except for Elias, of course, but he didn’t threaten, did he, just – did it.

I’m curious to see what it was she did to derail this big ritual, because I’m sure she didn’t pay poor Jack Barnabas to fall in love with Agnes. (beat) Well, ninety percent sure.

No one’s come seeking vengeance recently, though, and looking at the details for the [Butcher’s] steel plant in Scunthorpe, it does seem like Eugene is still around, so I can only assume some sort of equilibrium was found. Given what happened when I met Jude Perry, I’m not in any rush to track him, or any of them, down myself.

Diego I assume to be Diego Molina, who Basira crossed paths with back in her Sectioned days, and Arthur – could be Arthur Nolan, though going from the head of a cult to watching over Jane Prentiss as a landlord does seem like something of a demotion. God knows. It’s not like I don’t have my own office politics to keep track of.

[He sighs.]
The others are doing… better, I think. Basira’s busy doing research for something secretive, unsurprisingly, but she seems to be adjusting, to, uh… the new Daisy.

I actually like Daisy now, which is a… really weird feeling. Melanie’s quiet, but I think therapy’s helping. Haven’t seen Helen much. The door is – sometimes there, sometimes not. I haven’t knocked. I’m never going to trust it. Trust – her.

(brief pause) Trust it. And I shouldn’t. Whatever its relationship to the person who was or is Helen, assuming that I can ever know its motivations is a mistake. And that just leaves Martin, which… (long pause, inhale)

Why were we chosen? Agnes was created, crafted with a specific purpose so finely tuned that even a grain of uncertainty threatened the entirety of her being. (bitter laugh over next words) But I’m so full of doubt, it feels like there’s no room for anything else, and – (big inhale) – I’m sure Martin is the same.

Is there destiny here? Bloodlines, and – prophecies? O-Or did we just – stumble into this. Maybe… we’re the opposite of Agnes. Maybe our doubts are exactly what we need. I-If that’s the case, I’m a – an amazing chosen one. (steadying breath) Don’t know how that would work, though.

I’m just worried about Martin. (sigh, under his breath) Christ. (normal) Every other Avatar gets to have their feelings burned right out of them, but me? I’ve just got to sit in mine.

I know he said he had everything under control. (inhale) I need to trust him. Whatever he’s doing with Peter, he’s – (inhale) He knows what he’s doing. Probably. I just – I need him to be okay; I just do.

If I – knew what his plan was, if I knew what Peter was doing, if I just – (he stops, cuts himself off) Can I?

[The low rumble of the Archivist’s static begins to sound in the background. The Archivist makes a few sounds of effort, which begin to grow both louder and more ragged.]
[Then the high-pitched static that resembles microphone static layers itself on top with its strange, musical, near-angelic quality, and it becomes clear that the Archivist is putting a lot of effort into this Beholding, and that, as in “Heavy Goods,” it is not clear how much of this he is in control of.]
[He continues to struggle through the process, and as he does, the distinct squeaky static of Peter Lukas begins to fade in as well.]
[There’s a sound that’s difficult to place, could possibly be some things knocked off of the Archivist’s desk, but which could also be the sound of a door opening. The Archivist groans.]
[Then all at once, the static all fades out; the Archivist begins to regain his breath.]

What?

Coffee. Drink it.

ARCHIVIST
I’m really, uh… Fine.

BASIRA
You look awful. You try drinking with Daisy again?

ARCHIVIST
[overlapping] She was here last night, as you know.

BASIRA
Drinking alone, then.

ARCHIVIST
It’s not a hangover. Well, not – I wasn’t drinking.

BASIRA
Drugs, then? Sick? Got some weird monster disease?

ARCHIVIST
Seriously?

BASIRA
[no-nonsense] We’ve been over this. You need to tell me stuff. Communication works both ways, you know.

[dry laugh] Nothing. There was too much.

You don’t remember any of it?

Took me a while to hunt it down again, but – you remember Maxwell Rayner?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, of course; your – warehouse showdown?

BASIRA
Yeah, well, whole thing kinda stayed with me.

ARCHIVIST
Mm, I can imagine.

BASIRA
Well, there’s more history there than we thought. Capital-H History.

ARCHIVIST
John Flamsteed? Basira, this is from way before the Institute!

BASIRA
The first Astronomer Royale. Had the post until his death in 1720.

ARCHIVIST
He died on New Year’s Eve.
[second to realize what he’s done] Sorry, I didn’t – Can’t really help it.

[He gives a small laugh.]
BASIRA
Well, either way, he really hated the man who succeeded him. His former assistant, Edmund Halley.

ARCHIVIST
As in… “Halley’s Comet,” Halley?

BASIRA
Yep. And Flamsteed had a… what’s the opposite of a pet name? Like a nickname for someone you hate.

ARCHIVIST
Uhhh… I don’t –

BASIRA
[overlapping] Well, he had one of them for Halley. Called him “Reimer.”

ARCHIVIST
Reimer? And, and you think –

BASIRA
Names shift over the years. ‘Specially if you’re not keen on keeping the same body.

ARCHIVIST
[pure, wondrous shock] Right.

BASIRA
Just – have a read. Let me know when you’re done.

ARCHIVIST
You’re not staying?

BASIRA
Watching you do your thing? No.

ARCHIVIST
I – suppose I understand.

ARCHIVIST
[still breathy] Right…

[stronger] Statement of John Flamsteed, taken from a partial unsent letter to Abraham Sharp, 1715. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.

Um – [flips page] Uh –

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
But my affliction in writing to you is of a wholly different character. And were I not well sure of your firm alliance and counsel, I should under no extremity impose it upon you. For I have killed a man, and barely do I have the covering of great passion for it, for I was well within my senses at the time.

You are familiar of course with my persecuter and tormentor Edmond Halley. The one so oft descending upon me as Nemesis with her sword to avenge upon my hubris. It was he, who with the president of the Royal Society, Isaac Newton, printed my catalogue of stars without my knowledge, robbing me of the fruits of my labor, turning my triumph to naught but ashes.

I have had – many a contest with the president, but I harbor little true bitterness toward him. He is a blockish creature of vanity, concerned with his appearance only, and likely to fly into an indecent heat and knavish talk at any dispute. He has no reverence for God, and I pity him the fire that awaits. But in life, my thoughts of him are simply those of disdain, and hold no corner for true hatred.

I put no such chain upon my spirit when I make my considerations of Halley, who I have long called Reimer to you in my letters, for as the odious Nicolaus Reimer persecuted the great Tycho, and ran his noble genius to exile, so, too, has my own Reimer pushed me toward ruin.

I have detailed much of his offenses in my letters to you, but as much again I have concealed within my soul and given no voice. Simply know the robbery of my celestial catalog was but the least of it.

I will admit, that in my heart, I nurtured such dreams of revenge that when they came to me the name of God felt hollow upon my lips. Another dignity stripped from me by mine enemy.

Such were the depths of the hatred that I found within myself that whereupon I would spy Reimer at the Royal Society, if I were unobserved in turn, I would to no deliberate end begin to follow him. Oft it was that I would follow his path until my better humours overtook me, or I was seen by my quarry, who would smile, and offer his insufferable greeting.

So it has been this past year, though I have never had fear he might know my intentions.

Yet this month past, it has been… much changed. Reimer’s wanderings, hitherto aimless or meandering through the gardens and pathways of the Royal Society, or the coffeeshops of Fleet Street, have of late drawn him almost out of London entirely, to a strange and shrouded wood not a league from what might draw the interests of the pompous fool with whose whims I was now well-acquainted.

And in that quiet seclusion, while I looked on in silence and astonishment, he would meet with figures both man and woman alike, with dull clothing and eyes that in the darkness of that wooded place seemed wholly black and empty. Their words were soft and impenetrable to me from the spot wherein I was concealed, but they had much impact upon Reimer, who would often stagger backwards as though struck.

They led him further through trees of gnarled and twisted woods, where the thick roof of leaves permitted not the light of moon or stars, and there they knelt around a pool so black, if it had been India ink it could have scarcely been darker. I held back a cry that threatened to force itself from my lips, for I am not so blind as to be ignorant to the practices of vile pagan exultation.

And I can describe what I saw around that pool as nothing less. And dismiss as you will my words as the shaken memory of a man appalled, but at that awful moment, their cries of worship seemed to form shapes that stirred in the water, such as I have never seen in my time upon this earth.

I fled, of course, and considered the courses such as I might pursue to relieve myself of this dreadful burden of knowledge. No longer was my concern purely for revenge upon Reimer, but a quite acute terror of the savage rites the practice of which were clearly among my peers.

I had not seen with clarity those compatriots alongside whom Reimer had joined in awful raptures, and could not state with confidence that any among the faculty to whom I might make report of his debauchery would not in turn make it known that I was telling such things of Halley, an astronomer of note, whose conduct to all others has been unimpeachable.

No. If there was to be a confrontation or action taken against Reimer, it would be I, and I alone that would have to take it.

I know it was the second of May when this took place, for it was no doubt the crowning glory that he had stolen from me that occupied his mind that eve, and caused his steps to quicken and grow careless.

Again he traced his path under that dark and hidden wood, and again I followed, quiet in my manner, keen in my observance. I cast around for other figures, but in that moment, Reimer was alone. He proceeded then, as before, to the pool of blackest water, and the clear skies of night were lost amongst the leaves. All was quiet as he gazed into that smoothed and liquid darkness.

This, I knew, was to be my chance.

I stepped from my place of concealment and began to decry him, casting my censure upon Reimer and naming before him the vile acts of pagan villainy which I had myself observed. His mute shock was but for a moment, before he let out a noise the likes of which I can scarce describe, and charged towards me, his fingers curled to claws that sought my face and eyes.

I wasted no time, and drew my small sword, and praised to God, who gifted me foresight to carry it. I struck Reimer a fierce blow to the leg. He fell, still clutching at me, and in a moment, cast my sword away into the trees and grabbed at my coat. With a fierce strength never before awakened within me, I gripped the head of my foul adversary, and forced it down, into the dark pool before us.

There I held it, the water so cold upon my skin the marks have yet to fade. And Reimer thrashed, and kicked, and made such sounds as I have never before heard of the dying.

And he was still.

I drew him up with the black water still thickly flowing from him. He was dead at my hand, and though I well knew it to be an act of defense and retribution, I felt within me a sudden terror of discovery.

I took my sword and returned to hiding in the dense growth of the forest, fearing that, should I return upon the path, my passing might be met and marked. Better to wait until I had the surety of unseen passage.

And as I waited there, the enormity of my actions settled upon me like lead, and Reimer’s dark-eyed compatriots arrived to attend him.

Seeing him prostrate and lifeless upon the ground was clearly a shock, and their distress was marked upon them. And yet there seemed no sadness or horror within their passion, but surprise and confusion, and the question they cast between them was that of what was to be done, for it seemed Reimer was vital to a task as yet unfinished.

His body was borne up by them and taken away, at the time, I believed, for burial. And when I was certain I was once again alone, I fled, leaving those infernal waters for good and all.

And were that the end of my poor story, you may well imagine my confession of such to you, for laying it in writing is an unburdening beyond what I could have foreseen. And yet it was not this that inspired in me the need to write you an account.

It was what occurred but two days past, for I was in my observatory making my notes of adjustments, as my position requires, when I was called upon, not unusually, by the president of the Royal Society. I was astonished at how cordial his conduct seemed, his temper even and his heat steady.

But it was not the attitude of the president that robbed my tongue of speech.

It was that in his visit, he was accompanied by Edmund Halley. My dear Reimer, whose body had gone cold and still in my own cruel hands.

He had – little to say, it seemed, as the president went over, once again, some – detail of my equipment, and Reimer, who was and is dead, simply watched me in solemn silence. Were it not for his handing books to the president, I should have thought him a shade or haunt, but his substance was far more than such could ever achieve.

At length, Mr. Newton took his leave, and Reimer went to follow. Before his departure, an exit that could not come too soon for my nerves, he turned towards me, and grasped me firmly by the shoulders. In my shock and fear, I offered no fight, and returned his gaze as he began to thank me.

His gratitude was so plain and sincere that I could scarce understand it as he spoke, but he repeated it again and again, thanking me for his life. For his freedom.

I stared into his eyes, and though they met mine, I saw spreading inside them the darkness and mist. Whether he be blind now, I know not, but those were not the eyes of Edmond Halley, though they were the eyes of my Reimer, the one I couldn’t destroy.

It is with this at the forefront of my thoughts that I write to you, Abraham. I know you have some small acquaintance with him, and I must warn you Halley is no longer Halley. He may appear as such, and – ape those previous observations of his own, and those more skilled, but it is not him.

Look into his eyes, and you will know. You will – know.

BASIRA
So?

ARCHIVIST
So Edmund Halley was Rayner. Or, at least – whatever was inside him. You said it was dead, though.

BASIRA
I thought it was. We shot him to hell before he could, uh… pour himself into that kid.

ARCHIVIST
Hm.

BASIRA
But I mean – didn’t you say he got blown up in World War I as well?

ARCHIVIST
Ah, uh, possibly the – the details are, um – [exhale] it’s not exactly clear.

BASIRA
You don’t- Know?

ARCHIVIST
No, and I’m not about to push my luck and try to force it. Besides, I, I rarely get anything when the Dark is involved? It’s a bit of a blind spot.

BASIRA
Hm. Point is, we can’t be sure.

ARCHIVIST
Agreed.

BASIRA
You don’t know what the ritual for the Dark is, right?

ARCHIVIST
Not really, no; um, based on this and everythi – uh, something to do with the Sun, I would guess? I, um – an eclipse, maybe.

BASIRA
I don’t think so. There’s not one due for a while, and I’ve been wondering for ages – why Ny-Ålesund? I mean, sure, that far North, it gets dark for a long time, but – there’s also really long days in the summer.

ARCHIVIST
Okay.

BASIRA
But I think – Have you got a pen?

ARCHIVIST
Uhh – Yeah, i-in the drawer.

[Basira opens the drawer.]
BASIRA
Ah, John. What’s this?

[She picks something up.]
ARCHIVIST
Hm? Oh. That’s… I, th, uh – that’s my rib.

BASIRA
[lost] Right.

[She puts it back.]
ARCHIVIST
Yep.

BASIRA
And… the jar of ashes.

ARCHIVIST
[stressed] Not – not, m,mine – I mean, it belongs to me, I, I, I guess, but it’s not – stationery is in the, uh, other drawer.

[Sounds as the stationery is retrieved.]
BASIRA
Right, thanks.

ARCHIVIST
Mm.

[The drawer is closed.]
BASIRA
Okay.

[Rustle of paper.]
BASIRA
Now… Look here.

ARCHIVIST
R-Right, ye-yes, I, I know where it is.

BASIRA
I don’t think Ny-Ålesund is the ritual location.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
I think it’s a, a staging ground.

ARCHIVIST
For what?

BASIRA
The darkest place on the surface of the Earth. The North Pole, during the winter solstice.

ARCHIVIST
I hope you’re not suggesting that Santa works for the People’s Church.

BASIRA
[exasperated] John. It’s eleven weeks of pitch-black night, as far from the Sun as you can get on the planet.

ARCHIVIST
Alright. So, why haven’t they done it already?

BASIRA
I think they were waiting for Rayner to get his new body. But my source is telling me now that they’re gearing up for something.

ARCHIVIST
These… sources, are they same ones that sent you to the Australian Outback while I was… burying myself alive?

[Basira sighs over his words.]
BASIRA
Their info is normally good.

ARCHIVIST
[yeah, right] Hmm.

BASIRA
There is one more thing that might convince you.

ARCHIVIST
They have an eldritch ball of some sort of manifested dark matter that’s going to be the focus of the ritual.

BASIRA
I thought you said you couldn’t Know things about them.

ARCHIVIST
I can still read. Actually, you should – probably see that stateme – you know what, no, later. [heavy inhale] So what’s the plan?

BASIRA
I’m getting us passage on a boat heading up there.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
I bring all the guns from Daisy’s old stash, you bring the spooks you used to mess up that delivery guy.

[Long pause.]
ARCHIVIST
What – That’s it? Christ, I thought my plans were half-assed.

BASIRA
It’s all about when we go.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t follow.

BASIRA
Summer solstice is the 21st of June. So, we leave in a fortnight.

[The Archivist begins to take a heavy breath as she speaks.]
BASIRA
And should arrive about a week before. No danger of sunset or darkness for a long time. Stands to reason that they’ll be at their weakest.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. Is Daisy coming?

BASIRA
[short pause] No.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. I, I just thought –

BASIRA
We’ve talked about it. If the Hunt takes her again, we don’t know if she’s coming back. And neither of us want that.

ARCHIVIST
No, o-o-o-of course. And I, I don’t imagine Melanie would be keen to come.

BASIRA
She wasn’t.

ARCHIVIST
Why am I always the last to know about these things?

BASIRA
By this point, I just assume the Eyeball tells you.

ARCHIVIST
That would imply it tells me anything useful. Now I’m stuck knowing how your year eight PE teacher died.

BASIRA
Miss Peterson?

ARCHIVIST
Pancreatic cancer. If you’re interested.

BASIRA
I – wasn’t?

ARCHIVIST
[struggles for a moment] No – no, o-of course not.

[He clears his throat.]
ARCHIVIST
Alright, so just – me and you, then. [sigh] I don’t suppose you could get some of the team that helped you take Rayner down last time.

BASIRA
Oh yeah, sure. I’ll just drop them a message.

[The Archivist sighs.]
BASIRA
You know, we’ve actually got a group chat going called “British Cops who love to do extrajudicial spook killings on foreign soil.”

[More sighing.]
BASIRA
I’ll just see if they’re free Saturday –

ARCHIVIST
[overlapping] Yes, yes, alright! Alright. [sigh] You’re sure about this?

BASIRA
No. But if I’m right, this is the best chance we’re going to get. And I can’t do it alone.

Okay, then. [inhale of bolstered confidence] Let’s do it.

Mikaele Salesa. You used to work on his ship.

I don’t know you.

[Archly] But I know you.

BASIRA
John…

ARCHIVIST
Floyd Matharu. Served on the Dorian from 2011 to 2014. With Salesa.

BASIRA
John, I’m not sure about this.

ARCHIVIST
I am.

Tell me what happened.

FLOYD
Wh-What is this?

ARCHIVIST
Whenever you’re ready.

FLOYD (STATEMENT)
A-Alright. Sure.

He… H-He w-was a good boss, you know? I worked for him for three years, and… treated us well. He never lied to us about the sort of thing he was into. He didn’t exactly volunteer specifics, but we all knew what we were doing wasn’t legal, and we trusted him because he knew what he was doing.

It was a weird ship to be on, though, and not just because everyone was always gossiping about whatever the latest haunted cargo was. A lot of it was because we had a-a captain, a man named Gaultier, but he reported to Salesa. Normally, if the captain’s working for someone they’re going to be on the ship all the time; they’ll just be organising things, so there’s no worries about who’s in charge, you just obey the captain. But Salesa always travelled with us, keeping an eye on whatever he was moving that day. It felt like… it felt like he was a part of the crew, even though he didn’t actually have a job to do. Always felt a bit uncomfortable when the captain was giving orders and he was there. I could sometimes feel Captain Gaultier looking to him for support or confirmation, and that always slightly undermined our confidence in him. It wasn’t a problem, not really, and Salesa never threw his weight around, never contradicted the captain in front of us or anything. It was a weird dynamic.

Way the others talked about it, he’d been at this for a long time, decades at least, and when I sailed with him it was clear he knew exactly what he was doing. He was the only one ever allowed in the cargo bay during a voyage.

I only saw one person try to break that rule, Jésus, a nasty piece of work we picked up in Colombia, and who clearly thought he smelled an opening. Salesa was a big guy, you know, but he never really made anything of it. He always used to say he needed a crew to follow him out of trust, not fear. But he didn’t have a problem using his size against Jésus when he found him. He threw the little rat overboard without a second’s hesitation, and there was nobody on that ship unhappy he did it. They’d all seen what could happen when someone else got in the cargo bay.

My last voyage with him was the one that killed him. Seven years ago; I still have nightmares sometimes. Tried to escape it, but some things follow you no matter where you go. A smarter person might have stayed off the water, but this job, it’s all I’ve ever really known. So here we are.

It was an odd time, I remember. I don’t know exactly what was different but the whole mood of the ship was off. Kind of sour, somehow. I think it must have been Salesa. Everything always kind of… reflected him. You know people like that? When he was happy, satisfied, everything seemed to run smooth. When he was angry, everyone would be on edge, irritable. But right then? He was tired. Everyone could tell. The man had been doing this job non-stop as long as any of us could remember, and he was clearly starting to feel it. Once found him poring over an old photo album. The ship was there in the pictures, but a different captain, different crew. I asked him who they were, and he just looked at me, eyes sunken like hadn’t slept, and for a second I felt like he was seeing someone else, not me. But then he just shrugged. “Dead now,” he said, “doesn’t really matter.”

That was about a month before Gantulga died. It should have been a nice simple job. I helped load the box under Salesa’s supervision, and it was barely a few metres across. Dantez told me it was a carpet that he’d bought from an old Burmese beggar woman who fed lost children to a crocodile head, but I never paid any attention. He liked to make up wild stories about whatever it was that Salesa had bought. It was light enough, though, so I thought he might have been right about it being a rug. I don’t know what went wrong. He was always so careful. I didn’t even usually think about the cargo during the trip itself, but this time I didn’t have much choice.

Gantulga and I were both off-duty that night. Played some cards, I lost some money, and we both headed to our bunks. Nothing unusual, nothing worth being burned into my mind. Except that three hours later, I was woken up by the sound of Gantulga screaming his lungs out. I ran over to him, trying to see what was going on. And he was being attacked, that much was clear, but there wasn’t anyone there. The thing that was grabbing him, trying to reach down his throat and pull him apart… it was a pattern. Diamonds and swirls and colours that seemed to imprint itself upon his skin even as it pushed itself messily into his nose and mouth. What it was made of, I couldn’t say; the way it moved and shifted made my head throb with pain. I screamed, staggered back and fell, hitting my head on the table. I can’t have been out for more than a few seconds, but when I opened my eyes he was there, dragging the thrashing body of Gantulga through the door and up onto the deck. I followed slowly, unsteadily, but got there just in time to see Salesa throw both him and what looked like a blank rug over the side and into the ocean. Then he collapsed against the railing, a look of intense exhaustion passing over his face, and I left him there.

He was drunk for the next two days, and we kept sailing on towards Cape Town. We no longer had anything to deliver there, but no-one was really sure what else to do. Whenever there’d been similar disasters before, Salesa was quick to make a new plan, let know Captain Gaultier know what the next steps were. It was one of the reasons the crew trusted him so much. He just always seemed to know what we needed to do next.

This time, though… felt different. He was distant, quiet. His words, when he spoke to you at all, were blurred with alcohol and regret. Nobody knew what the plan was, so we just kept going.

When we hit port, he disappeared for a while, nobody was sure where, and even when he showed back up he was spending his time on the phone. We all assumed he was trying to arrange the next job, but he had this… wild energy I’d never seen in him before, and it scared me. Whatever he was planning, it wasn’t going to be like the others. We were sure about that.

Finally, he calls us all together. The captain’s there, but he doesn’t look happy. Salesa starts talking, says he’s been doing this too long, he’s getting slow. Says he’s retiring. So far, so sad, but not unexpected at that point. Then he says he wants to send us off with a proper payday, that there’s one last job he wants us to do. Very dangerous, very illegal. There are murmurs, questions, some angry, some confused. Salesa says anyone who doesn’t want to be a part of it, they can stay in port with a decent severance and find another job. A few take him up on that, and the rest of us decide to stay, though the captain’s clearly not happy this is costing him experienced crew. Still, he doesn’t speak up. I can see in his eyes the greed’s got him, like it’s got the rest of us. It’s not like we were underpaid on the Dorian, but there were rumours about how much money Salesa was making out of all this. When someone like that says there’s going to be a big payout, you listen.

He was really cagey on the details, clearly being careful about exactly who he was telling exactly what. All I knew about what we going on were as follows: we were on our way to the Maldives, to a tiny island about a hundred kilometers south of Malé. No-one would tell me the name of the island, but in that area of the world any islands that small are usually private, though I had no idea who the owner might have been. Once there, Salesa and the four crewmembers he trusted most were going to take the small boat over to the island. We were to wait, and prepare to depart as quickly as possible as soon as they returned. He didn’t say exactly what he was expecting to happen on the island, but it wasn’t hard to guess that whatever he was retrieving, it wasn’t something he was purchasing legally. He made it clear we shouldn’t stop if we were followed or challenged by the authorities, and we should all be prepared to defend the ship should anyone attempt to board or stop us.

The three hours I stood on the deck after they left on the little boat may well have been the longest of my life. It was night, of course, and we had no lights showing, nothing that would give us away. The island was completely dark as well, and if it hadn’t been for the bright moon shining down on the dense trees and sandy beach, I might not have been able to see it at all. The sound of the boat’s engine died quickly, and I was left standing there, surrounded by silence, waiting for something to happen, full of fear over what it was I had agreed to be part of. I longed to have a drink, to close my eyes, and rest for only a second, but every nerve in my body was on alert.

When they returned, only two of the four crewmembers Salesa had taken were still with him. Questions as to what happened were met with dark looks and shaken heads. I felt the rumble of the ship beneath me almost immediately, and only got the briefest of glances at exactly what it was we were all risking our lives for.

I’ve gone over that memory so many times, trying to think what I might have missed, but even now, whenever I think of it, it just looked like an old camera with a broken lens. And then Salesa closed and locked the metal box, and carried it down into the hold as we started to sail away.

As he did so, I saw a flash out of the corner of my eye. I was on watch, so I hurried to the stern to see what was happening. There was a storm over the island. I don’t know where it came from, it can’t have been more than a minute since I’d last looked at it, an-and the skies were completely clear. But now it was covered in lightning, the rolling clouds above it dark and angry. The forked flashes came quickly, less than a second between them, and as the thunder started to hit my ears, I could see the trees of the island beginning to catch fire and burn. But there was something else. In the light of the flashing storm I could clearly see the waters around the island, and there was something there. A huge shape, a shadow surrounding it on all sides; getting darker, getting closer, coming up from deep, deep below the surface. It must have been huge, so large that the edge of it almost touched the ship, and had we been a few minutes slower I have no doubt whatever awful thing emerged that night, it would have taken us as well. Something began to break the surface as I realised the deep rumble was no longer the thunder, and I closed my eyes and fell to the deck, gripping the rail with all my might as a wave hit us from behind, propelling us away from it.

When it had finally subsided, and I could bring myself to look back, the island was gone and ocean was still.

Our journey back was a long one, but Salesa was in a far better mood than I had ever seen him. His step was light, his smile was easy, and the deep circles under his eyes seemed to be gone. He didn’t talk about what had happened on the island, nor of Christoph or Adreas, the two who had not returned. When we finally arrived at Southampton, he insisted on throwing a ridiculous party to celebrate our good fortune. The drinks flowed freely, and he walked around and shook each of us by the hand, telling us how much he would miss us in retirement and hiding his insincerity well. I do not believe there was a sober person on the Dorian when the night was over, and we slept easily. Well, the others slept easily, but they had not seen what I had seen.

I didn’t hear the explosion myself. Dantez told me about it, as it had apparently woken him and a few others of the crew. A big explosion, they said, further into the port. We staggered onto the deck and, sure enough, smoke could be seen a little way off, its source hidden behind a wall of shipping containers. There was no reason at that point to suspect it had anything to do with us, but I think somehow we all knew what it meant. That something had gone terribly wrong. Nobody could find Salesa or the captain.

We were still stood there, arguing amongst ourselves about what to do, when Captain Gaultier made his dramatic reappearance. His clothes were torn and his hair matted with blood. Before any of us could speak he commanded us to leave, to take up anchor and get out there. We did as we were ordered, and left immediately. Some tried to ask the captain about Salesa, but he just shook his head. He wasn’t making much sense. We managed to gather the two of them had left early to deliver the artefact, but something had gone wrong. There had been an argument. They had been betrayed. Salesa was dead.

The captain died soon after; the shrapnel trapped in his skull finally getting the better of him. Who they had been meeting, how exactly they had been betrayed, were secrets he took with him to the grave. The crew fragmented after that. I think a few of them managed to retain ownership of the Dorian, but they weren’t people I was close to. So I jumped ship the next chance I got. And I have tried ever since then to leave those memories behind me.

BASIRA
What the hell was that?

ARCHIVIST
He had information about Salesa. I thought it would help.

BASIRA
Is that why you were so keen on this ship?

ARCHIVIST
I wasn’t sure. Just had a hunch there was something here.

BASIRA
And what, you thought the best way to find it was by… slurping it out of his brain?

ARCHIVIST
He didn’t exactly seem inclined to volunteer the information. Besides, you said I needed to be ready for Ny-Alesund. “Full power” I believe were your words. The statement helped.

BASIRA
And now he’s going to see you in his dreams as he relives that for the rest of his life. Because… because a tape recorder told you to do it?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, Basira, he is. And I am sorry about that. But we needed it.

Anyway you’re the one who wants to be like Gertrude. You think she’d give a damn about a few bad dreams?

BASIRA
No.

ARCHIVIST
No. She got the job done, and didn’t care about the cost.

Just – Just tell me what happened. Please. Um. I – I won’t judge.

STATEMENT GIVER
Alright. Uh – So, you – (she sighs) You’ve, uh – You’ve got to understand my job, okay? Uh, I work for Thames Water? Uh – mainly pipes and stuff – like, I – I mean, I’m a qualified engineer, but you know, most places it’s just manual stuff, like digging, and replacing pipe – Sometimes I’ve got to – You know, there are actual sewers involved. (faster) It’s not really [unintelligible] myself enough, you know? Yeah, but who does. We don’t all get to build Formula 1 engines. Anyway. Look, it’s fine. I actually get paid quite a bit more than the rest of the crew, because, you know, if there’s, if there’s something that goes wrong, or needs an engineer, here I am!

Sorry. Um. The point is that I, I work underground. Did some work underground. (explosive sigh) Look, I know – I know this doesn’t have anything to do with – just – (shaky inhale) About five years ago, we were doin’ some work under Kentish Town. It was pretty nasty. Do you know what a fatberg is? No – uh – it – Don’t worry; Don’t look it up – Seriously, don’t. You know? It was just – It was a bad job. They had to spend a whole while down there l -, and now I don’t know if – there was something with us, and, and the work we were doing – Or maybe just the brickwork wasn’t right anymore; maybe it was rotten, or, or unstable, or – or the place – well, the place kinda collapsed on me.

You know? It’s just – one moment I’m stood there, torch in hand, and the next I’ve got a shooting pain all up my arm, and I can feel god knows how much rubble on top of me, and it’s absolutely pitch dark, I mean –

Yeah. (short, manic laugh) I don’t need to tell you it, look – I’ve – I’ve never been so scared; it was like – the world went away. Must have been a full five seconds I thought I was dead.

Excuse me.

MARTIN
It’s alright. Just – take your time.

STATEMENT GIVER
Yeah. (shaky breath) Yeah.

Well… I don’t know how long I was down there. Well – Well, I do. It was… three hours. They told me. After. But it felt like… God, it felt like it could have been weeks. I never had a, a great sense of time, and just… gone. Everything. Every bit of light or sound or anything, that changed, that said time was passing. There was nothing.

Before that, I,I never really thought about time, you know? But now… yeah. But I was lying there, panicking, screaming, just trying to make any noise, any movement, that didn’t hurt like hell. And I – Okay. I felt something. No, I felt someone grab my ankle.

At first it was great; I had this, this huge wave of relief, right? Someone had found me; they were getting me out.

It wasn’t. It was cold, right? Like – like old stone? Or, or wet sand. It felt like – rough and, and, like the fingers weren’t – I don’t know, they felt like they weren’t in the right places? And then I started thinking, and – I realized something – the way, it was, it was grabbing me, holding my leg, there was – (big inhale, shudder) It had to have been coming upwards. From below me. And there was no one else down there when that tunnel collapsed. Absolutely no one. I’m sure.

So then… I start screaming again. And kicking, thrashing about. It hurts, but – I mean, I’m scared out of my mind, but th-the hand, it just grips, tighter, and I can feel its f,fingernails, just – I,It – It started pulling. Just pulling down, dragging me down into the earth, and – yeah, it – The – I, I don’t know, just – this close to breaking, just absolutely shattering, and – and then a slab of stone came away in front of me, and there was daylight, and Abby – one, one of the work crew, was staring at me, and, and yeah.

Just like that, it was – gone.

But the bruise stuck around. Horrid, muddy bruises where the fingers had grabbed me.

So. It-It took a long time to get over that. I mean – That’s not weird, right? I mean, it was a bad time, you know – it stays with you. I signed off, what, probably about six months, with the injuries? I had really bad, uh, nightmares. Claustrophobia, I mean, obviously, right? But, uh, but I did my physio, you know, talked wi – with the counselor they gave me. Look, I did everything I was supposed to, and, and yeah, I – I guess I was fine. You know, once the bruises were gone – well, I mean, it’s easy to blame memory, right? (she laughs, nervously) You know, hallucination, all the – classic shite you tell yourself. Look, life went back to normal, I – I was fine. Until – about two weeks ago.

MARTIN
And that was when you met J – Wh – uh, one of our employees.

STATEMENT GIVER
That’s when he showed up. Uh – You know the coffeeshop, uh, just next to [Pinnacle]? Uh, th-the nice one. Well, I actually had – had a date there, you know, cute guy I met online, too sporty, which, [joke] I like, look, it – it doesn’t matter; Anyway – I get a latte, and, and sit down, waiting for, uh – Grant? I want to say Grant. Or- Ga-Gareth? Gary? Anyways, look, he’s running late, and, and I’m just reading, and there is this… creep in the corner- your guy. He just… keeps staring at me, like- oh, properly staring, like it is super intense. And, and real… weird?

Like he knows me, but I sure as hell do not know him. I – I try to ignore him, look, I just – I just read my book. And everytime I look up – there he is. Watchin’ me. You know, I’m about to say something, you know, like wh – (she splutters) When in comes Gary – Gareth – Gavin – and suddenly, hey! It’s a date. And I really didn’t want his first impression of me to be, you know, me yelling at some creeper in the corner, so I just… swapped chairs, so that I’ve got my back to your… colleague, and get on with it.

It didn’t really matter, you know, in the end; Gareth was, uh, was a bust, you know; not like – you know. I mean. He – he was fine, I guess, but it’s just nothing really there between us, you know – just a nice boring coffee with a kind old man. Took about an hour, and he clearly wasn’t feeling it either, so we, you know, we just called it. I mean, I think we actually shook hands, when he left, which, I mean, tells you something, right?

So, look, I’m packing up, all done, and, and I just – I just sort of turn, you know? Just to check if he’s still there – and he is standing right behind me. Like, like a few inches from my face? Look, it’s messed up! And I start to ask him, you know, what the hell, man, you know, like -? But he just starts talking. Slowly. But real intense. He says he works here, at the – the Magnus Institution, and I say what even is that, and he says he wants my story.

He says he needs to hear what happened to me, and I – I want to tell him to, to go away; I, I wanted to, to kick him and run. But – I – (sigh) I sit down. And I start to tell him – everything. About the job, about the collapse, a-about the hand – And more than I told you, even, and as I do, it – it’s like I’m there again. Like I can feel it grab my ankle, I, a,a cold, dead hand, and I just can’t stop talking, like I cannot shut up.

MARTIN
A-a. Are you alright?

STATEMENT GIVER
No! No, I’m not! Of course I’m not – It felt like – Like I was throwing up all those feelings again, and I wanted to, to scream, but instead I just sat and calmly told him my life story, and he just watched me. His eyes, like – His eyes were li-like drinking in every fragment of my misery. I can’t – It – (pause) And then it was over. And he looked – He looked at me like he’d just eaten, like, a perfectly cooked steak. You know what he said, he said “Thank you.” Thank you, just like that, like – like reliving the worst parts of my whole life were just a bit of a favor that I’d done him.

And then he left, and, and I-I just sat there, and cried for a while. (sniff) That wasn’t the end.

MARTIN
He – You’ve seen him since?

STATEMENT GIVER
(shaky) No. Not – But kinda. I feel like I do. I’ve been – dreaming of that tunnel again. Nightmares. Oh, god – awful nightmares. Nightmares, where the, where the hand keeps pulling, and I go deeper and deeper and, and deeper into – (shaky inhale) It takes me places I do not want to go. And he’s there the whole time, just… watching me. Watching me scream and thrash and – (inhales again) He’s all eyes. He’s all eyes. (inhale, less shaky) Look. I know that’s not – (half-hearted laugh) That is my brain. I’m not blaming him for, for being in my dreams. You know, I guess I can’t.

[She sniffs again.]
That’s absurd, right? It’s no – But I feel like I’m seeing him when I’m awake, as well? I’ve been- I’ve been having a lot of problems, since he talked to me – well, since I talked to him. (she swallows) Since I told my story. Th-The claustrophobia? It’s back, you know, worse than it ever was, and I can’t do my job. I have these, these screaming panic attacks every time I try, and – and what am I supposed to do? It feels like every time I’m even slightly underground, I –

Can’t even go into a shop basement anymore without feeling that – hand. Every time I do, every time I get that – panic just rising up my throat, I see him.

[Something drips in the background.]
STATEMENT GIVER (CONT’D)
He’s there. Not when I look properly. But just at the edge. The corner of my eye. And he’s got – well, maybe, maybe it’s just me; maybe I just – I met him once, in a coffeeshop, and he was a creep, and it messed me up. But that’s enough. Right? That is enough. So, (exhale) So I want to put in a complaint, like, like a proper complaint. Look, I don’t want to go to the police. I mean, I doubt they would – They wouldn’t even, you know, let me get this far, now would they, but – (sniff) Sorry. So, thanks, I guess.

MARTIN
Okay, um. Alright, well – (he clicks a pen, sighs)

Firstly, I’m re– I’m really sorry that this happened. Um, in – in terms of next steps –

STATEMENT GIVER
(overlapping) Just – I just – I don’t know- Y-You know, talk to him, I guess? Just tell him, like, like I mean that – it’s not okay. You know, right – I’m not – I don’t know what he did, but you know, he can’t just go around and well, you know, just keep doing –

MARTIN
(cutting her off, gently) Right. I – I understand.

STATEMENT GIVER
Good! (short pause) Well – Y– I just, I don’t want to see him again. Ever.

[Some rustling and footsteps.]
MARTIN
Wait, h-hold on, no, I just need to –

STATEMENT GIVER
(overlapping) No! That’s it – That’s – my – complaint! You know? I, I – I can’t. This place – I – I can’t be here. I have to –

[They open the door.]
STATEMENT GIVER
Bye!

MARTIN
Uh – No – Uh, but you didn’t give me your –

[The door slams. They’re gone.]
[Silence.]
MARTIN
…name.

[He sighs heavily, messes with the form.]
MARTIN
What the hell do I do with that? I mean, christ, John, that’s – that’s not okay! Oh, that ca – that can’t – (he cuts himself off) I mean, it’s not him, is it. Not – not really. It’s – what, addiction, instinct, maybe m-mind control, something like that? I – can’t believe he’d choose to do something like that. No, no, I – I can’t think like that, though, I, I can’t let myself, because if, if he’s already gone, then all of this is just – (cuts off again, heavy, weary sigh)

Th-The worst part of it is I don’t even want to talk to him about it. I just – I suppose I’m just getting comfortable with the distance. Cut off. (short, humorless laugh) Lonely. (inhale) Mind you, Peter’s not wrong. It really is easier than actually just trying to communicate with people. I should probably try and get him this tape, let him know what happened, that someone came in to – (sigh)

But then, would that just come across as an accusation? Because I don’t want to – and then, then I guess he’d hear this bit as well, so – I – it – I –

What do I do?

[The clock ticks on. For a few moments there is silence, and then there is a soft knock at the door.]
[Martin inhales.]
MARTIN
Go away.

[The knocking continues, a little more insistent. Martin sighs.]
MARTIN
(to whoever’s outside) Come in!

[The door opens and Daisy enters.]
DAISY
(soft) Hey.

MARTIN
(confused) Hi?

DAISY
Do you mind?

MARTIN
Can – Can I help you…?

DAISY
I – I saw someone come out, so I – I thought that, you know.

MARTIN
Do – Do you want something?

DAISY
Ju-Just ignore me. Continue with – whatever.

[Short pause.]
MARTIN
…Are you alright?

DAISY
Yeah. Just, uh, a bit empty around here, you know?

MARTIN
Not really.

DAISY
Melanie’s out, and – (sigh) John and Basira are still off. Bit worried. But they can take care of themselves, you know?

MARTIN
(tight) Again, not really. (short laugh) No one really talks to me anymore.

DAISY
‘Cause they reckon you’re working for the bad guy?

MARTIN
Pretty much. Don’t you?

DAISY
Oh, I mean, you’re definitely working for something evil, but – so are we.

MARTIN
(inhale) Yeah. Seems there’s plenty to go around, these days. (pause) It doesn’t bother you?

DAISY
Didn’t use to.

MARTIN
And now?

DAISY
Bothers me less than trying to go alone. At least – now it’s on my terms, better than being blackmailed into it.

MARTIN
(another humorless laugh) Yeah, I guess. (brief pause) They told you about Elias, right?

DAISY
Yeah. Basira said. Don’t like him being alive. Trying not to think about it too much. Don’t want to get too angry, start to – hear the blood.

MARTIN
…Sure.

DAISY
Can’t hear his lies from prison, though, so – that’s something.

MARTIN
I thought you believed him. You were doing all of his dirty work.

DAISY
Well, wasn’t willing to call his bluff. Not the same thing as believing. Just too big of a risk.

MARTIN
Not for Melanie.

DAISY
Well, maybe she was the only one with any sense. Even if he was telling the truth, (sigh) If we all… died… there are worse things.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
How was it?

DAISY
Don’t wanna talk about it.

MARTIN
I listened to your old statement. Wasn’t your partner down there?

DAISY
Yeah. Didn’t find him.

MARTIN
You don’t want to go get him?

DAISY
(heh) I’m not going back.

MARTIN
(vaguely smug) Hm, I’d have thought you’d have at least tried, or –

DAISY
(overlapping) I said. I don’t want to talk about it.

MARTIN
I know. Not nice being interrogated, is it?

DAISY
(inhale) I – Oh.

MARTIN
Yeah.

[Pause.]
DAISY
I’m sorry, Martin.

MARTIN
It’s alright. Wasn’t you. (he inhales) Not really.

DAISY
No, it was. I hate a lot of what I did back then; doesn’t mean I’m not responsible for it, doesn’t mean it wasn’t me.

MARTIN
(exhales) Anyway. So what’s this field trip they’re on?

DAISY
They, uh… they didn’t tell you?

MARTIN
(ha) No, I – What. Daisy, where have they gone?

DAISY
You know that town in Norway?

MARTIN
What? I – Wai – What? You don’t mean Ny-__Ålesund__?!

DAISY
Yyyyeah. They reckon there’s a ritual they need to, you know –

[Martin sighs in the background as she speaks.]
MARTIN
Yeah, but – Peter didn’t even tell me –

[He starts opening and shuffling through drawers.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
I don’t believe this!

DAISY
Sorry. Shouldn’t have said anything.

MARTIN
No, no, it’s – thank you; I just – For god’s sake, can he not stay safe for like, like ten minutes?

DAISY
I don’t think that’s an option for him anymore.

MARTIN
Yeah, I mean, sure – (slams a drawer shut) – But he just – He just doesn’t think. He always just immediately charges straight off into danger with whatever – whatever half-assed plan occurs to him at the time; I don’t get it!

DAISY
What’s to get?

MARTIN
What?

DAISY
I-I mean, it’s pretty standard stuff.

MARTIN
What?

DAISY
(coughs lightly) You used to see it all the time, back in the force, especially with the Sectioned. Not like there’s normal trauma, you know? But it’s pretty common. The most important thing becomes control, engaging on your own terms. Even when it’s stupid or dangerous. Anything to not feel helpless.

MARTIN
Oh, god.

DAISY
And of course, for John, there’s survivor’s guilt in there, too. He thinks he’s not human. Makes him very… self-destructive.

MARTIN
Yeah, well. We’ve all had trauma.

DAISY
And everyone’s changed.

MARTIN
Yeah. (long inhale, exhales as he speaks) I suppose. You’re – You’re pretty observant, you know.

DAISY
Detective, remember?

MARTIN
Yeah, you did mention. Would have thought Basira would’ve had more sense, though.

DAISY
When Basira and I were partners, I’d see this happen sometimes. She can read a situation like no one I know, always seems to know the right move, but for all her research, she never wants to put a plan together. I think she just hates all the… unknowns, the… variables. (sigh) Contingencies. If she spots an advantage, she’ll grab it, and trust herself to figure out the details as she goes.

MARTIN
(heh) Hm.

DAISY
It’s worked so far.

MARTIN
I mean. (soft exhale) I guess. Still sounds really dangerous.

DAISY
Ye-ah… Wanted to go with them, protect them, but… (soft shaky breath) Life’s always more complicated than that, isn’t it?

MARTIN
Not really.

DAISY
(inhale) You recording, or?…

MARTIN
Hm? Uh – Oh – No, no there was – hang on –

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. PEOPLE’S CHURCH RESEARCH FACILITY, NY-ÅLESUND, NORWAY]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[In the background, there is a steady racket of – what exactly, it is unclear, but something. It sounds rather like a dryer with a pair of shoes inside.]
BASIRA
Sure it’s this one?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[A clicking noise – flashlight?]
ARCHIVIST
Tape recorder thinks so, too.

BASIRA
Right. Something’s coming, then?

ARCHIVIST
Could be.

BASIRA
No windows. Guess that makes sense. We still alone?

ARCHIVIST
I never said we were. Just said I couldn’t see anybody.

BASIRA
(noise of understanding) Oh, I thought you meant, like, See see.

ARCHIVIST
Oh – No.

BASIRA
We need to figure out proper terms for this. (background noises intensify) What are you doing?

ARCHIVIST
Closing the door.

BASIRA
Leave it open. We need as much light as possible, and I’m not seeing any bulbs.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[The click of the flashlight again. The background noise is gone by this point, and we hear their footsteps as they begin to walk.]
BASIRA
Eyes peeled.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Was that a joke?

BASIRA
Yeah.

[Silence.]
BASIRA
Any clue where everyone is?

ARCHIVIST
Your guess is as good as mine.

BASIRA
Well, my guess is an ambush.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. Everyone back at the research base seemed pretty sure this place was empty.

BASIRA
And you believe them?

ARCHIVIST
They weren’t lying.

BASIRA
Wait – You – Did your –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Oh, yeah, no, I don’t think they noticed.

BASIRA
So they were serious. It’s been empty for, what, a year?

ARCHIVIST
Bit more. As far as they knew, anyway.

BASIRA
So, what, this was another waste of time? Like that Church near [unintelligible – Dasan?] (under her breath) I’m gonna kill that son of a bitch –

ARCHIVIST
No, I – (inhale) I think it’s here. I – I, I can feel it, like a – hole in my mind.

BASIRA
They just left it here.

ARCHIVIST
I – maybe. (shaky half-laugh) Kinda wish Daisy was here.

[Silence, but for the footsteps. Then they, too, stop.]
ARCHIVIST
Basira?

BASIRA
Yeah?

[Footsteps resume.]
ARCHIVIST
Sorry. (shaky inhale) I know this isn’t – BEHIND YOU!

BASIRA
Down!

[Basira fires her gun, and hits someone, who grunts in pain. At the same time, we hear the sound of glass shattering – likely the bulb inside Basira and the Archivist’s flashlight.]
BASIRA
Don’t move!

[The person continues to grunt in pain. Basira and the Archivist move closer.]
[The unknown figure spits at them.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh. Charming.

[The person starts breathing faster.]
BASIRA
Who are you?

[The person just grunts angrily.]
BASIRA
John?

ARCHIVIST
Who are you?

[The now-familiar bass component of the Archivist’s static kicks in. The person has a brief moment of resistance before their name slips out:]
MANUELA
(resisting) Manuela. Manuela Dominguez.

[In the background, we hear the mid-tone range of the Archivist’s static fade out.]
BASIRA
Where is everybody?

MANUELA
(scoffs) Go to hell!

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Answer her.

[Big, booming static again.]
MANUELA
They’re dead. Because of you.

ARCHIVIST
Me?

BASIRA
(to John) What did you do?

ARCHIVIST
(hey!) Nothing, I don’t think!

MANUELA
Your Institute.

ARCHIVIST
(soft) What?

MANUELA
So she sent you to finish the job?

BASIRA
Who?

MANUELA
Your Archivist –

ARCHIVIST
I –

MANUELA
– Gertrude Robinson.

ARCHIVIST
Gertrude?! I –

BASIRA
(overlapping) That doesn’t make any sense.

ARCHIVIST
I, uh… (inhale) What. Happened?

[Bass.]
MANUELA
Don’t – Don’t make me, please!

ARCHIVIST
Tell me.

[Manuela exhales. The static intensifies. We start to get the mid-tones again, and nearly get all the way to the point where the highest shimmery overtone usually kicks in.]
MANUELA
Fine!… Fine.

[The static immediately begins to fade.]
MANUELA
And what do you wish to hear? Shall I tell you of the decades of preparation? Of the long wait for the eclipse? Three hundred years from the failure that birthed the thing that preached from the depths of Maxwell Rayner. The sacrifices made to birth the Dark Star that would make it all possible?

It was to be a week of night and horror, culminating in the eclipse that passed over Ny-Ålesund on the 20th of March, 2015, almost three hundred years after Halley’s eclipse passed over London. We had hundreds of sacrifices prepared and ready, plunged into darkness and terror for days on end. All prepared to culminate in the unveiling of that point of purest night at the moment of the eclipse’s height.

It would open the door to a world of true and holy darkness, extinguish the sun, and take us to a place where we would be redeemed of our base and corrupt need for light and warmth.

Maxwell was here, with me, prepared for our moment of triumph, and our churches around the world were ready, in those lost and forgotten places of worship, shut up and left in shadow.

Hither Green was, I believe, where your Institute was watching, but Natalie’s efforts were but a small and meager part of the greater effort. When they collapsed, it was as nothing to the grand ritual. Though… perhaps we should have seen it as the first sign of what was happening. But, we had no idea.

To begin our seven day feast, we slew the still and lightless beast, and drank of its stagnant blood, submerging the first of the sacrifices in the brackish water it had blessed with its stillness.

Maxwell plunged its claws into his chest, freeing the darkness within him, and we waited. And we sang. And we exalted in divine stillness.

The darkness was beyond anything that could be imagined, and even in my wildest experiments in the void of space, I could not have believed such a peace was possible, as I felt in the quiet whimpering terror of that place.

The sky was light, but we were well-protected, and we knew that when the sun was swallowed in eclipse, the darkness would be complete. We believed it far too late for anyone to stop us, and the crude methods of your Archivist least of all. The death of a few have never been more than an inconvenience, and that’s all she was ever really capable of.

You were not the first to try and stop us, you know. Not even within living memory. I was but newly joined when Lynette fled the church, and Maxwell had her silenced. But I remember her brute of a husband. He fed the beast for us, you know, when first he believed Lynette might still be saved. Then, later, we faithful served as his fuel to banish it.

But, not for long. That’s the thing about darkness, isn’t it? You try your hardest to eradicate, flood your surroundings with light, but it’s always there at the edges, waiting for the glow to weaken, to return and cover you forever. Robert Montauk discovered that the hard way. And someday, so will your Gertrude.

But we got so close. We touched it. There is another world, a world of still and quiet darkness, where no heat touches, and death cannot find you. You might wander beneath that empty sky of void forever, and never see a light to guide your way. No left, no right. No up or down. Only forward, into the crowded, shivering gloom.

For that night is not empty, far from it. Things move there, the sound of shuffling. Scuttling. Crawling. A scream. The fall of gentle stagnant raindrops that chills you as you try desperately to know if that is the sound of the storm… or something out there.

It is a world of the fear of darkness, and as I began to see it, I felt again that celestial terror that had not gripped my heart since first I gazed upon the pitch-black sun that I had created. The scream was mine, and it was joined by uncounted voices in fearful song. I was complete. It was so very close. We were to slice a hole in the world, and this paradise would flow through the wound like ink, smothering the sun, and all its children.

Maxwell had always had the visions, the drive. Whatever was inside him pulled him to this end, to this great undertaking, like a magnet, and I was so very honored to be his right hand. Natalie and the others followed, but they did not truly understand. Not truly, with their talk of peace and unity and Mr. Pitch. A friendly name, to try and hide from a concept they couldn’t grasp. Vardaan Darvish had an inkling, I thought, but he crossed a Montauk, which has traditionally gone poorly for us.

But as the hours turned into days, and the final dusk drew closer, it seemed as though all the uncertainty was washed away.

I don’t know exactly when it all started to come undone. I think Maxwell first felt the ripples four days before the eclipse was due. It was strange. Like a pause in the hysterical whimpering and fruitless prayers of the sacrifices. And a ripple that was felt through the waters, and the stagnant blood that bound us. A disruption. We would later learn that this was the collapse of the ritual at Hither Green. But it was only the first.

Our congregation in Alaska disappeared the next day, and Russia, as well. One by one, it seemed our scattered whisperers of night were falling, and holding it together, keeping the lightless world anchored to our star, bringing it closer, was becoming an almost unbearable strain on Maxwell. I helped as I could, but without knowing what was happening, there was little I could do to stabilize it.

I began to drown the sacrifices. Too soon, perhaps. But it worked, to keep it going, and keep it together, until at last, we felt it. The eclipse.

We had been worshipping in the deepest dark, and yet, when it crossed the sun, I felt it rolling over us, like a cooling balm on a summer’s day, plunging us into a deep, black void, far more complete than I can ever convey with mere words.

It was divine. And as we unveiled our new and absent sun, the sacrifices who remained screamed and fell in holy agonies, and the world of endless night we had been promised began to pour in, shining out and all around us. It touched and caressed our souls with the soothing fears of night, and I heard Maxwell weeping with joy at what we had done.

And then, it stopped.

It just. Stopped.

All at once, that loving embrace was stripped from us, and it began to retreat, to recede back into the place it had come from. (getting emotional) We were so close! (softer) We were so close.

I heard Maxwell cry out, scrambling desperately into the dark sun, stopping just short of touching it. But it was too late. Whatever it was that you and your Archivist did, it clearly worked.

We left, half of us dead, and the other half destroyed by coming so close to the true essence, (sigh) and being denied.

In my most wretched hours, I wonder – perhaps it was us. Perhaps we simply lacked faith. We weren’t worthy. The world wasn’t worthy. But – no. We were ready. We had earned our dark rapture. And we were robbed.

I don’t know how long we waited after that. It was weeks before anyone spoke. And then… when they did… the arguments began. The recriminations, the desperate resolutions to try again, to find what went wrong. But, I could see in his eyes that Maxwell was so very tired. And all the words fell to nothing. Instead, we began the search for his successor, a new host for his… continuation.

He would regain his strength, and we would plan our next move. It was difficult, though; the approaching culmination meant Maxwell had not prepared another host, and the search for another vessel was long and involved. Finally, about eighteen months ago, we found one: a child, whose father had, by coincidence, been directly marked by the Dark.

It was a desperate plan, but we were desperate, a shadow of what we had been. Maxwell left me here to guard the Black Sun, and everyone else left to help in his rebirth.

But it didn’t work, did it? I can only assume we were too weak to hide from you, and you struck when Maxwell was vulnerable.

For the first six months, I let myself hope that my suspicions were unfounded, that the silence I felt was simply… him lying low, recovering, before returning to his abandoned disciple.

But no. Soon enough, I could no longer fool myself. He had been slain, and I was alone.

And here I have remained. Perhaps I have told myself that I am preparing, gathering my own strength, and making plans to continue the church in his name. But I think in my heart, I have been waiting for this moment. For the final axe to fall, and finish the last remnant of our holy crusade.

And here, at last, you are.

[She sighs, breathy.]
MANUELA
There. Now you can kill me like the others.

[A sigh.]
BASIRA
She telling the truth?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. I, I mean – Unless she can lie to me somehow. (inhale) You said it wasn’t the eclipse.

BASIRA
It’s not the time.

ARCHIVIST
Well. She believes it, at least. This doesn’t make any sense.

MANUELA
Well, where is she? Afraid to face what she’s done?

BASIRA
Just shut up.

MANUELA
(audible smirk) Coward. So, how did she do it? It’s been three years waiting, guarding this place without hope. At least do me the courtesy of telling me how she collapsed our moment of triumph.

[A sigh as she speaks.]
ARCHIVIST
You really don’t know, do you?

MANUELA
Know what?

ARCHIVIST
Gertrude’s dead. She died right around the time of your ritual.

MANUELA
(smirk again) Ha. So, stopping us took everything she had.

BASIRA
You wish. She was murdered. Unrelated, as far as we can tell.

MANUELA
That’s – Well – Then why are you here? Maxwell is dead. The ritual failed. What’s left?

ARCHIVIST
(inhales) A good question. (exhale) Basira?

BASIRA
You said the Dark Sun was still here.

MANUELA
(light laugh) Fine. If you’re so keen to take everything, undo the work of centuries, it’s just through that door.

BASIRA
John?

[The Archivist sighs. Static begins.]
ARCHIVIST
How dangerous is it?

MANUELA
Only myself, Maxwell, and Natalie could even look upon it. It will annihilate you both in an instant.

BASIRA
Ask her how we can destroy it.

ARCHIVIST
I know how. I just need to see it.

BASIRA
See as in…?

ARCHIVIST
As in… actually see it.

MANUELA
Go ahead. Just try.

BASIRA
(overlapping) Look, it’s okay, John. No one else knows it’s here. And if we just leave it, no one will know.

ARCHIVIST
No, I – (inhale) I’m doing it. (another steadying inhale) Get out.

[Basira leaves. The Archivist takes several steadying breaths, and then opens the door.]
[The Dark Sun sounds melodic, like pipes groaning harmonics into the wind, like the mournful notes of a creaking iron gate as it is opened for the first time in years.]
[An enormous rush of static begins building; it is not the Archivist’s static, is much too reedy and wispy for that.]
ARCHIVIST
It’s – It’s beautiful.

[The static overtakes the audio field; Manuela gasps and screams –]
MANUELA
No – NO!

[All at once the static rushes away.]
BASIRA
John!

[Basira opens the door and hurries back.]
ARCHIVIST
No, I, I’m okay.

[Something else shatters – there goes flashlight #2. The Archivist yelps. Basira shoots.]
BASIRA
Get down!

[She shoots twice more.]
ARCHIVIST
(breathing hard) Basira?

BASIRA
I’m alright, just – just one second.

ARCHIVIST
(background) Um…

BASIRA
Stay here.

ARCHIVIST
(after her) Look, I’m okay, I can help –

[But it’s too late. Basira has walked off, presumably in pursuit of Manuela. The Archivist groans in frustration. There is a relative silence, during which he catches his breath.]
[Then a soft static begins to fuzz in the background. It is one we know, one we have heard many times before. A door creaks open.]
ARCHIVIST
Did you catch her?

HELEN
Yes.

[The Archivist gasps: this is not who he had been expecting.]
HELEN
She needed a door.

ARCHIVIST
H-H-How did you –

HELEN
Oh, finding this place was easy without the darkness.

ARCHIVIST
Will… she be coming back?

HELEN
(thoughtful) No. Uh… This one, I think I’ll keep.

ARCHIVIST
Why are you here?

HELEN
I told you! I’ve decided to help. I thought you might like a way home?

ARCHIVIST
Another door?

HELEN
If you want it. (short pause) How was it?

ARCHIVIST
Hm?

HELEN
Looking upon the Dark.

ARCHIVIST
I thought I was going to die.

HELEN
You seem to think that a lot. I remember when you thought you were going to die at my threshold.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

HELEN
Go find your Basira. Then let’s get you both home.

[The Archivist exhales softly.]

MARTIN
Martin Blackwood, (sigh) Assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute, recording statement number 0090310, statement of, uh, Gary Boylan, given October 3rd, 2009. Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
It was grey. I remember that so clearly. And hot. But no sun, no sun at all. The sky had that thick layer of clouds that – that catches the heat, and it choked me on it. Fields and fields of yellow grass that went on forever, with rusted pylons looming over all of it. It was that – that appalling sort of summer you only get in the middle of England, with all the joy of the season stripped away, leaving endless fields of dry soil and emptiness.

There was nothing to be done, nowhere to go, just watch and wait, and think about the – decay of it all. Walking among the detrites of the countryside is the surest way I know to find yourself close to the transience of humanity, seeing the – little hints, the preview of what’s to come for all of us, when the world no longer cares enough to keep us alive.

Have you ever been driving along a motorway, passing through the middle of some rural nothing place, when you spot, in the distance, on some tiny road you have no idea how to reach, a row of three or four terra-suburban houses, just sitting there, no town or village for miles, just a weird unattached little street? That’s where I live. It’s where I grew up, where I left forever, and… where I returned to after my mother died, and my business collapsed.

The two events were unrelated, but – both happened close enough together that I ended up moving back in with my dad. I told myself it was to take care of him, but – (heavy exhale) I’d been there five years before I knew it, and in a lot of ways, the old man seemed more capable of dealing with the world than me.

Not that he was supportive. God, no. He’d been a vet for most of his life, and spent a lot of that time working with livestock. I think all those years hanging around farmers must have rubbed off on him. He hated doctors, for instance, something I always pointed out was absurd, given his own job. I’d say he was a vet, and he’d say yeah, he was, and start talking about how many animals he’d put down in his career.

I never had any interest in continuing the conversation after that. He’d always been blunt, but after mum died – god. It was like his whole personality became callous.

I should have left him to himself, but there was something about that dismal little house, all alone except for Mrs Whitshore on one side, and the empty house that no one could sell on the other. Something kept me rooted there, sleeping in a bedroom that hadn’t changed since I was fifteen, and caring for a man who I’d rather just shut up. (sigh) We were both trapped there, I think. Bound together in a sort of wordless misery. I would look at him, and see a grim sort of destiny for myself: trapped here, until I became him; any future I might have had, sacrificed to his. (long sigh) I always used to go for long walks through the fields to try and escape for a bit. I usually managed to walk for an hour and a half before my paranoia kicked in, and I started to worry that he’d have a – fall or something, and have to head back.

An hour and a half was plenty, though, for all the places I could go. We were a long way from any real trails, and – (inhale) – the most scenic things to see were rusted tractors, piles of discarded tires, or the huge metal skeleton of an old disconnected power pylon.

It was a bleak and empty rural wasteland, and when the summer heat hit, without shade or shelter, it was almost as relentlessly oppressive as that old man. (shaky inhale) But I still took my walks.

It was this last August that it happened. I was about an hour into my walk, having had a row with him about his failing eyesight, a subject that made him even more defensive than usual; I was passing by an old cheap metal barn when I heard it. I’d been listening to music as I walked, when my iPod abruptly cut out. I stopped where I was, and took it out of my pocket, assuming I’d knocked it, or somehow turned it off. But the screen was on, apparently playing music, though I didn’t recognize the song.

I got a pretty sizeable music collection, but I feel like I do know it pretty well. This one had no artist, no album, just the track name: “Numbers.”

As I stared at it, I began to hear something from my headphones. It was a faint and tinny tone, like it was far off, or produced by a low-tech synthesizer or something. The tone began to shift, and I realized that it was playing a tune. It seemed to be a crude rendering of the opening lines of the Skye boat song.

I only got through about a line and a half of the old folk melody before it abruptly cut off. There was a moment of silence, before it was replaced by a voice of a man – but his was so distorted and pitch-shifted that it could have been anyone. It barely even sounded human as it, as it spoke in a strange monotone.

Five. Nine. Three. Seven. Five. Six.

Now, I’m not an idiot. I’ve heard about number stations; I know all about the Lincolnshire Poacher and the Russian Man; I know they’ve all got perfectly normal explanations and real-world uses for – espionage and that. What that didn’t explain is how a number station found its way onto my iPod.

I checked, and its radio wasn’t even on. Seemed to be coming from my music player, though I had a look through my library, and couldn’t find anything that matched it.

The sky was still grey. The sweat dripped off me as I sat against a rotting fencepost, and the numbers kept coming.

Three. Zero. Five. Eight. Three. Nine. Two. Eight. Four. Six.

Eventually I staggered to my feet and began to make my way home. My footsteps were heavy, and my hands shook slightly as I tried to steady myself. Do you know that one of the symptoms of a heart attack is literally a sense of impending doom?

Well, I wasn’t having a heart attack, but – I think I know what they mean. What settled over me wasn’t dread; there wasn’t enough uncertainty for that; it was doom. I was certain that some sort of disaster was on the horizon.

I’d walked less than a hundred yards when the numbers stopped coming, and “London Calling” started playing again.

That summer seemed to drag on forever. The boredom and irritation of trying to care for my dad was only heightened by the weather,and we were both feeling it. Just didn’t have anything to do.

I don’t really want to go into my living situation here, but – it’s enough to say I wasn’t working a regular job, and while I could, theoretically, contact my old mates, they’d all gotten on with their lives without me. The world had moved on. I was left behind.

I did do a bit of research into number stations, but I didn’t find anything new. I did find a couple of clips online, though, which were enough to convince me that what I’d been hearing had been a number station, or at least a – passable imitation, although the voices on the proper recording sounded neutral, almost mechanical – very different to the grating distorted mess I had heard.

I couldn’t get it out of my mind, though. What did it mean? What did any of it mean?

Took about a week of searching to find it again. To be honest, at the time I didn’t even realize I was looking for it. I just found myself going further and further afield, retracing old routes for the sake of it. Always with my music cranked up so loud, I couldn’t hear the insects buzzing everywhere.

I couldn’t have told you why. Not really. At least not until I heard it again: that same tinny rendition of the “Skye boat song.” And then:

Four. Seven. Four. Nine.

I stood there frozen for a moment, that strange feeling of doom returning in an instant. I checked my iPod, and, sure enough, the radio was off, and it said it was playing a track called “Numbers.”

It was fainter than it had been before, though, harder to pick out the exact numbers in the distortion and the quiet, so I began to walk again, this time paying close attention to the volume and clarity of the sound.

One. Six.

Fainter to the north.

Two. Eight.

Unchanged. Going south:

Three. Zero.

Southeast was stronger:

One. Six.

But began to weaken again after a mile or so.

Five. Zero.

Much stronger around the eastern hill.

Four. Nine.

There! The pylon. That was it. Except, obviously, that wasn’t it. It wasn’t a broadcast tower; there was nothing in or around it that could have possibly been sending out any signal. It was just a – collection of old and twisted metal bars, rising up into the half-collapsed power tower. It must have been decades since it had been anything other than a decaying steel obelisk.

Even if that hadn’t been this case, this wasn’t a broadcast; this was – this was – inside my iPod. It would have to be something else, something cutting-edge and new – but for miles around me was nothing but droning insects and dismal English summer!

Nonetheless, when I stood in the center of the hollow beneath that pylon’s rusted corpse, the numbers came through, crystal clear.

Five. Six. Four. Eight. Four. Six. Four. Seven. Four. Eight. Two. Seven.

With each new number, my blood pounded, and my heart raced – th,though I didn’t have the faintest idea what they might’ve meant. I’d actually brought a notebook and pen, I now realize, just to write down the numbers, and so I did.

Four hours I spent, patiently jotting down the numbers. The Skye boat song repeated every hour and half, but I went through the sequence a few times just to assure myself it didn’t change, and I hadn’t missed any.

When I finally took out my headphones, the sudden rush of summer evening sounds hit me like a wave, leaving me reeling and dizzy. It took me a moment to realize how late it was, and how sunburned I had gotten in the process.

Everything ached, and my heart pounded as I limped home. I’d been out easily twice as long as any time before. But, my dad didn’t say a word about it, just sat in front of the TV, laughing at some crappy panel show, smoking that god-awful pipe that left the wallpaper yellow and peeling.

I remember thinking he wasn’t content to just destroy himself. He seemed to have to take out everything with him.

I didn’t return to the pylon for a long time, except to confirm that the numbers weren’t changing between days. I had them, though, and the numbers were all that mattered. I didn’t know why; I’m sure there wasn’t a reason, not really, but – I knew it was in there.

Realistically, it would be impossible to decode it without whatever key the cipher might have been using, and honestly, for the longest time, it seemed to be. I did as much reading as I could on cryptography and – codebreaking, and all of it seemed to point me toward one simple conclusion: breaking this code by myself was – simply impossible.

But I still tried. I spent weeks in my room, desperately applying every method I had available. Nothing worked. But I didn’t stop. The alternative was looking after my dad, whose recent breathing issues had left him more ratty than ever.

So, I worked myself into exhaustion instead, staring at those meaningless strings of numbers until I almost collapsed, and my eyes couldn’t focus on anything. And that was when I realized: it wasn’t the numbers. It wasn’t the code. It was what was behind the numbers, shifting and waiting and, and coming towards me like a tidal wave, and I knew what the message was, the urgent and terrible message.

About the destruction that was coming on the heels of mankind, about the cold and cruel warmongers who play games of code and conspiracy, hidden behind the endless streams of numbers.

And within those numbers are all of our dooms. If you know how to read them. And I read them. I read them all, and saw the doom of everyone who lives and breathes and hopes for life and happiness.

I fled the house. I ran to the pylon, that ruined place that knew all of the numbers, and I fell to my knees and wept. I begged it to spare us, to spare me, as I stared at the flesh I knew would redden and bubble and blister away to the bone beneath.

I didn’t need headphones to hear the numbers now. They were pouring from the air around me and threaded through my mind, and no matter how I begged, they would not stop.

When I returned, the house was in ruins, the windows shattered and broken, glass strewn across the floor. There was nothing left of my dad, save a charred shadow along the wall, scorched through the plaster, and into the now-exposed brick. All that was left of Mrs Whitshore was powdered bone.

There are terrible things coming, things that, if we knew of them, would leave us weak and trembling, with shuddering terror at the knowledge that they are coming for all of us. We all made them, and their course is already plotted.

You can see them in the numbers. If you only learn how to read them.

MARTIN
Statement ends.

[He clears his throat, takes a deep breath, lets it out quickly.]
MARTIN
Right. Another – statement. Another side to Peter’s Extinction. I think. I – Yeah, I, I couldn’t follow some of his reasoning, but I think it was about nuclear weapons? In keeping with the theme, I suppose.

(speaks as if intending his next words to be overheard) I just wish Peter would stop trying to convince me his new power is real, and more time telling me what he plans to do about it.

(sigh) And where I fit in. I mean, fine, I guess I’ve li–

[Knock-knock-knock on the door. Martin takes in a small, soft, startled gasp, waits in silence.]
[The knock-knock-knock comes again. Martin flips over the statement, then:]
MARTIN
Come in.

[The door opens.]
DAISY
Mind if I join you?

[Martin starts writing something; the door closes in the background.]
DAISY
They’re back. I thought you might wanna know.

[Martin keeps writing.]
DAISY
(inhale) Seems like it went smooth – too smooth for Basira, sounds like. (small laugh) Keeps looking at John like she can’t believe he made it back.

[Martin keeps writing.]
DAISY
I, uh, I mentioned our conversation to him; he asked me to check on –

MARTIN
Just leave.

DAISY
Sorry?

[Martin inhales as if he’s preparing himself for something.]
MARTIN
Get out.

DAISY
(????) Oh. Right. Sorry; I didn’t –

MARTIN
It’s not difficult; just get out!

[He keeps writing.]
DAISY
Fine! Fine. Just thought –

[She opens the door; Martin goes off.]
MARTIN
No! No you didn’t! We’re not – We’re not friends, Daisy! None of us are; we’re all just trapped together, here, and, and kidding ourselves that we don’t hate it. Christ, there are more important things than, than feelings right now, alright, so just – leave me alone! For good.

[During this, Daisy exhales. Loudly.]
DAISY
Right. You got it.

[She leaves, door closing behind her. The second she’s gone, Peter Lukas’s trademark squeaky static comes in. There’s an added stronger bass to it. Martin sighs.]
MARTIN
Well?

PETER
I’m impressed. And grateful.

MARTIN
(significantly less distressed than he’d sounded just a few moments earlier) I didn’t do it for you.

PETER
Even better.

MARTIN
It’s easier, this way. I’m sure you would have had no problems sending her away.

PETER
I hadn’t really thought about it. And now, thanks to you, I don’t need to.

MARTIN
(nearly cutting him off) Yeah, well. It seems to be your go-to move for dealing with anyone.

PETER
I’m just not big on confrontation. You understand, I’m sure.

MARTIN
We. Are not. The same.

PETER
Of course.

MARTIN
So what now?

PETER
Did you read it?

[Short pause.]
MARTIN
Yeah.

PETER
And?

[Martin takes a really deep inhale and subsequent exhale: Give me strength.]
MARTIN
I believe you.

PETER
You don’t still think I’m trying to trick you into a grand ritual?

MARTIN
I mean I’m not about to start chanting stuff for you, but – the details you’ve given me all seem to check out. (small sigh) So far.

PETER
Good!

MARTIN
So what’s our next step?

PETER
For you, keep researching. I’m sure we haven’t found all the statements in here that deal with the Extinction yet. One of the downsides of not serving the Ceaseless Watcher is that we have to actually look things up. Not to mention that Gertrude was distressingly good at obfuscation. The more you know about our enemy, the better.

MARTIN
And you?

PETER
I have my own explorations I need to attend to. And a, um, meeting. To arrange. For you.

MARTIN
For me?

PETER
I’m absolutely delighted with your progress, and I believe you deserve some straight answers.

MARTIN
…But not from you.

PETER
Oh, no. That sort of conversation makes me very uncomfortable; no, I’m owed a favor by a friend of mine. I’ve asked him to stop by, once he’s back in the country.

MARTIN
You’re not just going to tell me, maybe?

PETER
(can hear the smile) When have I ever?

[Martin sighs the longest sigh he ever did sigh.]
PETER
Oh, come now. What would life be without the occasional twist? Oh, speaking of, I’ve had report of a workplace dispute in the library, and I would value your input.

I’m trying to get out of the habit of, what did you call it – sending them away?

[Martin sighs again, weary and longsuffering.]
MARTIN
Fine.

GERTRUDE
You… don’t mind, do you?

[The man who speaks next’s voice is low, gravelly. Every word is laced with disdain for Gertrude Robinson, and he seems like he’s only just keeping himself from spitting on her. This is Arthur Nolan.]
[He sighs.]
ARTHUR
‘Course I do.

[Gertrude scoffs.]
GERTRUDE
That’s a shame.

ARTHUR
If I really wanted to kill you, nothing could stop me.

GERTRUDE
If that were a possibility, Arthur, I should hardly have agreed to meet you.

[It’s Arthur’s turn to scoff.]
ARTHUR
Yeah you would. You’d’ve set something up. Try to get me first.

GERTRUDE
If I wanted you dead, Arthur, there are much simpler ways to do it.

ARTHUR
Yeah. Think you know how?

GERTRUDE
I do, yes. And I’m very willing to, if necessary.

ARTHUR
(dry) Oh, I’m sure. I’m shaking in my boots.

[Gertrude sighs: Time to spell it out, then.]
GERTRUDE
Look, Arthur, I need you to understand that this isn’t simple posturing. I don’t see a way we can meaningfully progress this conversation while you’re under the impression that your threats mean anything to me.

ARTHUR
Big talk. But Agnes is dead. And I don’t know if you heard, but your little woodland circle’s been broken. So, I don’t really see anything getting in my way, if I wanted to burn the flesh off your snarky bones.

GERTRUDE
Ah. (small laugh) I assume you haven’t checked on, uh, Eugene, then?

[Pause.]
ARTHUR
What?

GERTRUDE
Eugene. Well, whatever his name was, Vanderbilt, or some such. You sent him to intimidate me a couple of years ago. You must remember; of course you know him. Used to live in Beckingham, but moved out to that flat in, uh, Ilford last year.

ARTHUR
Yeah.

GERTRUDE
Well, he hasn’t been at your little meetings the last two weeks, has he? I suppose no one’s looked into it yet; not surprising, he seemed a thoroughly unpleasant little man.

ARTHUR
Are you – Wh– Di–

GERTRUDE
Tell you what; why don’t you make a few calls,

[Something, likely a phone, is placed on the desk.]
GERTRUDE
– check it out, and then we can continue our little discussion. Alright?

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
GERTRUDE
Well?

[A low sigh, that same sound of the phone being placed on the desk.]
ARTHUR
How’d you do it?

[Gertrude laughs.]
GERTRUDE
You don’t need to know that. What you do need to know is I can do it again, if I need to. To you, or any of your lackeys, if I need to.

ARTHUR
(hm) Not mine anymore.

GERTRUDE
No, no; I forgot – Your authority isn’t what it used to be, these days.

ARTHUR
Yeah.

GERTRUDE
Well, if a warning from you isn’t going to convince them, let me know. I’d be happy to provide a further example.

ARTHUR
(through gritted teeth) You’ve made your point.

GERTRUDE
Good.

ARTHUR
Eugene. It – hurt him.

GERTRUDE
(laugh) Oh, yes. I’m sure your master was delighted with how – awful his death was.

ARTHUR
Don’t push it.

GERTRUDE
You know, thinking about it, the amount of pain and loss and legitimate devastation I’ve caused among your little cult over the last, what, forty years? I think the Desolation is probably very fond of me.

ARTHUR
That’s blasphemy, it is.

GERTRUDE
Is it? Or maybe you just picked a bad god.

ARTHUR
Shut it. I don’t have to listen to this.

GERTRUDE
Mm, uh, then… feel free to try and leave.

[For a moment, we hear nothing but Arthur’s incensed breaths.]
[Gertrude audibly smirks.]
GERTRUDE
Hm. Now, here’s the problem for you, Arthur. The way I see it, you came here believing that whatever defenses or assurances I might have had died with Agnes. Or broken, along with the circle. And whether or not you actually killed me, you were really hoping to use me to restore your standing with the Lightless Flame.

Murder, kidnap, torture, oh, something to impress the church group. Unluckily for you, I’ve had almost four decades to prepare for this, and now… well… you just don’t know if killing Eugene was the end of it. (unmitigated glee) What, maybe I have something special prepared for you as well.

ARTHUR
(get a load of yourself) You’re so goddamn smart.

GERTRUDE
(suddenly cutting) And you’re all lazy fools. So used to it being easy, to picking off the vulnerable and the unprepared, you can barely conceive of anyone actively working against you, of being ready.

You honestly thought when she died I’d just be struck dumb with terror, just waiting around for one of you to finally get around to revenge, paralyzed with fear, because that’s all you’ve ever know.

ARTHUR
You’ve made your point.

GERTRUDE
(hm) I’m pleased to hear it.

[The briefest pause, and then:]
ARTHUR
Do you?

GERTRUDE
Do I… what?

ARTHUR
Have something for me. So I end up like Eugene.

GERTRUDE
Why don’t you try to leave and find out?

[Pause as Arthur presumably tries to do this very thing.]
GERTRUDE
Good. Now, we can have a proper conversation.

ARTHUR
You mean – you ask me questions, and I – I spill my guts?

GERTRUDE
No need to be petulant, Arthur. If it would make you feel better, you could ask me a question first.

ARTHUR
Alright. Agnes. How’d you do it? Never did understand it, not really.

GERTRUDE
Ah. That’s a fair enough question. It was the Web. I didn’t know it at the time, of course, and I would call it an accident, but it never is, with them. It’s only after the fact that you can see all the subtle manipulations.

I was very new to it all, of course. I mean, I was, what, can’t have been older than twenty-five. Would you believe that you were the first proper ritual attempt I’d encountered. (she laughs) I really thought you were unique, special, (puffed exhale, exaggerated) an infernal cult raising their demon messiah to bring about hell on earth. (heh) You can imagine all the heroic fantasies that that played into.

So, I began researching what I thought was a counter-ritual of sorts. Like I said, I was young, naive. I somehow found just the right books, made just the right connections, and even got what I thought was a piece of blind good luck when I found a tin box in the ashes of Hill Top Road, containing some perfectly preserved cuttings of her hair.

Of course, what I thought was a banishment ritual turned out not to be. The circle I constructed was more of a – (exhale) – an invitation.

It let the Mother of Puppets bind me to Agnes, interweave our existences at some… metaphysical level, as it had with Fielding and the house.

It was the most painful experience of my life. I mean, I’m sure it’s nothing to you, but I’ve never had my lungs try to burn me alive from the inside out before.

I survived, though. And you know the rest. I’m not sure exactly how it manifested on your end. You certainly seemed to get the message.

I kept the circle, over the years, laced it through with signs and symbology of the Desolation to ward off the worst of the side effects, and keep its attentions elsewhere.

[Arthur laughs. It sounds more like a wheeze.]
ARTHUR
Don’t envy whoever broke it.

GERTRUDE
Yes. It went very badly for them, indeed.

ARTHUR
So where was it, in the end? I spent years looking for it.

GERTRUDE
(heh) Nowhere special. The middle of a forest in the Scottish highlands. Furthest place I could find from anything and anyone.

[Arthur laughs.]
ARTHUR
Yeah. Fair play. Not like we were ever gonna find that.

GERTRUDE
So. Your turn.

[Arthur shuffles around, sighs.]
ARTHUR
Go on.

GERTRUDE
What was Agnes like?

ARTHUR
What?

GERTRUDE
Well, for all the Web bound us together, I never actually met her. What was she like?

ARTHUR
I… I don’t know. Not really. You got as many answers to that as… folks who met her. Never really knew what she felt ‘bout any of it, not really. Not in her own words. Guess that’s the thing about being the… chosen one, or – I mean, Agnes was always quiet, but even if you spend all day, every day throwing out commandments and laying down parables… at the end of it, you’re always just the point of someone else’s story, everyone clamoring to say what you were, what you meant, and your thoughts on it all don’t mean nothing.

GERTRUDE
And were you this introspective when she was alive?

ARTHUR
Well that’s the thing about a fall from grace, innit? Makes you look at things from a… new angle. (pause) I miss her. (scoff) I’ll tell you that for nothing. Wish I – I don’t know. I’d actually known her, when she was alive. (long inhale) Maybe that coffeeshop twit did have a point after all. Couldn’t tell you what I saw, at least.

GERTRUDE
Which was?

ARTHUR
(steadying inhale) I saw the sun. So much – power and fire and rage inside of her, enough to burn the world and leave it nothing but desert. But to look at her, oh – It was too much for most. But it seemed so still, so stable. But it wasn’t calm. It was just – distant.

She never told us how she felt about being bound to you. Never even called you by name. Just called you her anchor. The thing weighing her down, tying her to this world and stopping her destiny.

GERTRUDE
Hm. I’m surprised you didn’t come for me immediately.

ARTHUR
(wheeze) Come for you? We ended up protecting you, more often than not. Diego was convinced if you died a violent death it would be catastrophic for Agnes. He even talked me around, and I spent decades convincing the others to wait it out. You couldn’t outrun age forever. And we had time. But it didn’t need to be forever, did it? Just long enough for a messiah to doubt. The sort of doubts that spread to her disciples.

You’ve never really had to bother with it, do you? You’ve got him upstairs to point the way as often as not, and the rest of the time you’re just figuring out people. Or things that used to be people.

You never try to talk with that Eye of yours. You’ve never had to second-guess a god. Because that’s what it comes down to, isn’t it? We feel it’s joy and it’s anger. It warps us and changes us and feeds on us. Though not in the ways we expect.

The one thing it never does is just… tell us what to do. It seeds us with this… aching, impossible desire to change the world, to bring it to us. Then it leaves us to guess and bicker and fight over how the hell you can actually do it. If it’s possible.

Sometimes I think they understand us as – little as we understand them. We don’t think like they do.

GERTRUDE
(noise of discontent) I’m not actually convinced they think at all.

ARTHUR
You might be right. But Agnes did. That’s the thing about an – incarnation, isn’t it? She was a child and – person as much as she was a god. And we messed that right up.e messed that right up.e messed that right up.

I still remember when Diego brought us a book on childcare. (dry laugh) Roger’s body was still in her room, blackened and smoking from when he tried to feed her. I thought he’d brought me another one of his damn Leitners, but no, it was just a regular old book on looking after children.

I was an idiot. Saw it as… attacking my leadership. Burnt the thing. Diego wasn’t happy. (louder) Well, he’s in charge now. (lower) All of us that are left at least. (louder again) He can look for answers in whatever books he likes, no skin off my nose.

GERTRUDE
I didn’t actually ask.

ARTHUR
(sigh) Figure if you’re gonna pull this stuff out of me, might as well get some of it off my chest anyway. (wheezy laugh) Not like I can vent to the others about what a prat Diego is. Got a lot of funny ideas. Still calls the Lightless Flame Asag, like he was when he was first researching it. I just really wanna tell him to get over it; I mean Asag was traditionally a force of destruction, sure, but as a church we very much settled on burning in terms of the – face we worship, and some fish-boiling Sumerian demon doesn’t really match up, does it? Plus there’s a lot of disease imagery with Asag that I’ll reckon is way too close to Filth for my taste, but no, he read it in some ancient tome, so that’s that –

GERTRUDE
(overlapping) Well, I can’t say I –

ARTHUR
(continuing over her) – reckons he always knows best, ‘cause he’s read a few books, well Big. Deal.

Way I see it, if a writer can’t even save themselves, they probably don’t have a lot worth knowing. Find me one so-called “expert” on all of this who didn’t end up regretting it.

That’s the trouble with overthinking any of this: You ignore your gut. And to my mind, that’s the only part any of them beyond actually care about. They don’t give a toss about your rules, or systems. They only care about what feels right, what freezes your belly with terror.

GERTRUDE
(heh) I rather like to think I’ve managed.

[Arthur wheeze-laughs again.]
ARTHUR
Yeah. But you don’t actually care about them, do you? Not really. You forget, we’ve been watching you a long time, and I know you, Gertrude. You don’t actually care about the fears. You’re too practical. All your energy is focused down here, on monsters, and murderers, and all the things doing the dirty work for them beyond.

You know plenty, sure, but you don’t have that – obsession, that stupid urge to try and understand and classify things that use logic and reality like weapons.

GERTRUDE
Hm. Per-Perhaps.

ARTHUR
(small laugh) Always respected you for that. Takes a strong stomach to not give a shit.

GERTRUDE
(heh) You’ll forgive me if I’m not overjoyed at the compliment.

ARTHUR
Suit yourself.

GERTRUDE
So. Now Diego has taken over; where does that leave you?

ARTHUR
(heh) Slumlording over a nest.

GERTRUDE
Oh. A nest of what?

ARTHUR
Found a mass of the Crawling Rot growing a while back. Managed to get ahold of the property before it became too big. Gotta wait ‘til it blossoms before we can properly burn it.

So ‘til then… just playing landlord.

It’s alright, I suppose. You’d be surprised the misery and pain you can cause when you’ve control over someone’s home. If you’re careful, if you’re smart, you can burn their life to ashes as thoroughly as any fire – and worst comes to worst, you can still do it the old-fashioned way.

Had an elderly tenant last year, oh, she was in a terrible state. I had her trapped, too poor and immobile to do anything but – sit there. Then I broke her boiler, so the cold started to get her.

Not exactly my usual, but… agony is agony. But then her son and his wife moved in with her to help her out. Not much I could do against that. So I just waited until all three were home, and set the place ablaze.

They went up nicely, screaming all the way as the flames started to reach them. Doors were locked, and handles were hot, so they didn’t have a chance of escape –

GERTRUDE
Yes, that’s – quite enough, I think.

ARTHUR
Oh, I’m sorry. There I was, thinking you liked the gory details. My mistake.

GERTRUDE
I think we’re just about done here.

ARTHUR
All your burning questions answered?

GERTRUDE
I’m certainly convinced you don’t know anything else useful.

ARTHUR
So – I’m free to go? You’re not gonna… you know.

GERTRUDE
(laugh, a bit too gleeful) I suppose you’ll have to wait and see.

ARTHUR
…Suppose I will.

GERTRUDE
You tell the others. Make sure they know what happened to Eugene.

ARTHUR
Sure. Can’t make any promises, though. ‘Specially for Jude. She really hates you.

GERTRUDE
Tell her she’s welcome to try. Oh, and I’m extending my protection to young Mr. Barnabas. They hurt him any more, then what happened to Eugene will seem like a mercy.

ARTHUR
(low, dangerous) You’re really pushing it, you know that?

GERTRUDE
(audible self-satisfied smirk) Hm. Feel free to push back. (harder) But until then, get out of my Archives.

[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
ARCHIVIST
(sigh) The more I listen, the more it seems to me we’re all just – groping about, trying desperately to find out what we’re actually meant to be doing.

These things that – loom so large over our lives trap us and push us and – sometimes kill us. But they never actually tell us what we’re supposed to be doing. So we scheme and we plot, lash out at each other without ever really knowing why.

I think Gertrude knew this, knew to focus her attention on those parts that could be understood, and – well. And killed.

But I’m really starting to worry that there aren’t any answers. Not like I want there to be. There aren’t any answers in Ny-Ålesund; there aren’t any answers in the past – I’ve been inside the Buried, and there were no answers there.

Elias always seemed to know what was going on, to have a plan, but… I sometimes wonder how orchestrated some of it really was. (sigh) (faster) We’ve been back in London for just over a week now. I’m – more or less recovered physically; it’s just this nagging sense of unease that won’t leave me.

I was… so sure I’d find something up there. But instead it was just another broken person trying to come to terms with the wreckage of their life.

And here? I reached out, I took another tape, hoping for a bit of guidance, but – (short sigh) To be honest, this hasn’t helped.

I did some more digging into Eugene Vanderstock. I thought he was still alive, and – (inhale) – working at the steel plant, but it looks like he’s just listed on one of the old directory pages on their website.

I really miss having people who know their way around a computer better than I do.

[Long pause.]
ARCHIVIST
A bit more digging found a… rather bizarre case. Apparently he disappeared in late 2009, leaving behind only one thing: a life-sized statue of himself, crafted from candlewax and sawdust. Missing its head.

I wish I didn’t know how painful it must be to be alive while your entire being is infused with… agonizing grit. But, as I was investigating, it… came to me.

Eugene is still alive, frozen in place by the razor-sharp particles that are mixed up into what he chose instead of flesh.

I don’t know where Gertrude stored his head. But I do know it desperately wants to scream. (inhale) Perhaps I c–

ARCHIVIST
Oh – G-Georgie! Wh-What a – You… –

GEORGIE
(overlapping) Oh! Uh, sorry; I thought, um – Is Melanie about?

ARCHIVIST
…Melanie? Uh – Yeah, I saw her a couple of hours ago – Uh, in the other office, I can, I can show you?

GEORGIE
Oh, I’m – sure I can find it. Don’t worry yourself.

ARCHIVIST
A-All right. (incomprehensible noise as he gets his bearings) W,Why are you, uh, well – here? I-If it’s not too personal a question.

[Short pause.]
GEORGIE
It is, a bit. It’s not really my place to discuss it.

ARCHIVIST
Ah, oh, therapy! You’re taking her to therapy.

GEORGIE
She – told you then?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, yes, yeah.

GEORGIE
Well, you don’t need to sound quite so psyched about it. (rustle of clothing) She gets – nervous traveling there alone.

ARCHIVIST
(inhale) Yes, o-o-of course. I-I forget you two know each other.

[Long silence, during which the Archivist lets a quiet um cross his lips.]
GEORGIE
So – (breaks off, pause) How are you doing?

ARCHIVIST
I’m… I’m alright. I’m trying to, uh, rest up a bit. Take it easy.

[He exhales.]
GEORGIE
Really? ‘Cause – I’m pretty sure I heard talking about a screaming headless corpse just now.

ARCHIVIST
Oh – Oh, were you… listening? –

GEORGIE
Oh, um. Didn’t mean to, you know. These doors are not that thick.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. I’m deep in it. Had some – close calls.

GEORGIE
(fast) I’m sorry to hear that. You should probably get some therapy too.

[The Archivist inhales quickly, as if surprised.]
ARCHIVIST
Would you go with me as well?

GEORGIE
…No.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. I thought as much.

GEORGIE
It’s the other office, you say.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of Marcus McKenzie, regarding a series of unexplored entryways. Original statement given September 1st, 2003. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
So my dad tells me he’s been bothering you with his nonsense? (sigh) I just wanted to come over and set things straight. Apologize for any of your time that he might have wasted.

He’s… just a lonely old man looking for attention and trying to manipulate me into moving back in with him, even though I’ve told him so many times that that’s just not going to happen. (sigh) The doors thing isn’t even his, you know? That’s what he talked to you about, right? Some magically-appearing door.

Yeah, well, he’s just trying to send me a message. Which has been received, loud and clear.

I suppose I do probably owe you some sort of explanation. (big sigh) Right.

I’d been living with my parents… a while. I kept moving out, but it never seemed to stick. First was uni – fine, moving in after a degree is normal. Then there was my divorce, back in ‘93, that landed me back in my old room for a while, then my company went bust about four years ago and wiped out all my savings.

All told, I must have spent most of my twenties, and not a small amount of my thirties, living in that house with my mum and dad.

It was alright, but each time the vibe was worse. My mum was always happy to have me, but she wanted me to move on with my life. But dad was weirdly protective of me, kept trying to keep me around, like he was terrified that the world outside was going to hurt me.

I was – quite depressed, back then, and his attitude put me in a really… weird headspace. I think it comes back to the doors, you know? I think he always secretly thought that I had some deep-seated mental illness, even though they did so many tests, and the doors were the only thing that there ever was – aside from the depression, obviously.

But they were just specific, weird little hallucinations that have long since stopped. Haven’t had one in… well, it’s not important.

But my dad always thought it was a sign of something deeper, something that was – something that was going to destroy me, someday. So whenever I was living at home, he smothered me, tried desperately to keep me around.

Don’t you see? That’s what this whole thing has been about; he’s been so lonely since mum died, and he’s been trying to get me to move back in with him. He’s pretending that he is starting to see the doors. He thinks that if he starts to share in my “madness,” as he always calls it, then I’ll be worried about it; I’ll stick around.

But I’m not mad, and he’s not seeing any doors. I’m sorry he’s so lonely, truly, I am – I try to see him as much as I can, but – I have my own life, and I can’t be there all the time. And I don’t like being manipulated. I don’t like being lied to.

The first door I remember seeing that shouldn’t have been there, must have been when I was five or six. I had a skipping rope, bright green, old and ratty. I made my mum buy it for me at a car boot sale, and I loved it. I could spend hours on the playground, just stood there jumping happily. We weren’t really supposed to bring our own toys to school, but no one stopped me.

It was thicker, heavier, than the ones all the other kids had, a proper rope that needed a good bit of strength to really swing. I was fiercely proud of it.

So one night – it was during the Christmas holidays, so I must have been six – I wake up. There’s a noise in my room, like something being dragged along the floor. Well, I look over, and in the weak orange glow of my nightlight, I can see the heavy wooden handle of my skipping rope moving slowly across the floorboards and out my bedroom door.

I don’t remember panicking. I’m not even sure I was scared, not at that point. But I didn’t like anyone except my friends touching my toys, so I got up and hurried to follow.

I chased it sleepily out of my bedroom and down the hall, past the stairs and towards… a doorway I didn’t recognize. I was sure that when I’d gone to bed, it’d been a patch of wall, with a painting of an old sailboat on it. But now it was an open doorway.

A small amount of light leaked from around the edges of the door through to my parents room behind me. But it didn’t reach very far at all, and beyond the threshold, it was completely dark.

That was when I started to feel scared.

I could see the wooden handle of my skipping rope lying in the corridor, its heavy green cord stretching out and into the door, until it disappeared in the darkness.

I realized I was shaking. I didn’t want to go through that door. So I picked up the handle, and started to gently pull on it, try to drag it back out again. Instead of moving, the line went taut. Something was holding the other end, and it was trying to pull me.

For one, awful moment, I found myself frozen in a tug-of-war with whatever was inside that door, clinging desperately to that rope as it stretched away and vanished into blackness. But I was six, and felt myself starting to lose my footing and fall towards it, so I did the only thing I could: I let go, and I watched my most treasured possession disappear forever as the door closed behind it, and I ran back to bed.

I told my parents, of course, but they didn’t believe me. They just thought I’d lost it, and was making up wild stories to cover it up. The wall was the wall again, and the picture of the old sailing boat was back where it should have been.

The next time, I was eleven, and that time, the door wasn’t really there. Well, it was, but it was – covered in concrete.

It – It was in this old alleyway, about five minutes walk from my house, and one of the buildings was this abandoned warehouse. I – At least I think it was a warehouse. The wooden signs were rotted away, and the windows had all been broken – and the main layer had been covered in a grey layer of perfectly smooth concrete.

I passed it on the way home from school almost every day, and something about that blank, grey space where a door should have been always gave me a shiver of unease.

Then one day I was walking past, and the door that stole my skipping rope was there. The thing was, though, I couldn’t see it, because it was still covered in that concrete, but I knew it was there. Before, there’d been nothing behind it, but now, I was certain; now in the center of the concrete were five clear marks, as though someone had pressed their fingers into the mixture when it had still been wet.

I stood there, staring at it like I had all those years ago. It was playing with me again, but this time, it wasn’t looking to play with a skipping rope. This time, it was a dare. It was daring me to put my own hand on that rough concrete, to fit my fingers into the hollow spaces it had made for me, and open it.

It was a windy afternoon, but for that moment the narrow street where I stood was completely still. I could feel the muscles in my arm tensing, preparing to stretch towards it, to accept the dare from a door that had hidden itself so sneakily under all that concrete.

Then my friend Luke yelled at me from the end of the street. The fear was gone in a second, and I ran to catch up with him. I did, however, make the mistake of telling my parents about it, and reminding them of the other time it had happened when I was six.

This time, they didn’t dismiss it so quickly. First, they checked the alleyway, and took some pictures of the solid, unmarked concrete of the covered entry. Then, they began to make appointments, and sent me to specialists. I was tested and poked and quizzed and prodded all through my teenage years.

I never believed I was delusional, not like that, no matter what my father said, and neither, it seemed, did the doctors – at least, not in any way they could prove. Every test, every examination seemed to reinforce the fact that there was nothing medically unusual about me or my mind.

The only evidence to the contrary was the fact that I – kept seeing the door.

When I was thirteen, it was underneath a railway bridge. It was huge and metal this time, with solid iron bolts sealing it shut and a thick chain stretched across it. The warning stickers had long since scrubbed off, and someone had scrawled in chalk “WARNING: Danger of Death.”

As I passed, something heavy began to bang on the side, sending the chain dancing. It pounded again and again, and I didn’t know if it was trying to force its way out, or politely knocking, hoping to be let in.

When I was fifteen, I pressed the doorbell for Sandra’s house, picking her up for our first date, and I realized that it sounded wrong, like the doorbell was echoing through a hundred empty corridors, bouncing back and forth and lingering in the air. I looked again at their front door, and realized that it didn’t lead to their house.

I heard footsteps approaching on the other side from the far distance, fast and steady, but getting closer. I turned and ran, just as I heard the door open behind me.

When I was sixteen, I was stumbling home drunk from a house party, and I found it lying open in the ground in front of me. It was wide, waiting, and I could see a long corridor stretching down and away, at a right angle to the world as I knew it, turning off into an angular labyrinth.

I was trying so hard to walk carefully, to seem like I wasn’t drunk, that I almost didn’t notice it until it was too late. I stared into it for a long time, my eyes hazy from cheap vodka, and I saw a shape walking calmly along the vertical floor.

When I was eighteen, I was driving a group of friends to a concert in Leeds when we pulled into a service station to get some lunch. They didn’t hear the scream coming from the small stone structure just next to where all the coaches parked. They didn’t see the drag marks that led across the tarmac and under the door.

I didn’t eat lunch that day.

The last time was the worst. It hadn’t happened for almost fifteen years, and when I saw it, I almost wept.

It was when I was living in Oxford, up Cowley Way. A few streets over, there was an empty plot of land, just scrubby plants and junk. If there’d ever been a house there, it was long gone. A few of the older residents said it burned down in the seventies, but they were always… real weird about it. I passed it whenever I was heading down to get a drink at the City Arms.

The last week before I had to move back in with my parents, I was at my lowest point. I was bankrupt in all but name, the work of almost half a decade flushed down the toilet, and all that remained of my worldly possessions were packed up for yet another return to childhood.

And as I passed that empty space of grass, there it was: a pale yellow door, stood all alone, like the entrance to a house that I just couldn’t see. It had no frame around it, but I was sure that if I grasped its handle and twisted, it would still swing open, silent and inviting.

This wasn’t like before; there was no playfulness here, none of that malicious joy that I had always felt coming off it. Now there was just a cold hunger, a deep anger, as though I had no right to just stand there looking at it. The street was silent, but I could feel it screaming at me to open it.

I just about managed to not to. I was just about able to walk away.

I’m… sorry; I didn’t mean to get so deep into my issues. I’m not mad; I know that. It’s just, this door is something else. And my father knows that; it’s why he used it as a cornerstone of his little story, but it’s just – pretend. He just wants me to move back in with him. And I can’t. I just – can’t.

Sometimes you just have to leave. Even if what’s on the other side scares you.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends. (long sigh)

So it seems we did have Marcus McKenzie’s statement after all. I spent so long looking for it, back when I found his father’s and – (long inhale) – no luck.

But now I decide to start looking properly into Hill Top Road, and all of a sudden I’m drawn to rearrange a filing cabinet, and what do I find behind it?

I never thought I’d miss those days, when I could throw out some half-baked speculation about drug abuse or mental illness and whoosh – away all the statements went.

There is nothing in the world more reassuring than ignorance, which we can mistake for certainty.

But no. Almost every one of those statements, those – people. That poor old man.

Like I can talk. Like I’m in any position to mourn the suffering of the innocent.

But there is one thing I know an awful lot better now, than I did when I read his father’s statement:

I know an awful lot more about doors.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. HELEN’S DOOR]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The Archivist bangs impatiently on Helen’s door, breaths heaving, until Helen indeed opens it.]
HELEN
You rang?

[There’s a persistent static in the background from the moment the door opens.]
ARCHIVIST
Marcus McKenzie. Why didn’t you tell me?

HELEN
Is that name supposed to mean something to me?

ARCHIVIST
(half laugh, half shudder) No. I suppose it wouldn’t. Just an old man and his son for you to terrorize and feast on.

HELEN
(all business) Oh, well; the son, I was pursuing long before I was even Michael. And technically, I didn’t eat the old man. He passed away from terror long before I got a chance to open properly.

ARCHIVIST
His son Marcus – he – he was fine when I read his father’s statement two years ago, but now, suddenly, I can’t get through to him.

HELEN
No. I imagine not. I decided it was time to finish that game a few months ago.

ARCHIVIST
You – Why?

HELEN
Not sure. I suppose Helen didn’t have quite the same attachment to him as a project. I’m not quite as much for decades-long campaigns of subtle terror these days.

ARCHIVIST
(soft) That’s horrible.

HELEN
Is it? We do what we need to do when it comes to feeding, don’t we? (pointed) Don’t we, Archivist?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

HELEN
It would be better if you embraced it.

ARCHIVIST
It’s not – Look, why were you trying to lure him into Hill Top Road?

HELEN
That? Oh. Well. That was just curiosity. I wanted to see what would happen.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t understand.

HELEN
There is something wrong with Hill Top Road. You know it as well as I do. Some strange scar on reality at the center of – whatever it is that the Spider is spinning.

When young Mr. McKenzie passed, it seemed like a good opportunity for an experiment, to see what would happen if I lured him inside.

But it seems I just don’t have the Web’s gift for manipulation. Persuasion.

ARCHIVIST
Were you controlled?

HELEN
What a delightful thought. (short pause) I don’t believe so, no. But the Spider’s strings are subtle, so I suppose it’s not impossible. Why?

ARCHIVIST
I, I want to know: Can the Web control another avatar, one that serves a different power?

[Helen begins to laugh.]
ARCHIVIST
Make them do things they don’t want to, make them –

[He breaks off; Helen is clearly getting to him.]
ARCHIVIST
– find victims, feed –

[Helen keeps laughing.]
HELEN
Oh, perhaps. Perhaps not. Would that make life easier for you? Are you so sure you didn’t want to?

[The Archivist starts breathing harder and heavier, as Helen erupts back into laughter. She closes the door behind her.]

Been a while since you’ve all come to see me together. I assume it’s not good news.

DAISY
No.

MELANIE
(spitting) What the hell have you been doing, John?

BASIRA
(cold, cold anger) Martin left a tape for us.

ARCHIVIST
And what exactly is on this t–

[He cuts off; Basira’s pulled the tape out, and one way or another, he knows what’s on it.]
ARCHIVIST
(exhale) Oh.

MELANIE
Yes.

BASIRA
How many?

ARCHIVIST
Basira… I –

BASIRA
How many?

[Short pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Four.

MELANIE
Jesus.

BASIRA
Including the one on the boat?

DAISY
What one on the boat?

ARCHIVIST
Including Floyd? Five.

MELANIE
Jesus!

BASIRA
Do I even want to know?

MELANIE
I do.

[The Archivist sighs.
ARCHIVIST
Jess Tyrell, the woman on the tape – (sigh) – she was the fourth. I – I just tried to – I was weak. R-Ravenous, I,I,I didn’t feel –

The first was a supermarket cleaner, um, ended up lost for a week in an endless warehouse.

[In the background, we hear Melanie sigh.]
ARCHIVIST
I didn’t even – I, I just went in for some shopping, and he was there, and I just – asked. (inhale) The second was… it was after I got stabbed by Melanie.

MELANIE
You are not putting this on me –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) No, that’s not what I meant. (shaky inhale) I was walking the streets; I – I thought I was trying to clear my head…

DAISY
But you were hunting.

ARCHIVIST
Apparently. I, I found a woman who, every year on her birthday, wakes up in a fresh grave, just for her.

DAISY
And the third was after the coffin.

ARCHIVIST
A man rejected by all who knew him, (inhale) searching ever-darker places for love. When he told me his story, he started weeping maggots.

BASIRA
Enough.

[In the background, Melanie makes a disgusted noise.]
ARCHIVIST
I hope so.

MELANIE
(exhale) Why didn’t you record them?

BASIRA
Why do you think? Because he was ashamed.

ARCHIVIST
(immediately) No; I-I mean, I don’t record anything anymore, not, not really; I just sort of assume they’ll turn on if it’s important.

BASIRA
Well, they didn’t.

ARCHIVIST
No, I suppose not.

[Silence, uncomfortable and tight.]
[Melanie eventually breaks it with a sigh.]
MELANIE
So. What do we do now?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know.

BASIRA
You’re a danger, John. A monster. You’re hurting innocent people.

ARCHIVIST
So did Daisy.

BASIRA
Shut up. It’s not the same thing at all.

DAISY
Basira. He has a point.

BASIRA
You didn’t know what you were doing.

[Daisy makes a pained sound, as if to contradict her, but stops.]
BASIRA
And since you did, you’ve spent every waking hour resisting. He knows exactly what he’s doing.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t – It’s not that simple, i-i-it feels – (pause as he finds his words) I don’t know if I can control it; I don’t know if it’s even me doing it.

BASIRA
So you say you’re being controlled.

ARCHIVIST
I-I don’t know. Maybe. Th-The Web, i–

BASIRA
(overlapping) What, What was the name you said before? Annabelle Cane.

ARCHIVIST
…Yes, uh, she’s – she’s been watching us, I’m pretty sure of it.

MELANIE
John, I – I’m not sure that it’s actually the –

BASIRA
(overlapping) No. No, if he is being controlled, we need to know. And we need to know now. Do you know where she is?

ARCHIVIST
(struggling) N-Not – Not properly, I,I – I think she has some connection to Hill Top Road.

BASIRA
Then we go. Now. Unless, anyone has any objections?

[Lots of exhaling and rustling in the background. Melanie begins to say something, but –]
ARCHIVIST
Not from me.

BASIRA
(overlapping) You don’t get a vote.

MELANIE
Uh, okay, seriously – I’m going to have to be the one to point out that this is a terrible idea.

BASIRA
(determined inhale) Daisy?

DAISY
Be better if we could prepare.

MELANIE
I-I just think – that – we shouldn’t be exposing ourselves like this until we have a little bit more than a hunch.

ARCHIVIST
She does have a point.

MELANIE
I – didn’t ask you.

[John sighs.]
BASIRA
‘kay, fine, I’ll go, then. I’ll do some recon on my own, and update you.

[As she speaks, she pushes out of her seat and heads for the door.]
MELANIE
Wait, hang on!

DAISY
Basira…

BASIRA
I’ll tell you all what I find. Don’t let him eat anyone’s brain while I’m gone.

ARCHIVIST
(sullen) That’s not what I do.

[Basira opens the door.]

Well, that was…

Shut up.

(half a question, half statement) So, we’re going with her.

DAISY
(sigh) Come on, Mel. I’ll see if I’ve got a stab vest in your size.

[Melanie pushes out of her seat as she talks.]
MELANIE
Yeah. Sure.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. OXFORD, 105 HILL TOP ROAD]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
BASIRA
Heads up.

ARCHIVIST
The tape.

[A couple of footsteps.]
BASIRA
Something’s here.

MELANIE
No shit! Look at this place.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[There’s a sound like a door being closed in the background; it seems like someone, likely Daisy, is checking over the house. The Archivist sighs. As he does:]
MELANIE
When did you say they finished rebuilding?

ARCHIVIST
2008?

[More footsteps.]
ARCHIVIST
Doesn’t look like anyone ever moved in, though.

BASIRA
So this is – ten years of cobwebs?

DAISY
More than that.

[Footsteps.
MELANIE
(heavy sarcasm) No, I’m sure this is just the normal number of webs that grow up organically.

BASIRA
So – where are all the spiders?

MELANIE
I – I mean, they hide.

[More footsteps.]
MELANIE
You know, it’s a thing they do, spiders; they hide.

DAISY
Perhaps they bugged out.

[Slight pause, but for footsteps.]
ARCHIVIST
Was that a joke?

BASIRA
John, focus. Are you getting any sense of anything? Can you… See anything?

ARCHIVIST
No, I’m just seeing what you’re seeing. Still a bit weak from my trip up north, to be honest.

MELANIE
(drier than the Sahara) Sorry we couldn’t stop for a snack.

[Basira snickers. The Archivist sighs.]
[Footsteps again, and Daisy hands them all something.]
DAISY
Here, Mel.

MELANIE
What even are these?

DAISY
Magnesium flares. Technically not legal anymore; if you need more, just shout.

MELANIE
Oh. Fine. Uh – and, and – please don’t call me Mel.

DAISY
What? Since when?

MELANIE
Always. I’m – (sigh) – trying to be more open about this stuff.

DAISY
Roger wilco, Miss King.

MELANIE
(hm) Better.

[A door opens.]
BASIRA
These flares going to work?

DAISY
No idea, but John said the Web doesn’t get on great with fire, and we don’t exactly have a flamethrower, so –

BASIRA
I mean, at least until we find the one Gertrude stocked up.

[Someone shakily exhale-laughs in the background.]
BASIRA
Right next to the nukes.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sure the flares will work fine. (slight pause) I mean, un, unless it’s all an elaborate plan to have us burn this place down again.

BASIRA
So what if it is?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t follow.

BASIRA
I mean, anything we do could be part of the “grand master plan.” So, what – we do nothing? Just sit on our hands and hope that’s not what the Spider wants?

[The Archivist sighs. But it’s Melanie that jumps in:]
MELANIE
Right, sure, but it wouldn’t hurt to have a bit more of a plan, would it?

ARCHIVIST
Exactly.

BASIRA
You want to come back later?

MELANIE
(insistent/explosive) Yes! That’s what I said, isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
(large sigh) Well, we’re here now. Might as well push on.

MELANIE
(narrowed eyes) Famous last words.

[Another door is opened; Daisy emerges and shuts it behind her.]
DAISY
Clear. Looks like nothing downstairs.

BASIRA
You wanna – take a moment before we head up?

ARCHIVIST
What about the basement?

DAISY
Can’t see one.*

[* As a matter of course, music cues tend not to be noted in episode transcripts. However, the cue of high, tremulous violin that comes in the moment Daisy finishes speaking is both surprising and, subsequently, chilling enough that I felt it ought to be mentioned here.]
ARCHIVIST
Huh.

DAISY
You want me to take point?

ARCHIVIST
Uh – no. No, I’ve, I’ve got it.

[They all begin to take the stairs; the Archivist’s steps are heavy, and the stairs creak under his weight. As he continues climbing, breaths coming heavy, a strangely familiar voice begins to resolve from the background.]
ARCHIVIST
You hear that?

BASIRA
No, I don’t hear –

MELANIE
(shushes vigorously) Yes! Room on the left.

[The voice resolves completely.]
[It’s the Archivist.]
[His voice is clearly on tape, and it soon becomes clear that the recording playing is that of case #0122204 (MAG #1: “Anglerfish.”)]
[The following excerpt plays, and gains in volume, as the others speak over it:]
ARCHIVIST (RECORDING)
– organisation dedicated to academic research into the esoteric and the paranormal. The head of the Institute, Mr. Elias Bouchard, has employed me to replace the previous Head Archivist, one Gertrude Robinson, who has recently passed away.

MELANIE
Is that? –

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
Don’t touch it.

ARCHIVIST
It’s alright.

[He steels himself with a bracing breath, hesitates for a moment, then – turns the tape off.]
DAISY
Something underneath it.

ARCHIVIST
I see it. Uh – Hand me that brush?

[He begins to retrieve the object.]
BASIRA
Is – that what I think it is?

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Yep.

[He holds the object up; we hear it rustle.]
ARCHIVIST
Official Institute paper and everything.

[He exhales.]
BASIRA
Goddamnit.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of Annabelle Cane. She left it for us.

MELANIE
Honestly don’t know what else you guys were expecting.

BASIRA
Well, that’s it, then.

[The Archivist lets out a shaky breath.]
BASIRA
Come on, let’s finish up and get out of here.

ARCHIVIST
I – I mean – Are we burning it?

MELANIE
The statement or the building?

DAISY
Both?

BASIRA
Don’t tempt me.

[The girls all laugh.]

ARCHIVIST
Statement of – (sigh) – Annabelle Cane. Regarding her history and her observations of the Magnus Institute, London. Original statement written 20th July, 2018. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Free will is a funny old thing, isn’t it John? Can I call you John? I’m going to call you John.

Such a strange concept, woven from a thousand different ignorances and experiences, a faculty we only ever truly ascribe to ourselves, and – I suppose, to our gods.

With any other animal, we talk about instinct, we talk about training; perhaps, if we have spent enough time with them, we talk about personality. But we never talk about choice. We never look at a dog chasing wildly after a thrown ball and think “What an odd decision that dog has made.”

We talk about workings of its mind, and instincts; if it doesn’t chase the ball, we wonder why: Is it sick, is it tired? Perhaps something in the nature of this particular breed, this particular dog, makes it prone to ignoring a game of fetch.

The idea of a dog simply choosing not to chase feels deeply unnatural. Is it even capable of legitimately making a decision; some would say no.

Of course, people are very different from dogs. Our brains are larger. More complex. So many more little factors and wrinkles to push us and pull us – but does any of that actually constitute free will?

Free of what? We all have forces that drive us, circumstances that direct us, and even if we choose to ignore these and act against all logic, just to prove that we can – is that not simply allowing the existential terror of our own powerlessness to control us instead?

Scans show decisions are made by your brain long before your conscious mind even has a chance to register them. Most of one’s life is simply spent looking back and convincing yourself that you chose deliberately to act like you did.

Hm. Have you ever read War and Peace, John? I know, I know; I had to read an extract for a literature class once, ended up reading the whole thing.

Another life.

It’s not actually as boring as people say, and its central thesis is that the tiniest, most insignificant factors can control the destiny of the world.

In its post-script, Tolstoy muses on the concept of free will, on whether or not he really believes in it. He ultimately decides that if all the millions upon millions of factors that weigh upon our choices were fully and completely known, then all could be foreseen and predetermined.

But, he argues, it is quite impossible for the human mind to comprehend even a fraction of these. And in that vast, dark space of ignorance lies: free will.

Isn’t that marvelous, John? Free will is simply ignorance. It’s just the name we give to the fact that no one can ever really see everything that controls them.

Of course, that’s not the real crux of the free will question that’s bothering you at the moment, is it? I think that one probably comes down to whether or not you’re choosing to continue reading this statement out loud.

You didn’t mean to, did you? No, I’m sure you told Basira and Melanie that you were going to glance over it and report back; perhaps they asked you if you were going to record, and you shook your head: maybe later.

That sounds like the sort of thing you’d say.

But think about it, John; when’s the last time you were able to read a statement quietly to yourself without instinctively hitting record and speaking it aloud? Is it just instinct, habit? Or is it a compulsion, a string pulled by the Ceaseless Watcher or the Mother of Puppets?

Or both?

I know the summaries have started to confuse you; where did they come from, when you read a statement fresh? How do you just – know what it’s about, before you even start to read it?

But by then you’re away; the roller coaster is dropping, and you’ve no real choice but to hold on and hope that – I don’t crash you.

I’m afraid I don’t actually have these answers for you; I’ve simply been… watching. I’m sure you understand that.

Maybe I’ve occasionally been nudging something here and there to keep you safe, to keep everything on track. But I know you’ve been more worried about your choices, about whether you’re being controlled by me, or by the Mother.

So I thought perhaps I should leave a little something to reassure you that, yes, your actions and choices have all been your own.

Have they been controlled? No more than gravity controls you when you walk, or hunger controls you when you choose your meal. There are certainly new forces, new instincts and desires, that shape your actions; perhaps you’re unprepared for them.

But if you choose to believe in a free will, then yes: All you have done has been of your own free will. They have all been your choices.

Now, I believe the tradition is to tell you the story of my life, the sinister path that led me to the sorry state in which I now find myself.

Well, let it never be said that I do not dance the steps I am assigned.

I was born into what most would consider a large family. My father worked constantly, and my mother was overwhelmed, leaving some of the older children to watch over the younger ones. Some rose to this responsibility; others deeply resented it and took no pains to hide the fact.

I was one of the youngest, and it soon became clear to my infant mind that in order to get anywhere, the key was to navigate the baroque family politics in which I found myself.

I became very good at it. I would instigate fights between siblings if I needed them in trouble. If I required sympathy, I would bite myself until I drew blood, and then blame it on my sister Lizzie. I discovered a deep and enduring talent inside myself for lying.

My manipulations were not intricate, but they were far beyond what was expected of a child my age, and I have always believed that the key to manipulating people is to ensure that they always under- or over-estimate you. Never reveal your true abilities or plans.

Of course, I learned many of my skills from my mother, who could wield guilt like a rapier and anger like a scalpel. She never simply screamed at you. She was always aware of exactly what kind of fury or disappointment was needed to make sure you regretted ever catching her attention. She had eight children, yet weaved that life around herself in such a way that she always seemed both the victim of it, yet curiously divorced of any responsibility.

In many ways, she was the victim, at least of my father, whose pathological absence spoke of a man who had no interest whatsoever in engaging with the life where he had trapped his family.

However well I had learned my lessons, it was clear that happiness was not something I could have; within that family there was simply too much that I couldn’t control.

My biggest attempt to assert some sort of influence over my family was when I decided to run away. In my childish mind, I was certain that my disappearance would destabilize the entire family unit, allowing me to take my rightful place as the most important child upon my return.

An infantile fantasy, perhaps, but one I was keen to realize. I intended to stay away for two days and two nights. I took a backpack and filled it with as much food as I could carry (which was barely enough for a decent lunch,) my favorite blanket, and the only book I could say belonged to only me: Five Go Down to the Sea. And then I left.

We lived in Hunstanton, in Norfolk, about twenty minutes walk from the beach, and it was late spring, so I wasn’t at all worried about the temperature.

I had chosen where I was to spend the two days I disappeared some weeks before. The air was warm and humid as I snuck out of the house, filled with that slight scent of salt that even now, changed as I am, I sometimes find myself missing here, in the grimy air of London.

If you walked down the short hill from Hunstanton Town Centre and towards the beach, and took a right just before you reached it, you could find yourself on a small stretch of sand that seemed oddly quiet.

Most days, it was completely deserted, and even on those holidays where the number of sunbathers was so high no part of the beach could fully escape them, it would only have a handful of dedicated loungers lying around, quietly reading and studiously ignoring their own unease.

Exactly why it remained like that and no one seemed to notice – still a mystery to me, even now. But whatever the cause, it was a shunned place, and sitting on the side of the road above it, casting a thick, angular shadow, was the squat brick structure of the old chip shop.

I’d never seen it open. No one had, as far as I could tell. It was painted a dark blue, that never quite matched any color of sky that was behind it, and had a hand-lettered sign that could still be seen covering much of the bare left hand wall in curling, faded typeface.

CHIPS, it said.

The old chip shop had been around longer than I’d been alive, probably longer, and its silent one-story silhouette had always unsettled me. It was only looking back that I realized how few windows it had: Just one, tiny panel of glass either side of the big doors. The rest of the structure was just – plain, unadorned brickwork.

I don’t really know why I decided to hide there, but assuming you’ve been paying attention, I’m sure you understand by now how little that means. Perhaps deep down, I simply knew it would be unlocked.

The sun was setting by the time I reached it, and if there had been any tourists trying to enjoy the beach in that place, they were long since gone. I was utterly alone, the only sound a few distant seagulls screaming to be fed as they circled aimlessly looking for food.

Against the vivid red-orange of the sky, the old chip shop seemed almost black, like a fallen obelisk. A light rain began to patter down, and I, not having had the foresight to pack an umbrella, ran to it.

I opened the door as quickly and quietly as I could. Inside it was warm and dry, and dust coated everything. I struggled more than once not to sneeze, something I was convinced would somehow alert my family to where I was. So I crawled under one of the counters, and soon enough, sleep had come for me.

I awoke to the sound of rhythmic clattering, the noise of wood striking wood in a complex, intricate pattern. I got up, more curious than fearful at that moment, and took few, tentative steps towards it.

The sound seemed to be coming from one of the back rooms, and seeing as how light seeped from only one of the doors, it seemed to me pretty obvious which room contained my answer.

So I went inside. Another action which, looking back after the fact, I found myself pleasingly baffled by.

Inside was a young woman I did not recognize, sat at what I would later learn was an old-fashioned wooden loom. Her eyes and face were sunken, her hands and arms a blur as the machine pressed on. They arced over and through the loom, and I could see much of her inner forearms and legs were covered in tiny holes, small red pinpricks like insect bites.

Looking back, of course, and remembering the crunch of used syringes beneath my feet, I realize that addiction is one of the strongest vectors of control there is.

The woman looked up at me, disinterested, and I saw that the threads of the loom were laced into her skin, all through her track marks, and that dozens of spiders ran up and down those weaving threads and scurried in and out of the holes in her skin.

Her eyes met mine, and traveled upwards towards the ceiling. I followed her gaze for barely five seconds before I fled home, and abandoned my plans to run away entirely.

I may have decided not to describe what I saw up there. I will only say that it is what engendered in me that terror of spiders which eventually led to my volunteering at Surrey University!

I will simply say that – when a spider reaches a certain size, it is often not entirely made up of spider anymore.

So how much free will was involved in that story? What could I have chosen to change? Would a different path have been possible?

I felt no loss of control, no puppet strings guided me. And yet, the Mother got exactly the result she no doubt wanted, one that would lead to a fear of spiders so acute that I could later have that horror focused and refined into a silk-spun apotheosis.

Unless, of course, none of it was intentional. None of it was planned. The Mother is the fear of manipulation and lost control made manifest. So perhaps it is our fear that projects her influence on everything that happens.

Like the mind: retrospectively assigning reason to our actions, so we fit whatever occurs into the neatest pattern we can, and declare her web both intricate and complete.

Perhaps she is no more active than Terminus, simply sitting and reveling in the inevitable cascade of paranoia, as those who hold her in special terror cocoon themselves in red string and theory.

Or perhaps I am simply telling you what you need to hear in order to ensure you behave exactly as the Mother wishes you to.

Perhaps I have never even seen a beach.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Don’t go to Hill Top Road again.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

That was, uh… I didn’t – I, I, I didn’t like that. I couldn’t –

[He cuts himself off, seems to struggle, then makes a frustrated noise.]
ARCHIVIST
So. She is watching the Institute. Interfering with things. (slight soft gasp, more of frustration than surprise) Is that reassuring, or merely really bad?

I can’t say I’m… I can’t say I’m sad to have another ally allegedly on our side, but I don’t like the idea of being important to the Web.

That’s a really bad place to be.

Annabelle’s right, though. I mean, I can’t trust anything she says to not be another lie to further manipulate and maneuver us, but deep down I think she’s right.

What I’ve been doing to these people, it – it hasn’t been because I was puppeted, or controlled, or possessed.

I wanted to do it. It felt good.

But at least I know I can stop; I just – don’t know how. I – (he sighs) I don’t – want to stop. (ugh) Goddamn, this one really took it out of me. I need to go lie down. (uh) End recording.

ELIAS
Good evening, Detective.

[BASIRA IMMEDIATELY ASSAULTS HIM.]
Ow!

BASIRA
Useless, scheming piece of shit!

ELIAS
– Detective, this is quite unnecessary –

[ANGRY NOISE]
[FURTHER VIOLENCE]
BASIRA
I’m sorry, was that unnecessary?

ELIAS
Ow!

BASIRA
Because this is the most helpful you’ve been so far!

Unless you’ve got another crisis for me.

ELIAS
[gasping] No, no, no – it’s fine… I’m sorry?

BASIRA
Oh, yeah? For which part?

ELIAS
…all of it?

BASIRA
You sent us to the North fucking Pole for no goddamn reason!

ELIAS
A, um, miscalculation –

BASIRA
No, no, I’m done with your game –

ELIAS
That’s – Basira –

BASIRA
And when exactly were you planning to tell us he’s been feeding on innocents?!

ELIAS
– I’ve – I’ve always thought that a man’s eating habits were his own private business –

BASIRA
Mm-hm.

ELIAS
– but… I can see how maybe I should have mentioned it.

BASIRA
Or that we were being stalked by some freaky spider woman? Don’t tell me you didn’t know about that.

ELIAS
Uh, yes, well, to be honest I – I’d advise you to leave that one well alone.

BASIRA
Oh, yeah?

ELIAS
Look, look – I’ve been doing this a long time now, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned about the Web, it’s that it plays its own game. All you can really do is hope it doesn’t get in the way of whatever your plan is. Because the Spider usually wins.

Assuming you have a plan.

Do you have a plan, Detective?

BASIRA
Why do you do that? What is that?

ELIAS
Do what?

BASIRA
You always call me “Detective.” Is that supposed to mean something?

ELIAS
Honestly, I just like the way it sounds.

BASIRA
[exasperated noise]

So: why did you agree to see me?

ELIAS
I missed you.

BASIRA
Right. That’s why you’ve been refusing my visits since we got back.

ELIAS
I thought it might have… been an idea to give you some space.

BASIRA
Oh? And how’d that work out for you?

ELIAS
Um, not ideally?

BASIRA
So what now? Another wild goose chase? More gloating about John’s “destiny?” Because right now, I’m having a real hard time figuring out why I shouldn’t just tell them to throw your little deal out the window, and see how you do in here without special treatment.

ELIAS
I mean, you have plenty of reasons to do that, of course, but I’m not sure that they have any reason to listen to you.

BASIRA
I’ll make them listen.

ELIAS
Will you? You’re not police anymore. You’ve done them some favors, but they’ve done you some, as well. And I think you’ll find the information that I’ve been giving to them has been far more consistently useful. You want to issue an ultimatum? go right ahead. I’m just not sure it’ll go quite how you hope.

And, um, no more violence, Detective. Or I may have to call in the guards.

BASIRA
So that’s it, then.

ELIAS
As far as I can tell, you have no interest in anything I have to say, and maybe came here to let off some steam – so, yes, that’s probably it.

BASIRA
Surprised you didn’t foresee it.

ELIAS
Well, that’s always been my problem. Ever the optimist.

BASIRA
You know, when you have no more useful information and they’re done with you –

ELIAS
You’ll kill me. Yes. I’m sorry to say it, Detective, but you’re becoming predictable.

BASIRA
[exasperated noise]

ELIAS
Goodbye, Detective. I shall miss our little chats.

[CLICK]

ARCHIVIST
Well?

BASIRA
Just useless gloating. Like I said he would.

ARCHIVIST
You should have let me come with.

BASIRA
No. Besides, he wouldn’t have seen me if I had.

ARCHIVIST
I can’t believe you’ve been seeing him all this time.

BASIRA
Oh, yeah. That’s the terrible secret sabotaging the trust between us.

ARCHIVIST
[huff]

…Did he mention it at all…? My, uh…

BASIRA
Oh, your new diet? Nothing useful. Didn’t seem too fazed by it.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
What.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know – I mean, we still don’t really know what Elias actually is? I thought maybe if he was more like me than we realize…

BASIRA
He might have some advice?

ARCHIVIST
Stupid, I know…

BASIRA
Yeah. John, We’ve been over this. the key is to not force people to feed you their trauma. You know – just don’t do it?

ARCHIVIST
It’s not that simple.

BASIRA
No. It is. Or I put you down.

ARCHIVIST
…

I mean, that’s hardly –

BASIRA
Daisy’s been managing.

ARCHIVIST
Daisy is… yeah. She’s managing.

Did he say anything about Annabelle?

BASIRA
Not really. Sounds like he’s not too worried, though. Says to just ignore it.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, good luck with that.

BASIRA
Any luck finding her?

ARCHIVIST
I haven’t really been trying. Doing that sort of thing consciously… makes me hungry.

BASIRA
Oh, well then: find a statement to your tastes, and read it.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, yes, I know, thank you.

…Basira?

BASIRA
Yeah?

ARCHIVIST
I have been meaning to ask: the tape, the one of the uh… my victim. You said Martin gave it to you.

BASIRA
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
How was he? How did he look – was he – uh –

BASIRA
[interrupting; sounding slightly less harsh] I don’t know. I didn’t see him. He just left it on my desk with a note.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Right.

BASIRA
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Can I ask what it said?

BASIRA
Um, yeah. It said, uh. “Talk to him”

ARCHIVIST
[harsh breathing/sobbing sounds]

I’m gonna get something to eat.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of Sunil Maraj regarding their work as a security guard and the disappearance of their co-worker, Samson Stiller. Original statement given 3rd April, 2011. Audio recording by Jonathan Simms, the Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
So I lost my job last week. I mean, I quit, they didn’t fire me or nothing. But you know how like sometimes you quit because you want to, and sometimes you quit because you’ve got to? Well, this was the second, although I’m not gonna pretend I’m not glad to see the back of the place.

It’s ‘cause I kept asking about Samson, you know? And what I saw. And they really, really don’t want me to make a stink about that. Because if he just disappeared one day, didn’t come into work, that’s fine – I mean, not fine for his family, obviously, or the police who have to find him, but fine for the company. If he disappeared at work, though – if what I think happened is even close to what actually happened – then that’s real bad news for them, and opens them up to all sorts of lawsuits and liability.

I mean, it’s fine, I can get other jobs, and it’s not like I really want to be working there after what happened, but I just wish someone would take it seriously. It’s messed up, and I’m having a real hard time getting out of my head.

So, I work security right? Used to be, a company or shop would have its own little security force they put together, did all the in-store and CCTV vigilance stuff. These days, it’s all centralized, though. You tend to have a building or a shopping central contract all the security work out to a single company, who’ll then cover all the businesses or shops. It’s easier, from a centralizing point of view, and cheaper, if that’s what the owners like.

But it does mean that there tends to be a lot less stability and how it’s all structured, personnel-wise, at least. If you’re lucky, you’ll be assigned to a post and stay there for years, getting to know the place, the systems, your co-workers. If you’re unlucky, or there’s contract difficulties, you could easily end up moving through two or three different places in as many months.

That was kind of the case for me and Samson. We were the odd men out in a lot of ways. We’d originally been brought in for a big corporate office block near Liverpool Street, but there’d been some problem and the whole place had to be closed up for months. Samson said they found asbestos, I heard it was a lease issue, but it doesn’t really matter. Point is, they hired us for a job that no longer existed.

I expected they’d just get rid of us, but I mean to their credit, they did try to do right. They did their best to fit us in with other security teams: I mean, over the last two years we did a couple of data centers, a digital marketing hub – whatever that is – three different office buildings near Kings Cross… trouble was, every time, almost as soon as we got there, there’d be some personnel changes, or expiring contracts, or some other trouble, and generally, as the last in the door, we were the first to get reassigned. Started to feel a bit like we were cursed, you know?

Samson took it harder than I did. I mean, I’m young, my mum’s got a flat in Hackney, and to be honest, most of my evenings are out with friends or in with black ops, so the moving around was pretty much fine with me. Sam had a three-year-old, though, and lived way down in Morden, so being thrown from one post to another all the time was really kind of getting to him. He tried to talk to me about it a few times, but honestly, we weren’t that close. Or rather, we were close because we’d always worked together, but we didn’t have a huge amount in common. I mean, I tried to talk to him about football for a while, but I think he could tell I was talking out of my ass. Anyway, point is, when we were reassigned to a shopping centre in Stratford, he wasn’t in a great place.

Now, I’m not sure I can legally name the shopping center I was working in to you guys, but let’s just say it wasn’t the Westfield. It was old, clearly been around decades, and the security systems really showed it. I mean, one of the shops still had the original alarms from the late 70s, and plenty of them still had cameras that recorded to VHS, for God’s sake.

The security office was a mess. The company I worked for – again, dunno if I can legally say them, but you can look it up, you know – they have a package where they replace all your equipment and systems with the stuff we use. It’s not cheap, but it’s worth it, if only because we all know exactly how to use that stuff.

Whoever was running this shopping center had very much not opted for that particular contract. I mean, the teams before us had made a valiant effort to centralize and integrate all the feeds and setups into just the one control room, but… damn, that place was a mess. Flat screens, next to banks of old CRT monitors that some of the cameras had to feed into, next to racks of channel banks, and a few actual, honest-to-god computers, that tried their best to wrestle everything into something that was almost usable.

I found it properly overwhelming, didn’t like the place at all. But Sam actually seemed to get on with it pretty well almost from the get-go. He’d apparently been an engineer back in the day, and something about all those old surveillance systems, all tied together, all wrapping into and around each other like some weird nest of cameras… it seemed to really appeal to him. The first week he was there he spent almost the entire time playing with the system and the wiring… left me to do most of the other work on my own. Well, I mean… there were the other guys working there, of course, but even the ones who’d been there awhile started to get the picture and gave Samson a bit of a wide berth after a few days.

He really did seem to get the place in a bit better order. I mean, some of it, only he really understood, but soon enough it actually made sense – what we were watching and when – and he managed to get rid of some of the delay, so that we even managed to catch a couple of shoplifters.

There was only one piece of equipment that seemed to give him any trouble. It was this old Tecton multicamera recorder from the late 80s, managed the feeds for one of the various budget shoe shops that lined the promenade.

It didn’t seem all that complicated when you just looked at it, but trying to use it was an absolute nightmare. None the buttons seemed to do exactly what you wanted them to do, and there were all sorts of sequences where pressing a button, holding a button, pressing it three times, all that – they’d all do really different things.

Sam spent almost a whole month wrestling with it, before he finally cracked and he asked Dave – the bearded old guy who we all sort of assumed had been there the longest? – whether they still had any of the old operating manuals.

I remember the smell of dust when Dave went and cracked open the filing cabinet in the back room, before waving his arms in the direction of the drawer and shrugging. I mean, I’d have just left it, obviously, but I think Samson was taking the whole knowing how the system works thing as like – a point of pride? Something he could salvage from the whole situation. Just a way of getting some control over his life, you know?

So he found the manual. More of a pamphlet, really. Can’t have been more than ten pages of A5 in the whole thing, yellowed and water-damaged. Well-used, though. Someone had even put their name in the front, like they were afraid people were gonna steal a manky instruction book.

Still, Sam just couldn’t put it down. I mean, it was like 10 in the morning when we finally found it, and when I went in at 2:00 to see if he’d taken his lunch break yet, he was still sat there, just staring at it. I mean, I’m not a fast reader, or anything but that’s a lot, right?

And like – okay, so this is the part that you’re definitely gonna think I’m having a joke with you, but I’m honestly not, I’m dead serious. Because I saw some of the pages over his shoulder, and on one of them there was, there was a picture of me.

Like, a black-and-white photo of my face. I didn’t get a good look, but it certainly wasn’t one that I remember having taken. Not that would make it any less weird for it to be printed in an old CCTV manual from back when I was doing nappies. And I’m not making it up, I swear.

Then Samson turned, and he looked at me, and I don’t know, I got real spooked. His eyes were all – messed up. Like, weird. And glassy. It was really, really freaky, and I just turned and I got out of there. That wasn’t the end of it, though. If it had been then sure, maybe I write it off as a weird dream, where I was tired or whatever, but no. Because from that point, on Samson just gets creepier.

For a start, he’s always at work. I mean, we’re not always on the same shift, so it takes me a while to notice, but when I ask him about it, he just says that our schedules must have synced up weird. But whenever I arrived, there he was, staring at the monitors, watching all the people come and go, his eyes wide like he was drinking it all in. And whenever I was there late, and it was my turn to close up, he’d always say that he was happy to do it, say I could head off a few minutes early.

So, I never actually saw him leave. I tried to stay once, said I needed to do it myself, but he just got real quiet, like… real quiet, and stared at me.

The bank of monitors was behind him, and I’m just trying to come up with something to say, get him to talk to me… and one by one, they began to just wink off, turning dark.

And I got this feeling, deep in my gut, that if that last monitor turned off, then something really bad was gonna happen to me. It was one of the old CRT sets, big, and bulky, and the picture on it was never that clear, but for a moment it looked like it was me on there. Staring right back at myself as the screens slowly went black, getting closer and closer. The face on the monitor looked absolutely terrified, and I was starting to feel it myself.

So I just tried to smile, told him not to worry about it, and I headed out as quick as I could. My legs were shaking so hard I almost fell on the way out.

Then there were the actual cameras. I mean, you work in a shopping center, obviously you do a bunch of shopping there. I used to get my lunch, for one, and usually pick up any of the essentials I needed. Sometimes, if I was feeling hard done by and it was payday, I might buy myself a new shirt, or a game, or something.

And obviously, because I work security, I know where all the cameras are. where they cover, even how they move. A lot of them are completely static, just pointing at one place. But gradually, I start to notice something when I’m shopping. It’s like a tickling, creeping sensation all over the back of my neck. Like I’m being watched.

So I start to keep an eye on the cameras when I’m in the shops, and you know what, I’m right. They’re following me. Whenever I look at them – doesn’t matter where it was they were meant to be aimed – they’re always focused right on me.

I keep staring at them, moving around, and they just shift to keep the lens pointed at me. But they’re not articulated, they don’t have any motor or swivel mount they just… move. Pointed right at me.

One time, when no one in the store was looking, I threw a can of deodorant at one of them. Hit it square on. Samson wore sunglasses for the next two days, and when I caught a glimpse of him without them, there was a crack right down the center of his eye.

I tried to talk to the others. I’m pretty sure that they were getting similar weirdness from them. they were all jumpy and nervous those last few months. But I was known as Sam’s friend. We’d come in together and everyone just assumed we were close. When I started to ask about it, about what was going on, they just clammed up like I was trying to get them in trouble. My nerves were all shot to hell.

I wasn’t in work the week he disappeared. I’d called in with a bullshit stomach thing. I just needed a break, some time to get my head right. It was almost working, you know? A little distance, a little space to relax. I was starting to feel good.

Then I got the call from Dave. He was frantic.

I couldn’t make out half of what he was saying over the bad line, but he kept saying Samson’s name. Asking me if I “knew,” if he’d “told me.”

I had no idea what he was talking about, but he kept screaming at me. He kept saying, I must know, he must have told me what was going on. He kept saying, “what do we do with his eyes?”

I mean, I didn’t know what the hell to say, I just went quiet listening to Dave as he started sobbing down the phone

“He won’t stop,” he said. “We can’t get rid of his face.”

I hung up. And Dave was gone when I went back in. A bunch of them were, all quit suddenly. I wanted to check in with them, find out what happened, but we’d never really been friends, and I didn’t know any of their details.

I never saw Samson again, either. Though, I did find his old work shirt in the back. It was torn to shreds, wrapped around that old instruction manual. I put it back in the filing cabinet, and I threw the shirt away.

I tried to stick around, to do my job, but I was asking too many questions for the folks upstairs, I think. I wanted to know why Samson hadn’t signed out of the building before he disappeared. Why, no matter who tried to reset the system, it always logged back in as him.

Why, whenever I was watching the monitors alone, I’d see him on that old CRT screen. Staring right back at me. Quietly calling for me to join him.

Statement ends.

[exhale] Hm. Better.

Does reading a statement of the Ceaseless Watcher count as a sort of auto-cannibalism, I wonder? Or some sort of bird-like regurgitation of fear? Re-consuming secondhand terror.

Whatever the analogy, I’m finding it harder and harder to ignore the diminishing returns – how much less satisfaction each one gives me. My desire for follow-up, for verification, for… [frustrated laugh/sputter] proper digestion – the experience, it grows less and less.

I honestly don’t care if Mr. Maraj was chased down and consumed by his voyeuristic former friend, or if he has forgotten the whole affair, living in blissful ignorance.

I just find my mind already wandering to the next statement, in the hopes that it won’t be quite as stale.

Martin Blackwood, assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute. Recording statement number 0131305. Statement of Judith O’Neill, given May 13th, 2013.

Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
It’s weird the things that land you a job sometimes. I mean, a First from Corpus Christi Cambridge, a Master’s in biological sciences, you’d think that would be enough to get a decent science job. But as it turns out, the competition these days is legitimately ridiculous and trying to get a position based on my academic record seemed to be a complete waste of time.

Then I applied to the Anglo-Brazilian Amazon Trust, and you know what actually got me the job? I had a half blue in modern pentathlon

and another in orienteering from my undergrad days. Apparently most of the science positions were generally applied to you by the sort of people who pursued academia specifically to avoid ever having to climb up a hill,

and the job required a certain degree of outdoorsmanship. It didn’t even matter that I didn’t speak Portuguese. Well, not, back then. It was enough that I had the knowledge, fitness, and most importantly, was willing to basically chuck in my entire life in England with no notice to fly off to Brazil for who knows how long. Strange how things work out sometimes, isn’t it?

The job title was technically ‘ecological specimen technician’, but working with the ABAT was basically nothing like any lab tech job I’ve ever had before. For a start, there wasn’t a lab, not really. They built this facility just on the edge of the Caracara ecological station, and from a distance you’d think it was just this big wooden hut, and it kind of was, just full of incredibly high-tech kit. There was basically no testing done on-site though. Aside from the computers, the visiting researchers used to just make whatever notes or observations or run whatever on the models they needed. Basically everything on-site was designed for quick storage and processing any specimens for travel.

Keeping a lab environment up and running in the middle of the Amazon was never really an option, so most of our job was focused on retrieving whatever they wanted testing, and – and making sure that it got to the actual lab intact,

wherever that might have been. I was part of the facility’s permanent staff, and we were generally hired out by corporations or universities who wanted to use our services for some project or piece of research they were conducting. My specific job was to head out into the jungle, usually babysitting some weedy wannabe explorers who insisted on coming along, and then snag whatever they needed to retrieve. Could be environmental measurements, tree cuttings, water samples, and even small animals, though we’re not legally allowed to take anything bigger than a frog. It’s actually really interesting work, although you do start to get a little bored of the same 50 square miles of jungle after you’ve been doing it for a few years. And we’re very careful to stick to the bits of the jungle we’ve been assigned, as we’re right next to the Yanomami indigenous territory, and accidentally crossing into it ends up being a bit… politically complicated, and even pretty dangerous if you cross paths with the wrong group. The Yanomami can get pretty territorial. I mean, I guess you would be too if you had that many companies trying to illegally strip mine your land? Still, it’s not usually a problem. We stay in our area, they stay in theirs.

The worst part is the number of dickhead scientists. You turn up with the same played out Cannibal Holocaust jokes. It’s like, sure, technically they practice endocannibalism, but it’s just the bone ash of their relatives and loved ones, so you know, calm down, Dr. Livingstone. There’s no way they’d respect your sweaty-ass long enough to even consider eating you. Anyway, I’m getting off-topic.

I usually head out with the other specimen tech, Fernanda Mikado, a local.

And by local, I mean she’s from Minau, about 200 miles away. Brazil’s pretty big, and if there’s one thing she’s really good on that I’m not, it’s the weather.

I’m pretty hopeless at figuring out what any given day’s going to be like, and just have to rely on whatever weather sign I’m currently losing faith in. It doesn’t help that the weather in the Amazon is just plain weird, with rains coming out of nowhere, months before the wind should actually be bringing in the clouds, and no one knows why. But Fernanda, she might not know why, but somehow she always knew when, to the point where if she said it might be bad I would just cancel the expedition. No further evidence needed. Not that day though. No, that day we had the world’s fussiest climate scientist breathing down our necks, Doctor Nikos Anastos.

I mean, I read his studies and he did good work, sure, but the way he acted you’d have thought that the oceans were gonna drown us all tomorrow if we didn’t get out there. And how he talked was like, I mean – Fernanda and I were no strangers to patronizing scientists explaining our jobs back to us, but Dr. Anastos was on a whole other level. He talked to us like we were five-year-olds who just asked him what recycling was. Fernanda was certain it was going to rain, but he “checked online” and apparently it said it was going to be fine. Besides, he had some real big money backing him, so we couldn’t really push the issue. In the end, we went out into the jungle, and even I could tell that the color of the sky through the canopy was bad news.

Dr. Anastos was looking to measure pollutant and plastic levels in some of the nearby rivers. The various ecological protection laws should mean that they had virtually none of either, and he was looking into something to do with pollutant transmission and chemical spread from industrial sites. If it hadn’t been for the standard NDAs they were always getting us to sign, I could have already told him the sort of results he was going to get; he wasn’t the first to come here for this kind of work, but my hands were tied. If you’re wondering, by the way, the answer is pretty damn polluted, largely due to various illegal mining and logging operations and a land seizure in the area.

The point is, we were barely an hour into the track when the skies opened. The rain came down thick – thick in that way that I’ve only ever found in the jungle, where there weren’t really droplets, it’s – it’s more like the air just turns to water. Visibility went down to nothing immediately, and I started to talk quickly to Fernanda about whether we could make it back, or where we might be able to shelter. The rain was bad, but we’d handled worse and we were perfectly calm.

Not so much Doctor Anastos, who was clearly panicking. He shouted at us, yelling over the sounds of the rain-soaked jungle that we had to go back, before immediately charging off in the wrong direction. (sigh) Obviously we wanted to leave him to his own stupidity and let the Amazon deal with him, but we both knew that it just wouldn’t be worth the paperwork. So we followed him, trying to slow his pace long enough to let him know that he was going the wrong way. But either he couldn’t hear us, or, more likely, he wasn’t inclined to listen.

Finally, I grabbed his arm, pulling him to a stop. He said something I couldn’t make out and pulled back, trying to throw off my grip, but clearly he hadn’t considered I’d be the stronger and when my grip held firm he unbalanced himself. He shifted his leg, trying to keep his footing, but slipped on the now muddy-ground, falling and pulling me with him. I instinctively grabbed Fernanda for support but ended up pulling her down as well, the three of us tumbling down a short and muddy decline and landing hard in the foliage.

It took a few moments to pull ourselves together. It wasn’t a huge fall, but I felt strangely disorientated as I clambered to my feet, shaking my head in an attempt to dispel some of the fuzziness that had settled over it. The others clearly felt it too, although checking ourselves over, it seemed we’d been lucky. All we had broken was our equipment, although Doctor Anastos had whined about that almost as much as if it had been a bone.

I tried to get my bearings, but even though we’d only moved a few meters laterally at most, I was finding it really hard to get a solid idea on where we were. I couldn’t figure out exactly which way we had come, and I couldn’t get a clear read on the sun through the canopy and clouds. Fernanda wasn’t having any better luck with the compasses, as they were either broken or something magnetic in the area was messing with them. They just gently spun around and around. There was at least something resembling a trail, though not one I recognized. Honestly, we should have just waited it out until we were overdue at the facility and they sent out a retrieval team, but that would take almost a full day and I could see in Doctor Anastos’ eyes that there was no way he was going to wait that long. So, we picked a direction and started walking the trail.

When I first saw the structures, my instinct was to turn around and go back. From a distance, they – they looked like shabono, the huge ring of thatch rues the Yanomami place around their settlements for shelter. It didn’t make sense though. There was no way we’d gone so wildly off course as to end up in the indigenous territory, absolutely no way. It was something else, something about their construction that seemed off, wrong somehow, so much so that when Fernanda grabbed my arm and urgently whispered that we had to leave, I shrugged her off and headed forward for a better look. That was when I noticed how quiet it was. Aside from the rain the jungle cacophony had simply stopped.

As I got closer to the shabono, it became clear what was wrong with it. Though each roof was thatched like normal, the stands weren’t made of leaves, but all kinds of different materials instead. Long strands of plastic, shards of rusted metal, even oddly shaped-hunks of cement. They wrapped through and around each other like any thatch, but the texture, the color – everything about it was different in a way that made my stomach churn, though I wasn’t exactly sure why none of the materials were organic or natural.

I shared a look with Fernanda. She didn’t say anything but she didn’t have to. We both knew how isolationist the Yanomami tended to be, how resistant they were to any outside influences. The idea that they would have the desire to build, or even the equipment to build something like this, was ridiculous. So what did that leave? Had one of the illegal mining operations done it just to antagonize them? Possible, I guess, but it would have taken a lot of work for basically no reason. It just didn’t make sense.

Dr. Anasta didn’t know enough about the Yanomami or their buildings to be unsettled, and instead voiced his irritation that we were standing around chatting rather than going for help. He walked around to one of the gaps in the shabono and headed inside. By the time either of us noticed he was already gone. Fernanda and I scrambled after him, desperately hoping that we were good enough communicators to be able to convey apologies to whoever was in there. But the inside was just like the outside, and in the worst possible way.

There were no people in there, but that’s not the same thing as it being empty. Instead there were… figures. From a distance, they looked like human beings, standing impossibly still, but getting closer quickly revealed the lie. It was just the rough shapes, cobbled together out of a hundred different pieces of garbage: a broken metal clotheshorse for a rib cage, a plastic chair leg for an arm, rusted screws for teeth. In some cases, it looked like someone had gone to a lot of effort to match anatomy with construction. I saw one with a broken water cooler where its stomach would be in. Another had a pair of oxygen tanks standing in for lungs. They were completely still, but there was something about them that made my mouth dry up and my mind scream to run. It didn’t feel like they were statues. It felt like they were choosing not to move.

Doctor Anastos didn’t seem to have the same unease with the situation as me and Fernanda, as he examined and prodded the figures with apparent delight. Maybe he thought avant-garde jungle art was just something that happened out there, I don’t know. I never got a chance to ask him, because suddenly he was cooing with delight at something he’d picked up off the ground. The ground I could now see was simply a half-inch of loose dirt over the top of a massive plastic tarpaulin. He came over to show us his discovery. It was a chunk of concrete that appeared to be the exact size and shape of a tiny pit viper, even down to the detail on its head. The doctor seemed quite taken with it, but Fernanda immediately sensed something was wrong and stepped back, pulling me with her.

What happened then was almost too quick for me to properly follow. The lifeless concrete viper spun around, opened its mouth, and bit Doctor Anastos on the wrist. He screamed, but only for a second, because after that his throat was full. He started convulsing as gray liquid concrete began to pour from his mouth, from his nose, and his eyes. His limbs went rigid and I could see his body starting to swell with it. I don’t know if it was me or Fernanda screaming. Maybe it was both of us. But I know it was her who first spotted that the detritus figures were no longer choosing to stand still.

It was the last I ever saw of Doctor Nikos Anastos. There was never any question of trying to save him. I don’t know how long we ran but it was hours before we felt even remotely safe. The jungle looked normal again, and more importantly, it sounded normal. We tried to talk about what we’d seen, but… after confirming we’d both witnessed the same thing, we realized we didn’t actually have anything to say about it. Just this white-hot fear that still hasn’t completely gone away.

In the end we crossed paths with a group of real Yanomami tribesmen. They were really friendly, and once they figured out we were lost they were very happy to return us to a part of the jungle we knew near our facility. Of course, we didn’t have a good explanation for what happened to Doctor Anastos, so we lost our jobs pretty much immediately, but you know what? That’s fine. I’m done with the jungle. There’s something in there and I don’t know which scares me more. The thought that it’s more than just the things we left behind? Or that that’s all it is, and we can’t escape the ruins of our own future.

MARTIN
Statement ends.

There’s, erm, a note here as well. Looks like Gertrude’s handwriting? Start of a letter to Dekker, thanking him for sending Judith through, although it doesn’t look like it was ever finished or sent. I assume this is another one he was trying to use to prove the Extinction? It certainly has something in it, mankind’s trash giving rise to something terrible. Then again, fear of the other. inanimate humanoid figures, that’s all very Stranger isn’t it?

(sigh) It’s never simple, is it? Sort of surprised Peter hasn’t rocked up with some more insights. Haven’t seen him around for a while, actually. I mean, (heh) it’s not like I miss him, but at least he was someone to – (realization) Ah. Yeah, that makes sense. Right, fine. Just me on my lonesome for a while, then.

Could be worse. peaceful at least. I don’t miss all the shouting, even if it would – wait.

Excuse me – excuse me, this area is off-limits to the public.

GEORGIE
Sorry?

MARTIN
You can’t be here. It’s not allowed.

GEORGIE
Oh, sorry, um, Melanie told me to wait for her here.

MARTIN
Oh, you – you’re here for Melanie?

GEORGIE
Yeah. (introducing herself) Georgie.

MARTIN
I’m sorry – sorry, I didn’t realize. I’m – I’m sure she’s around here somewhere.

GEORGIE
You must be Martin.

MARTIN
Yeah. Has Melanie been talking about me?

GEORGIE
Oh, um… John used to go on about you a lot.

MARTIN
Oh. Oh, wait – wait, I thought Melanie-Georgie and John-Georgie were…

GEORGIE
Same – same Georgie.

MARTIN
Oh. Ah, so you and John….

GEORGIE
Aren’t really talking anymore.

MARTIN
Right.

Why not?

GEORGIE
Excuse me?

MARTIN
Why aren’t you talking?

GEORGIE
Because I think he’s going to destroy himself, and anyone who lets him get too close. And I don’t want that to include me or Melanie.

MARTIN
Maybe he just needs some help.

GEORGIE
I did help him, as much as I safely could, but he just carried on anyway.

MARTIN
(overlapping) Yeah, he’ll do that.

GEORGIE
I realized if I kept trying it was gonna hurt me more than I was willing to accept.

MARTIN
Well, sometimes the helping people hurts.

GEORGIE
Sure, but that doesn’t mean everything painful helps.

Sometimes people have problems that will wreck you long before you can make a dent in them,and some people don’t want help, they just want other people suffering with them.

MARTIN
John doesn’t want that.

GEORGIE
He doesn’t know what he wants. And from the sound of things he’s run out of time to figure it out.

MARTIN
It’s easy to pass judgment from the outside.

GEORGIE
One more reason to stay on the outside and watch.

MARTIN
(wry laughter) And- and you think Melanie’s worth saving?

GEORGIE
It’s not about worth. But yeah, she’s actually trying to get well, so I’m gonna help her.

MARTIN
This place isn’t a sickness –

GEORGIE
No. I think it’s worse.

MARTIN
Look, we’re all just trying to do the right thing.

GEORGIE
Maybe. Look, life forces you to make hard decisions, but I can never trust someone who goes around looking for hard decisions to make.

MARTIN
And what do you mean by that?

GEORGIE
Jumping on a grenade is only heroic if you weren’t the one who actually threw it.

MARTIN
That’s not what’s happening.

GEORGIE
Okay. It’s still not something I want any part of.

MARTIN
Well, lucky for you we’re fully staffed, so…

[FAINT STATIC BUZZES IN THE BACKGROUND]
MELANIE
Hey, you ready?

GEORGIE
Oh, what? Yeah, whenever you are.

MELANIE
Who were you talking to?

GEORGIE
Oh, it was, um – (pauses)

No one, apparently.

MELANIE
(sigh) Yeah, this place will do that to you. Come on.

GEORGIE
Sure.

Statement of Herman Gorgoli, regarding his period trapped alone in a suburban area of Cheadle. Original statement written 9th November, 2014.

Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Life is hard. I don’t wanna bum you out or anything but yeah. You’re all alone trying to connect with people, trying to find your place in the world, but in the end the only person you really know is yourself. And even then, not all that well. There’s plenty of things I’ve done I couldn’t explain to you. I mean, I’m constantly looking back at my past self and thinking, what an idiot. How the hell could he have done such an obviously stupid thing? How was I surprised it went so badly? What a relief I’m now so much older and wiser.

Except that last part never really turns out to be true, does it? The line of when you were your dumb, younger self seems to keep moving forward with you, until each more mature and reasonable version of you eventually falls foul of it and becomes a young idiot. And when you add in another person you reach a whole other level. You can love them, marry them, dedicate your life to them, that’s not the same as actually understanding them.

I was with Alberto for 15 years, and I tell you what, I could always anticipate him. He always used to get annoyed at how predictable I found his mood sometimes, but damned if I ever really knew why. Of course, it doesn’t help that when you’re that close to someone, everything starts to reflect on each other. One bad mood feeds into another and stress just bounces back and forth between you. You can get real bad if you’re not careful, and we weren’t careful. The thing is, when we both found ourselves in positions to be working from home, we actually thought it was going to be really good for our relationship. The two of us spending all our time together, we reckoned it was going to be real romantic.

We were real stupid back then, and when Alberto’s parents offer to sell us their second home in Cheadle, we thought it was a great investment. Nice and quiet, good neighborhood, just a real nice home for the two of us, and so much bigger than anything we could afford in the city. And – before you think Cheadle, the suburb of Manchester, that’s not the one I’m talking about. I’m talking about Cheadle, the suburb of Stoke-on-Trent. Hell, technically it’s not even a suburb, it’s just a village that looks so much like a suburb that you could pull it up and drop it on the edge of any dull town in England, and it would look the same. Just street after street of identical, blandly pleasant houses, all winding around each other in dead ends and cul-de-sacs and one-way systems, making sure every house has plenty of inoffensive garden. I’ve never seen people happily living in a place so obviously dead.

Two years we lived there. Two years imprisoned in that beige, comfortable house with the man I loved, watching our relationship turn to sniping and snapping and bitter passive aggression. I’d say that cheating on him was a foolish act of past me, but honestly it’s one of the few decisions I’ve ever made that I completely understand. I didn’t even try to hide it, not really.

When he found out and it all ended, I kind of hated myself for just how relieved I was that I’d finally be able to leave that place. To get in my car and drive away from that gentle suburban nightmare. I mean, I’d lived there for two years and I still got lost trying to leave. I thought that was the worst that place would ever make me feel. I wish I’d been right.

I got a cheap apartment in Liverpool and tried to tell myself I was happier

the single life, footloose and sitting at home, binging bad TV. I tried to get back into the club scene, but honestly I think I’m just too old now. The music was too loud, the drinks were too expensive, and the sort of thing I used to take to, dancing all night now, hit me with a down so hard that I had to write off almost the entire week. It didn’t help that over the course of a ten-year relationship, my friends had become our friends, and there weren’t any of them siding with me in this situation. Some would drop platitudes about maybe reconnecting after the fallout was done with, but I know when I’m being handled by people who don’t want to create any more drama. It was miserable, but every time I thought about going back, I felt nauseous the idea of returning to those eggshell walls that we never got around to repainting, and the living room that expected me to sit there and watch Midsomer Murders until I passed away peacefully in my sleep. It made me want to throw up.

I’d probably have stayed away forever if it hadn’t been for the moose. There was a carved wooden moose you see, something Alberto’s grandfather had carved, apparently, and a real family heirloom. It was an ugly old thing, with this weird angular face that always made my skin crawl a bit. I’d never let him display it in our house, so it had lived in one of the suitcases under the stairs. The suitcases I pulled out and filled in a tearful rage when I was leaving, so… yeah, I’d kind of accidentally stolen the moose. When he finally realized and texted me, demanding it back, I should probably just have sent it by post.

But no, for some reason I decided I was going to drive all the way down there and give it back in person. Maybe I was hoping for a fight, or just to see him again, I don’t know. I was younger then. Foolish.

It was late when I got to what I thought was his street, driving through the one-way signs and well-maintained gardens that bordered that snaking road. The sun had disappeared but the sky was still fairly light. That late summer twilight that seems to just drag on forever. There weren’t any other cars on the road and I was already getting frustrated. My sat-nav had decided to start sending me around in a circle and I was apparently no closer to finding our… Alberto’s house. The roads weren’t like I remembered them, or rather – they were exactly like I remembered them. Bland, interchangeable, and impossible to navigate.

I must have driven around for almost a half hour before I finally decided that if the internet and GPS couldn’t help me, I’d have a proper look at the actual paper map that I kept in the boot. I spent a few minutes scanning the Cheadle area until I found the road I was looking for – Ash Tree Hill. Then I drove on it, I found a street sign at the next turning, hoping to compare it to what was on the map. And then I stopped, because the sign said, “Road”. No name, just Road. It wasn’t as though the actual name of the street had been defaced or removed, the sign was complete. It just didn’t say anything else.

So I drove on until I found the next one. Street. I tried to compare it to the map. Maybe this place just had some really bland road names and somehow I’d never noticed in the two years I’d lived there, but no. The places on the map will have the names I remembered. Chapel Street, Meadow Drive, Station Road. Bland, sure, generic, but not literally placeholder.

I pressed on, looking for more. Avenue. Close. Way. Lane. Only ever the suffix, never with a name attached. By this point I was starting to feel a little bit freaked out and I decided to just get out of there. I could come back later, when my sat-nav was working properly in proper daylight. The sky was getting darker by this point and I had to put my headlights on. I still hadn’t seen any other cars on the road, or as I thought more about it, people on the streets. But as you might imagine, getting out of there proved even more difficult than finding the house I was looking for. Every time I thought I’d found a main road that led out of this weird looping suburbia, a one-way sign seemed to spring up, directing me back into the sprawl. I did U-turn after U-turn as I was channeled into one dead-end cul-de-sac after another, until eventually I decided to simply disregard the one-way signs completely.

I cruised past the one that seems to be blocking my most likely exit and almost breathed a sigh of relief as I found myself leaving the suburban maze I’d been trapped in. Until it led me to an entirely different maze of unremarkable residential neighborhoods. Even then, I still didn’t accept that I was trapped. It – it didn’t make any sense, and it wasn’t like I’d seen anything blatantly supernatural, it wasn’t that there was anything abnormal about the whole situation. It was just that the normal seemed to go on forever.

At some point I got out of the car and started to hammer on random doors. I mean, I tried the doorbells at first, but they were silent, so I started knocking and knocking until my hand hurt. There was no answer at any of them. There were no lights on behind the drawn curtains, and all the house numbers were zero. I got back into my car and started driving again, going on and on until finally I ran out of petrol. It rolled to a sputtering stop at the end of one of the indistinguishable dead ends.

It had been full dark for hours by this point and my dashboard claimed it was 3:00 a.m. My phone had died about an hour ago, and once the last of the power went in the car I was left with no way to tell the time at all. I wished I hadn’t thrown away the wristwatch Alberto had given me, but it was too late for those regrets.

I stepped outside, looking down the street. There were no lights on in any of the houses, but the identical lampposts bathed the place a sickly orange as far as I could see. I decided that the roads must be the problem. They were what was keeping me trapped in this place, constantly turning and bending and confusing me. If I just picked a direction and kept to it, eventually I had to get to the edge of what by now I had decided was a newly built neighborhood that apparently no one had moved into yet. As an explanation it didn’t make any sense, but it didn’t need to, not at that moment.

So I started walking, going around houses and through gardens, trying at all times to keep my direction straight and consistent. I may be too old for clubbing, but I still keep pretty active, so getting over the fences wasn’t much of a problem for me as I passed from identical road to identical garden over and over again. I don’t know how long I went on like this but it felt like hours. At the start, I was counting how many houses I passed but when I got to a hundred I stopped. It was beginning to eat away at my careful rationalizations and I couldn’t have that.

Eventually, my legs started to go and I decided I needed some rest. I was about to sit on the street when a thought occurred. I marched up to a nearby front door, prepared to kick in the flimsy-looking wood, but trying the handle revealed it was unlocked. I don’t know why I picked that house.

It was exactly identical to all the others. I’ve often wondered if there was anything that drew me to it… perhaps I was just unlucky. Or perhaps there only ever was one house.

The lights worked, which was a relief, and the inside looked exactly how I expected it to. And I mean exactly how I expected it to. From the blank IKEA furniture to the subtly patterned cream wallpaper; to the picture frames lining the wall, containing what were clearly stock photos, each of a different family pantomiming a scene of domestic bliss. I headed into the living room and sat down on one of the almost-comfortable armchairs. My body was aching, and my eyes were heavy, and I had the thought that maybe I should head up to the bedroom. In the back of my mind though I knew that was a trap. I had somehow become convinced that if I went to sleep here, then I would never leave.

My hand drifted down and brushed the plastic remote control. Almost on instinct, I picked it up and turned the TV on. A cooking show. A woman I almost recognized fussing over a turkey. She was talking, or at least it sounded like she was, the cadence and the sounds were so much like English that it took me almost a full minute to realize that she wasn’t actually saying words.

She never looked at the camera. There seemed to be something wrong with her eyes, though I couldn’t say what. Her hands moved over the pale skin of the turkey, poking it and prodding it as though preparing it, though she wasn’t actually doing anything to it. Eventually she gripped a part of it between finger and thumb, and tore off a long strip of dry looking meat, before tossing it over her shoulder and returning to her strange mimicry of cooking.

I pressed the remote again, a shopping channel. The host was a tall, clean-shaven man with close-cropped hair. He was holding a brick and talking about it in that same flow of non-words that still had a familiar salesman’s patter. The screen scrolled the message, BUY NOW! But there was neither price nor compact details, as this man who wouldn’t look at the camera earnestly pretended to sell me a brick. It was almost hypnotic.

I leaned back in the chair trying to think clearly about what was happening

my eyes found themselves focusing on the ceiling, on a small spot of red that seemed to have seeped through from above. As I climbed those stairs I desperately tried to tell myself I didn’t know what was going to be up there.

And to be fair I was surprised by some of the details. But as soon as I saw the spot, I just knew that someone else was up there and that they were dead.

The only questions were how and who. I think I’d given up on why.

I didn’t know them, as it turned out. A young woman, conservatively dressed. Her face was bloody but I was sure I didn’t recognize her. She had a bag with her, and her ID read “Yotunde Uthman”, not a name I’d ever encountered before. Just another victim of this place. It looked as though she had forced her head through the mirror on the dressing-table. The shards cutting her face and neck to ribbons, a particularly large piece piercing her jugular, spilling blood all down the unremarkable white table and onto the light brown carpet below. I don’t think she’d been dead that long. I’m not a doctor and I didn’t really try to check.

Instead I turned and ran, all my tiredness gone in a sudden rush of adrenaline, down the stairs out the door and into the night and the rows upon rows of bland empty houses. And then all at once I wasn’t running anymore. I was lying on the ground, collapsed, the tarmac rough and cool against my cheek wet from my tears.

I was going to die. I knew that now, just as she had, just as anyone else who came here had. How many corpses lay waiting behind the placid facade of this endless false suburbia?

And that was when I heard it. It was quiet. My mind took a few moments to accept it could be real, but sure enough there it was – the sound of my phone’s ringtone. I looked up, and not three doors down was my car, the door still open where I had left it. I stumbled over my legs, still weak, and grabbed the handset which should have been long out of battery, and I stared at the glowing screen. It was Alberto. He was calling me.

I don’t know how, but the tears came even faster now as I answered, sobbing with relief to hear him yelling at me for taking so long. Had I forgotten? Was I even planning to bother? I tried to reply to explain but all I could manage to say to get through the shaking sobs was, “I love you.”

He went very quiet and then he hung up.

It didn’t matter though because when I looked around. The windows of the houses were lit and a woman was coming down from her front door to ask if I needed help with my car. We’re working on it, the two of us. We’re not exactly back together yet, but I think it’s going well. He’s reluctant to sell the house but I’ve made it quite clear that I’m never going back to the suburbs, even if I can’t really tell him why.

I checked to see if I could find anything about Yotunde Uthman, and I did find a few old social media profiles, but I wasn’t able to get through to any family or friends. As far as I can tell she disappeared a year ago and nobody noticed.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

The Lonely is possibly the most insidious of the powers, I believe. Certainly it is the one that most delights and having you do its work for it, even the spiders seem to have a hard time matching it for sheer seductiveness. (hmph) Time to yourself. Self-care. Putting yourself first. Not being a burden on those you care about. Doesn’t even need to tell you any lies – just waits for the lies you tell yourself.

We’re all well aware that with Peter Lukas in charge of the Institute, it’s a very real danger to all of us. We are trying. Daisy, Basira and I, we don’t leave the Institute much anymore, so we do spend a lot of time together. It’s not that easy though. When everyone has so many walls, so many defenses, sometimes you can feel lonely even when you’re all in the same room. But it’s better than the alternative and at least none of us are suffering alone. Martin’s got it the worst of course, but it still seems to be his choice, and I have to trust that he knows what he’s doing.

Still feeling weak. Restless. I want to be proactive but there hasn’t – (sigh) That hasn’t been going quite so well for us lately.

Oh, uh – come in, Melanie.

[DOOR OPENS]
MELANIE
John, have you got a moment?

ARCHIVIST
Of course. I was just having a statement and –

MELANIE
Oh. An old one?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, an old one. I’m not – I’m doing my best.

MELANIE
Sure.

ARCHIVIST
What do you want?

MELANIE
Er, I just wanted to talk to you about… well, um… my career, I guess. My position in the archives.

ARCHIVIST
I see.

MELANIE
Look. (pause) I’m not going to do my job anymore.

ARCHIVIST
I am not sure I follow you. We can’t quit, we’ve all tried.

MELANIE
I didn’t say I was going to quit, I said I’m not going to do my job.

No researching, no filing, no field trips, nothing that is going to help the Institute in any way. I’ll still be around, I just… I can’t be a part of this anymore. If – if I get sick, I get sick, and – and if I die –

ARCHIVIST
Why?

MELANIE
Because this place is evil, John. And so doing this job – helping it out, even in small ways – is in some way evil too. Every time we try to use it to do good, it just seems to make everything worse, and – and I will not be a part of that anymore.

ARCHIVIST
What about the Unknowing? We saved the world.

MELANIE
Did we? I mean, I-I think it was the right thing to do, but how many people were killed to do it? We weren’t even a neutral party. We did it as agents of the Eye, because Elias told us to.

ARCHIVIST
And then you put him in jail.

MELANIE
Martin put him there. And he’s still doing harm. You ever think that maybe this whole ritual business is just an excuse, and that we’re all part of some huge, miserable fear machine?

ARCHIVIST
I’ve… considered the possibility.

MELANIE
Right, well. If I’m just another cog, maybe I can’t leave the machine, but from this moment I’m not turning. I’m jammed.

ARCHIVIST
Did your… therapist suggest this?

MELANIE
Not – not exactly. She’s just helped me work through some things I’ve been thinking for a while. Uh, she doesn’t know the details, just that I’m in a bad contract situation working somewhere pretty awful. She thinks I work for the Tories.

ARCHIVIST
God.

Melanie, could you – could you describe your therapist for me?

MELANIE
(laughing) What, you think I wouldn’t notice if she had cobwebs down her face?

ARCHIVIST
…no.

MELANIE
(long sigh) That’s it, isn’t it? Do you really think I’m so stupid I wouldn’t have noticed if my therapist was some kind of monster?

ARCHIVIST
I just – it was a worry.

MELANIE
Right, right. Okay. I know… that is why I ruined my first four sessions and almost torpedoed the chance at a genuinely really good therapist, because I was so paranoid that she was going to turn out to be some – some thing trying to manipulate me. But no, she’s not full of spiders, or made of wax, or wearing the therapist’s skin or whatever, she’s just a well-trained professional who I am paying to help me.

ARCHIVIST
Okay. (sigh) It’s just… the Web can be subtle, you understand?

MELANIE
And? For all you know its plan is to paralyze you with indecision. Leaving you sitting here, terrified that everything you do is somehow all part of its grand plan. And who do you think that fear is gonna feed?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, well. You are not the first to make that point.

MELANIE
Look, I… didn’t come here for a fight. I just wanted to let you know what was going on. If you need me, I’ll be trying to get Daisy drunk.

ARCHIVIST
Good luck. It’s only ever happened once in 2006, she drank – sorry. Didn’t mean to.

MELANIE
Sure. See you around.

Mm-hm! [laugh]

MARTIN
Um, excuse me sir – uh, sorry, you – can’t actually be here?

UNKNOWN
Oh, not to worry! I seem to be doing all right so far.

MARTIN
No, I, I mean – this area is actually off limits to the public, so –

UNKNOWN
And quite right, too! Goodness, the things they could learn here! Turn your hair white, eh? (chuckles) Best to keep them out, I say.

[THE UNKNOWN MAN CONTINUES TURNING PAGES, ‘HMM’ING TO HIMSELF.]
MARTIN
(suspicious) …who are you? Did Peter send you?

UNKNOWN
Ah! You must be Martin. Goodness, he was not exaggerating.

MARTIN
What’s that supposed to mean?

UNKNOWN
Oh, come now, don’t be like that.

Let’s start over. Simon. Simon Fairchild. Peter asked me to look in on you and have a small chat. Well, a big chat, really. Answer all those… nagging questions.

MARTIN
Simon Fairchild.

…(nervous laugh) Wait, Simon Fairchild, as in –

SIMON
As in, all those people who said I did horrible things to them and their loved ones? Yes!

…They have been in, haven’t they? I’d hate to think I’m underrepresented in here – not when Peter tells me that that (derisive) bone fellow has at least half a dozen –

MARTIN
No, no! (nervous laugh) Not, not at all. You, you’ve sent plenty of people our way.

SIMON
Brilliant! So. Shall we get started?

MARTIN
S-sorry, (nervous laugh) I’m still not entirely clear what’s going on. What are you doing here?

SIMON
I see! I suppose it was a bit much to expect him to have filled you in on everything already. I mean – in many ways – that’s the point.

MARTIN
(resigned) …riiight.

SIMON
So. You’ve been working with Peter for a while now, correct?

MARTIN
Sure.

SIMON
And he’s been promising you answers to all those – difficult questions?

MARTIN
I, I mean, sort of.

SIMON
Well, that’s me.

MARTIN
What?

SIMON
Yes, well, you have to understand how it is with Peter. He finds talking to people directly very difficult. Especially explaining the more, um – esoteric side of things? Charming chap, I’m sure you agree – absolutely lovely – but even if you can convince him to actually give you a straight answer, he’s just not that good at actually putting these things into words.

Something to do with his upbringing, I think. (conspiratorial whisper) I’m pretty sure he was home-schooled, you know!

MARTIN
So – so, what, he sends you to answer questions because he doesn’t want to?

SIMON
Precisely!

MARTIN
And you do it? Why?

SIMON
Is that your first question?

MARTIN
(tense) …is there a limit?

SIMON
Only until I get bored. And that does tend to come more quickly these days.

MARTIN
O…okay, okay then, sure, sure. First question, then. Why are you helping Peter? Don’t you serve different, you know, fears?

SIMON
Well, now… See, that’s actually two questions. The answer to the first is simple. I lost a bet, and this is how the good Captain chooses to use that.

The second is… sort of? I mean – yes, if you want to get technical, he serves the One Alone and I serve the Falling Titan, but those two are a lot closer than you might imagine.

After all, the larger the space you find yourself alone in, the more isolated you feel.

MARTIN
And being aware of how lonely you are (dry laugh) can make anywhere feel more empty.

SIMON
Exactly.

I’ve actually been toying with the idea of trying to do something with the scale of humanity itself – you know, emphasize all that overpopulation nonsense – but honestly, it just doesn’t ring true for me. We’re all just so tiny and pointless, you see, it’s hard to really get past it.

Also, I worry it might be straying into territory that emboldens our potential new rival.

MARTIN
The Extinction.

SIMON
The very same. Peter said you’d have a lot of questions about that one.

MARTIN
I do.

How are new powers born?

SIMON
Hmm… Don’t know.

MARTIN
How soon could it attempt this ritual?

SIMON
(cheerily) No clue.

MARTIN
How do we stop it?

SIMON
Can’t help you.

MARTIN
(teeth gritted) Could you at least try?

SIMON
No, no, no, you’re right, of course. The thing you have to remember is that no one actually knows how these things work – not really.

There’s always been plenty of theories, of course, and over a century or two you do start to get an intuitive feel for it, but… there’s really no hard-and-fast rules.

The powers, or entities, or fears, or whatever you want to call them, are bound up in emotion. In feeling. How they exist, what they can do, how they interact with the world… it all makes about as much logical sense as a nightmare.

[MARTIN INHALES]
Which is to say, there is a certain sort of emotional logic to it all: things feel like they flow together in a way that makes sense, but if you try to stop and do the maths, then it all comes apart. At least, in my experience.

When is a new power born? Well, when does it feel like its birth would be right? When enough creatures suffer a terror of it that feels distinct, that feels truly its own? Then it would probably feel right for it to emerge into its own.

Or perhaps there’s a ritual. If it feels right to enact some sort of birthing ceremony, some… apocalyptic midwifery –

MARTIN
(interrupting) And how close is it, do you think?

SIMON
Hard to be sure. Peter thinks very close indeed, what with all the current hubbub, and I’m inclined to agree.

MARTIN
You don’t sound worried.

SIMON
That’s because we disagree on exactly how bad it will be. Peter seems convinced that the Extinction is different, that its actual birth will be as bad – or worse – as another power fully manifesting. He believes its advent will be heralded by all sorts of disasters, and catastrophes, and global upheavals, and whatnot. That kind of thing.

MARTIN
Sounds like a rich feeding ground.

SIMON
Well, exactly! Peter, however, seems to think that it will upset the balance that we all have an awful lot invested in. And he’s not at all certain the world as we understand will come out the other side.

MARTIN
And let me guess: you think he can’t see the big picture.

SIMON
(exhale) I see why he likes you.

[MARTIN SIGHS]
It’s all a matter of perspective, you see. My patron has gifted me with, quite frankly, an absurdly long life. An appropriate gift, and one that serves to provide a certain distance from things. Of course, a paltry few centuries is nothing, really, but it’s more than most get. And even in that brief time, I’ve seen all sorts of ebbs and flows to the balance of things.

Do you know when the last ritual I attempted was?

MARTIN
– I – I don’t know, that space station…?

SIMON
Oh, goodness, no, that’s the future, my boy! No. It was 1853! The height of the aquarium mania! All over the empire, people were starting to understand the depths of the terrible unknown below the ocean. And I thought that was a rich vein to be tapped. Even bothered old Halley1 into helping me design a special diving bell for the ritual. I called it the Awful Deep, and between you and me, I was rather proud of myself.

MARTIN
So why didn’t it work?

SIMON
Because it wasn’t a very good idea…? The fear wasn’t out there – not like I hoped it was. It all sort of… fizzled.

Also, a Hunter broke in and destroyed the mechanism. Sent me and all my sacrifices plummeting to the bottom of the ocean.

MARTIN
I don’t see your point.

SIMON
(inhale) My point is…

…you know, I’ve quite forgotten!

[MARTIN SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION]
SIMON
Hey, I’ve just not been doing much recently. It’s not a good time for perspective, you see. The world all feels too small these days.

I used to do a lot with religion, but it’s just not got the same conceptual scope as it used to. Honestly, I’m pinning most of my long-term hopes on space. But that’s at least a hundred years away.

MARTIN
(tense) Assuming the Extinction doesn’t derail everything…!

SIMON
Which is why I’m happy helping Peter.

But, if it does, then I’ll either be dead, which will be fine, or… I’ll adjust.

MARTIN
It doesn’t scare you…?

SIMON
Martin. Taken on a cosmic scale, we’ve never even been alive – not in any way that might register. I mean, if this dreadful little planet had a fractionally different orbit, and life had never even started here, then ultimately nothing of any real importance would have changed.

MARTIN
…

I think our experience of the universe has value. Even if it disappears forever.

SIMON
What a lonely way to look at things. Which makes sense, I suppose.

MARTIN
So what do you do, then, if – if the world is pointless, and your god is so weak right now?

SIMON
I have a good time. And do my best to avoid the drama.

It’s all been getting a bit much over the last few decades. I blame the number of people. From a raw numbers point of view, it’s getting very busy. More minds equals more fear, after all.

MARTIN
(pouncing) I thought you said that the maths doesn’t work.

SIMON
Oh, you are a quick one!

So, maybe I’m wrong! But, crucially, I suspect a lot of the other servants and creatures out there have a similar idea. Probably why they’re all in such a rush to make their own attempts.

MARTIN
You make it sound like the – the entities don’t even know what they’re doing.

SIMON
I have no idea if they’re “doing” anything at all. If they’re even capable of “doing” things. I know that most of their servants are simply doing their best to interpret and serve something that is almost definitively inconceivable.

MARTIN
You can’t be serious!

SIMON
All right. Let’s try one of those analogies Peter finds so annoying. Erm… imagine you are deaf. But every night you hear the most beautiful music in your dreams, and your every waking thought is consumed by trying to reproduce that music. – oh, you’re mute, as well, in this analogy, or at least, you can’t sing. And you need to invent the idea of a musical instrument from scratch. Everyone else is also deaf and mute, and, um –

MARTIN
(impatient) Yes, yes, I think I get it.

SIMON
Yes, well the point is: most of us are trying so desperately to recreate our own dream symphony that we bring an awful lot of our own baggage into the mix.

MARTIN
…What about the monsters?

SIMON
What monsters?

MARTIN
Things like Mi– erm, uh, the Distortion. I thought they were part of the entities themselves – like, extensions. Surely they know what’s going on.

SIMON
Honestly, I think they have it a lot worse than we do. Imagine being a hand that can conceive of itself – having impulses shot through you, being moved and clinched by some unseen mind – but never knowing the reasoning behind your own actions. Or even if you’re just some thoughtless reflex. (noise of disgust) Sounds horrid.

MARTIN
(agitated) So – so, if no one’s ever actually communicated with their patron, how do you know they even want rituals? How – h-how does anyone know if they could ever even work?

SIMON
We don’t!

[MARTIN SCOFFS]
SIMON
And honestly? The idea that this is all some grand cosmic joke – thousands of us running around spreading horror and sabotaging each other pointlessly, while these impossible, unknowable things just lurk out there, feeding off the misery we cause?

I find that interpretation quite appealing.

But, I still hear the music in my dreams.

[MARTIN MAKES A SOUND OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. SEVERAL MOMENTS OF SILENCE PASS.]
MARTIN
Who are you? No, no – who were you?

SIMON
Originally? No one you would have heard of. No great historical figure or atrocity-monger.

I’ve been Simon Fairchild about, um, eighty or ninety years, maybe? For business purposes, mainly. By which I mean I was bored at not being wealthy, so I made some arrangements and sent Mr. Fairchild on a very long fall. I could go into details, but without a certain amount of knowledge of 1930s tax practices, it wouldn’t mean very much to you.

MARTIN
And – and how did you get started with it all? Did you – did – did you just look up at the sky one day and fall head-over-heels in love?

SIMON
Sort of, actually.

Except it wasn’t the actual sky, it was a painting. I was apprenticed, you see, under Tintoretto. Dreadful man, but a decent artist. He was fascinated, you see, with the human figure. He found most of the rest of the work dreadfully dull, so he’d always delegate a lot of it to us.

He had a particular distaste for painting the sky, and I was always the one he called on to do them. Days, weeks I would spend, focusing so intently on these patches of clear sky or swirling cloud at the top of his latest self-proclaimed masterpiece. And gradually it sort of, um, drew me in, until it seemed to dwarf the rest of the work. Every stroke of the brush felt larger than my entire existence. And when I finally lost my footing, well…

I should, of course, have fallen to the floor of the church, broken my neck. But that blue-painted sky welcomed me with open arms. And I never looked back.

I try to share it with others – not just as sacrifices – but they often find it difficult to keep up with the, um… velocity I tend to live at. They tend to get left behind, and I suppose it doesn’t help that I can’t bring myself to see any of them as anything other than trivial.

MARTIN
Mm.

SIMON
No wonder I’m so sympathetic to the Lonely!

You know, this really is a place for self-discovery, isn’t it? (chuckles) Statement ends, I suppose.

MARTIN
Er – I’m sorry?

SIMON
Oh, nothing, just my own hubris.

I should have known. When I came here, I said to myself, “Simon,” I said, “You’re going to answer this young man’s questions, but you’re not going to give the Watcher a statement. You’re better than that.” But it’s a hard one to resist, isn’t it? You get in the flow of talking about yourself, and it all just… tumbles out!

MARTIN
It does seem like it.

SIMON
(laughs) Well, this has been fun. Now, if we’re about done –

[CHAIR SCRAPES]
MARTIN
We’re not.

Sit back down.

SIMON
Bold! (chuckles)

[CHAIR SCRAPES]
I like it.

MARTIN
You said you were here to answer my questions for Peter, but so far you’ve told me basically nothing of any use.

SIMON
The big answers are rarely helpful.

MARTIN
Then let’s try some smaller ones.

Is Peter attempting a ritual?

SIMON
Not in the sense that you’re used to. Him and his family made their play a few years ago, and they failed. I’m sure he’d like me to explain it, but I think he can do that one himself.

MARTIN
How honest has he been with me?

SIMON
About which part?

MARTIN
Protecting the others.

SIMON
I think he tried. I suspect he may have slightly exaggerated his abilities when you first made the deal, but he certainly expended a reasonable amount of influence and resources to follow through.

MARTIN
But – but that was never the endgame, was it? He just wanted me on his side long enough to rope me into his, his plans for the Extinction.

SIMON
Do you really need me to answer that one?

MARTIN
Fine. So, why me? What’s his plan? Why not get the others involved?

SIMON
He is what he is, Martin. For a creature of the Lonely, the urge is always to isolate, never to communicate or connect.

I suspect that’s why he’s so keen on wagers. It allows him a framework for cooperation that doesn’t risk any sort of intimacy.

As for his plan… I don’t know the details! But I believe there is something in the Institute that he thinks can help his cause.

MARTIN
And he needs me to use it…?

SIMON
Presumably. From what he said, it must be powerfully aligned to the Watcher. If he wishes to use it, it would need someone already touched by the Eye. And if he wants to control that someone –

MARTIN
They need to serve the Lonely.

SIMON
Quite right.

[MARTIN EXHALES]
Anything else?

MARTIN
How do you feel about this?

SIMON
You might need to be a tad more specific.

MARTIN
All of it. Peter’s plan, the Extinction, me…?

SIMON
I think…(inhale) I think Peter is taking a rather large but calculated gamble. Not just on you, but on a lot of things. If it works, he’ll be in a very strong position. And if he fails, it won’t be all that bad.

MARTIN
(tense) You don’t think it’ll be the end of the world?

SIMON
Oh, it very well might be, but… (sigh) life has continued through dozens of apocalypses already. Ice ages, pandemics, calamities, extinctions. The only reason this one feels special is because, well – it’s happening to you. And that’s the sort of solipsism that tends to come with loneliness, in my experience.

So, my feeling is that I’ll help out where I can, but ultimately, if this Armageddon comes off, then – so be it. Either billions suffer and life goes on, or billions suffer and life doesn’t. In the grand scheme of things, it’s all much of a muchness.

MARTIN
…Right.

SIMON
Sorry. Too big-picture? I get that a lot.

MARTIN
No, it’s… (inhale) Thank you. This has… actually been quite helpful.

SIMON
I’d say, “any time,” but honestly, if you see me again… I may just throw you off something for a joke.

How do you feel about – roller coasters?

MARTIN
Um… Neutral.

SIMON
(disappointed) Oh. You’re no fun.

[FOOTSTEPS WALK AWAY]
[MARTIN SIGHS]
BASIRA
Who was that?

MARTIN
Basira, please, I don’t have time –

BASIRA
(interrupting) Oh, no, you don’t.

MARTIN
(warning) Basira, let go.

BASIRA
I don’t think so. Three weeks I’ve been waiting to catch sight of you, and now I find you chatting with Simon Fairchild. No, you’re not pulling your little vanishing act on me.

MARTIN
How did you know about –

BASIRA
Yeah, John’s not the only one who listens to statements.

MARTIN
…

It’s none of your business.

BASIRA
No? Because it seems to me like you’re palling around with two very dangerous people, right around the time you’re cutting all of us out.

[MARTIN INHALES]
That makes me worried. It makes me suspicious.

…

Tell me I’m wrong.

MARTIN
You’re wrong.

BASIRA
So what’s going on, then?

Talk to me.

MARTIN
It’s. Complicated.

BASIRA
What, they’re just here out of the goodness of their hearts? Helping you save the world from Extinction?

MARTIN
You know about that?

BASIRA
Yeah, John found the tapes you made for him –

MARTIN
(frantically) Shh, shh!

BASIRA
Found a stash of them a while ago. I made sure he shared with the club –

MARTIN
(frustrated) Well, there you go, then!

BASIRA
John may be going through a whole “we have to trust Martin” thing, but I’m not. As far as I can see, you’re either compromised, or you’re being played. And I want to know which.

MARTIN
I didn’t know John had listened to them already.

BASIRA
Well, he has. He seems to think you’ll come to him when you need him. I think you’re feeding him what he needs to hear, so he doesn’t bother you.

MARTIN
Look, I don’t have time for this. I don’t like that I have to work with Peter any more than you do, and I didn’t know that Simon was involved until today.

But I would hope that you and John understood the importance of preventing an apocalypse.

BASIRA
…I guess I’m just a bit burned out on the end of the world.

MARTIN
Yeah, well, that’s your problem.

BASIRA
And if you really think this whole Extinction thing is it – why not come to us for help?

MARTIN
I can’t. Peter’s the one with the plan, and… it needs me to be alone.

BASIRA
And you don’t see anything suspicious about that –

MARTIN
(overlapping) Of course I do, but it – might be the only way, and… so far at least he’s been honest with me. Awful, but… honest.

I need to do this.

For everyone.

[LONG PAUSE]
BASIRA
You’re not expecting to come out of this, are you?

MARTIN
I’ll do what I have to. If I’m right, no one else needs to get hurt.

BASIRA
…

(sigh) Okay.

[MARTIN EXHALES]
You want to do whatever grand sacrifice you think is going to save everyone, go ahead. But you’d best be sure you’re not just playing their game.

MARTIN
I know what I’m doing.

BASIRA
We’ll see.

Don’t make me regret this.

MARTIN
Yeah.

Don’t… tell John.

Please.

BASIRA
Fine. I can’t promise you he won’t just Know it, though.

MARTIN
…

How is he?

BASIRA
Hungry.

[MARTIN EXHALES]
But… he’s keeping it together.

MARTIN
(exhales) That’s good.

Can I go now?

BASIRA
Sure.

Statement of Hezekiah Wakely, regarding his career as a gravedigger. Compiled from a series of letters to Nathaniel Beale between 1837 and 1839. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
August, 1837

I’ll thank you again for your endeavors on my behalf, Nathaniel. I’m sure you can always rely on having a true friend in me. I’ve been installed here some weeks now, and I’m finding myself well-contented, my sexton duties keeping my time employed such as I scarce have a chance to allow myself those dark thoughts that so concerned you when last we visited.

It’s a fine little church, and the Reverend is a good sort, though I’ll confess to finding his gospel readings tending towards the dull of a Sunday service. Not his fault, of course. The Lord gave him that voice for a purpose, no doubt – but sometimes that purpose does feel like it might be providing me a few minutes of unearned slumber. Still, his conduct towards me has never been less than compassion itself. Why, he told me not yesterday that he’d never seen the church shine like it had since I’ve taken over its maintenance.

“Shine?” I says. “Sir, that’s a rare compliment when it comes to cleaning sandstone.” And he laughed heartily, though the joke was of no great consequence. So you may rest easy knowing I am happy enough.

My troubled sleep, on the other hand, has not, of yet, resolved itself in any way to my satisfaction. I work myself to exhaustion, cleaning, polishing and looking after the church proper, and I tell you, when I lie abed I can scarce rise again for the weakness I leave myself in. And yet, sleep still eludes me. And when it does not, I wake as though my heart were trying to leap from my chest, and my throat were full of dust and ashes.

You need not despair, Nathaniel, I know the bottle will no longer help, and my other labors keep the nights from bothering me as once they did, but I do find myself longing for a true and proper sleep.

(pause) I tell a lie. There are some nights I find myself easily slipping to dreamless respite, though you’ll think me a morbid soul for it. Those days I spent digging graves in the churchyard – on those nights I sleep, if you’ll forgive the joke, the sleep of the dead.

I’ve never quite known a rest like it. Perhaps it is the harder, more physical aspect of the task, or perhaps the quiet rhythm of it. There’s no echo as there is in the church, just the sound of pick and shovel hitting dirt. And when it’s deep enough, when you stand at the bottom, the noise of the world just… fades away to nothing. It is the sort of quiet that makes you feel as though the commotion and hubbub of life were but a terrible dream, and in sleeping you were waking up to peace.

(heh) You’ll laugh, Nathaniel, but I almost wrote that I hope I have a chance to dig more graves. What a thought. No, I’d not wish that, for to dig graves one must have something to fill them, and the good Lord takes that at His own pace. You may satisfy yourself I am content with the position you have found for me, and spare no concern for my well-being or the receipt of your charity.

Your humble servant,

Hezekiah Wakely

February, 1838

Nathaniel, something has happened to me. And I felt it only right to send a letter and let you know of it, being as your last letter expressed such a kind curiosity towards my sleeplessness, and – what I mentioned to you in my earlier letters.

My nights have indeed been easier of late, something I may partially ascribe to the recent outbreak of fever in the town – taking more of my time for the grim business of grave digging – and the rest to my gradual settling into my position as sexton.

There is such peace in the churchyard, you see: to walk atop the soil knowing that, deep below my feet, those blessed souls wait happy and silent in the cool, damp earth, counting the days until the Resurrection. It gives me such warmth to think of that I have taken to spending much of my unoccupied time wandering the graves, and, where the mood allows me, taking my sleep there.

I hope such talk does not upset you, and you may rest assured I am no suicide. It is simply the serenity of the dead I envy, not their lifelessness. I seek no escape from the hardships of life, for since you gave me this position I can call little of my life any true hardship, and I am as free of suffering as I have ever been.

But I do long for that rest. I tell myself I wake each day renewed, but I am never as truly satisfied as when I’m in my slumber, and insensible to the world. Perhaps that’s what I hoped to find in my drinking, that gentle oblivion, but it seems like a world ago. I know what it truly is now, walking the churchyard – though you may rest assured I shall wait my turn like a dutiful servant until our Lord sees fit to call me.

I do find, however, that when I dig my graves, I have been going deeper. And at times, I worry I might dig so far as I can no longer get out with my meager ladder. Now, those moments – you must not cast judgment on me for this, Nathaniel, for it is simply a passing fancy – but I will often lie myself down on that soft earth, and I will sleep. And I swear to you that the sleep I find there is more blissful than any I have ever found.

It was there, not a week ago, that it happened. I was digging a grave for the squire’s father – a cruel and venal man, who I rather doubt has easy found himself in the kingdom of Heaven, but a pure soul is not what buys you a well-appointed cemetery plot, and he had plenty of money to do exactly that. I saw his body, you know, as it was being prepared, and I tell you truly that for all the wickedness that man had done, his body knew gentle repose. Though not as gentle, perhaps, as it might be with six feet of earth atop it.

So that was my task, and sure enough, I went about it with my usual fervent duty, such that the work of the day was done by the time the sun were at its height. It was cold that day, and bitter windy, and cracking the ground had been as hard as ice. At least until a few feet down. But by the end of it… oh, I tell you there was warmth in that grave. Whether by my own body or the heat of the soil, I couldn’t say, but it was as comfortable as the fireplace of a public house, and the wind could not reach me in the hole that I had made.

So, as is my late habit, I lay down. And I had no sooner done this than a powerful sleep overtook me.

I had a dream, then. I dreamt a rain had come. A terrible bitter rain that chilled my bones and turned the soil around me dark and sodden. The walls grew damp and slippery, their firm shape lost as they began to slip and crumble. And then all at once they collapsed, the grave filling in a moment with a wave of mud and wet dirt. In a single terrible moment of utter terror, it was atop and around me, covering my face and filling my lungs with its awful choking sod.

And the strangest thing was that it was wonderful. I had never felt such safety as within the crushing weight of earth all around me, the pressing embrace of the buried. In that instant I knew what it was to be dead, and I ached with envy for them.

When I awoke I was above ground again, amid the graves. The rain had been no dream, and I was cold and soaked through, wracked with a chill you may well discern from the quality of my hand. It was true, also, that the rain had caused the grave to collapse, though I must have left it shortly before that happened. I was in no state to address the issue, however, and in fact the Reverend had to ask the sexton from St. Mark’s to do so, as I am still laid up in bed with this cough. (heh) Perhaps I shall be joining the churchyard sooner than I dared hope.

Write me back soon, for I have precious little to do in this invalid’s bed, and sleep is far from me once again.

Your humble servant,

Hezekiah

June, 1838

I must first thank you for your visit, Nathaniel, although my recovery were well completed, it is always most heartening to see an old friend. I hope that the business that drew your way so abruptly were well completed, and that I may anticipate your company again after not too long.

I must tell you I’ve been in some distress these last few weeks, due in no small part of the agitation of the Reverend, who has, of late, succumbed to a very specific, though understandable, mania.

The circumstances and causes are easy enough to explain. It was the funeral of young Nellie Cooper that did it, which was a most upsetting affair. I’ll say I have much sympathy with his plight, as I had a chance to view the body myself, and if you’d asked me if I concurred with Doctor Grant’s judgments of death by drowning, I would have agreed without hesitation. She had that peace to her that I’ve spoken of to you before, and I knew how happy she must be to soon be returning to the earth.

But that day, as they carried the slim coffin down towards the hole that I had dug, and so recently enjoyed my own calm repose, there was a commotion among the pallbearers. Little Nellie’s coffin began shaking and rocking back and forth, such as they were unable to keep their footing and dropped it. The crash of the wooden casket hitting the earth is a sound I’ll not forget in a hurry, nor the shriek that came from inside the splintered wood as it burst open.

As you may well have surmised, Nellie was not, after all, dead, and had shaken off the stupor mere minutes before she was due to be placed below ground. She’s unharmed, at least in body, though I can scarce imagine the maddening strain must have put on her to see her own tombstone carved and waiting above the dark silence of her open grave.

To be honest, I suspect the worst effect is upon the Reverend. To be so near responsible for burying a person alive has shaken him deep, and he stopped all funeral services for a time.

To my mind there are far worse fates. But he has in his head an idea to begin fitting the graves I dig with these new “safety bells” that he has heard of, so that any as might be alive below ground might signal us above for rescue.

I dread the idea. If it had been me in that coffin, destined for the peace below ground, I can think of little that I would hate more than the jarring, clanging of a bell pulling me from my rest.

My dreams have been strange, of late.

Yours,

Hezekiah

December, 1838

I’ve been thinking, Nathaniel, of funerals and bodies. Souls that escape leaving this common clay to become one again with a truer clay. Were we not created from mud? And it seems more fitting to me that we should return forever to that mud, not pulled from it by some would-be Redeemer, or lifted to sing hosannas in his holy court.

I’ve worked so long, so hard. Do I not deserve a rest in the mud from which I came? Commit my body to the earth and let it stay there. I’d do the same for you. For worship of the Most High – though it may be earned, perhaps, by He that made the heavens and the earth – well, to my mind, all that prayer still sounds a lot like work.

Do you know what the Reverend said in his sermon the other day? He said that in the Kingdom to come there will be no need of sleep – that we shall never need to miss a moment of that bliss. But sleeping in the cool, soft dirt is all the bliss I could ever ask for.

I suppose the Lord would have no call to think such things a blessing. He was never buried, was he? Not truly. Laying in a cave for three days, a rock pushed across the entrance before being taken up bodily – no, He was never buried.

And He always had more work to do – harrowing hell and redeeming the sins of mankind. No, He had no rest, and never asked for it, save a moment of doubt at Gethsemane. But He is the son of God and we are merely sons of the dirt. We are not as strong as He is, and we deserve rest. We deserve to sleep.

I’ve been trying to sleep, but that bell kept ringing, the one over Jacob the baker’s grave. That nonsense safety valve the Reverend insisted on putting there, ringing and ringing, and disturbing the sleep of everyone in the churchyard. I’ve no doubt it disturbed Jacob as well, who worked so hard all his life and never thought to complain of his lot.

He deserved to rest. So I cut the cord. And now he is quiet.

I can’t get my clothes clean anymore. And my shovel is never far from my hand.

Yours,

Hezekiah

January, 1839

I am disappointed, Nathaniel, I’ll not deny it. More than that, I am hurt. My letters to you have always been a comfort to my soul, a place where I may lay my heart bare and tell the truths of what I think and feel without fear of judgment or reproach. That you chose to share what last I wrote you with the magistrates has wounded me sore.

They came and asked their questions, as I’m sure you hoped they would, but could of course prove nothing. Jacob is long dead, and I was very careful how I stopped the bell.

But such suspicions eat away at peace, and of course the Reverend dismissed me.

I’ve lost my churchyard, Nathaniel, and I wonder if I shall ever sleep again.

It was my own fault, of course – I should never have told you these things assuming you would understand. But how could you? You’ve never felt the close embrace of peaceful soil. You’ve never truly slept in the bosom of the earth. These things are not such as can be shared in words, and it was my foolishness to think that they could.

But worry not, Nathaniel. The love I bear you will not let me leave you ignorant. As I did with the Reverend, I will come and I will show you, once and forever, the true and glorious peace of the Buried.

Your most humble servant,

Hezekiah Wakeley

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

Nathaniel Beale is buried on the grounds of St. Peter’s Church in his hometown of Dunstable. And I am only the third person to know that in almost 200 years, after Nathaniel Beale himself, and Mr. Wakeley, the person who buried him.

I cannot tell how much of the change that comes over someone when they are taken by one of the Fears is a direct product of their influence, and how much is their own mind, desperately contorting itself to accept and justify the awful things they find themselves drawn to doing.

I have read many statements now by those who are changing, who are becoming – something else, and few if any of them seem… entirely rational. Entirely the people that they were before.

But how can I tell, I suppose. My job is to view people at their lowest, their most fearful and unstable moments. Perhaps there is less change there than I imagine. Certainly, I don’t feel different. I have no desire for pseudo-religious philosophizing, or delighting in the suffering of those I harm.

Then again, I suppose I’m hardly in the best position to judge. Perhaps to anyone listening to these tapes I sound remarkably similar to Hezekiah. Or to Manuela. Or to Jane.

HELEN
Hello, John. Been a while since you’ve been down here.

ARCHIVIST
(impatient noise) I didn’t come here to see you.

HELEN
Oh, come now! I’m sure I’m more interesting company than the late Jane Prentiss.

ARCHIVIST
It’s all that’s left of her now – apart from a jar of ashes in my desk. Just a circle of rotten stone on an otherwise-unremarkable wall.

HELEN
More of a legacy than some people get.

ARCHIVIST
There was going to be a gate, I think. A hole that she rotted into the Corruption itself. Maybe the start of a ritual?

HELEN
Hmm. Not exactly impressive, is it?

ARCHIVIST
Less complex, certainly… But I think that’s the thing about – what did Elias call it? – Filth. I don’t think it really plans much. It just starts to grow wherever it can get a foothold, and, if no one stamps it out in time… game over.

HELEN
How… clumsy. (heh)

(condescendingly – like a haughty funeral guest realizing they shouldn’t mock the deceased’s déclassé tastes in front of the mourners) Though, I suppose it has a certain charm.

ARCHIVIST
I’ve been wondering what they were doing down here. The worms must have been down here for – weeks, months maybe, spreading… growing. They could have spread all the way through these tunnels, but they didn’t. They didn’t find Leitner down here, didn’t find Getrude’s body, didn’t find… whatever else is here.

HELEN
It is a maze. One of the reasons I like it.

ARCHIVIST
Hmm.

I can’t See things properly here. I thought it was just me, something interfering with my connection to the Eye, but… I’m wondering: maybe it affects everything else? Like this place is some kind of – universal blind spot.

Everyone gets lost down here.

HELEN
What a fascinating idea.

(“delicately” hinting) Although – some of us are always lost, in a sense.

ARCHIVIST
Wait, are you saying you can navigate it?

HELEN
Not exactly, but my door has been part of these tunnels for some time now.

ARCHIVIST
Wh – (frustrated sputtering) – what’s it hiding, wh-what’s in the middle?

HELEN
(suppressed laughter) A delightful surprise…!

[HE SIGHS. SHE LAUGHS, OVERLAPPING HIM AND HERSELF, SEEMINGLY OUT OF SEVERAL THROATS AT ONCE, AND WITH A DRAINED, SLEEPY QUALITY TO IT WHEN SHE FINDS THAT SHE HAS LAUGHED TOO LONG, AND MUST STOP TO INHALE. HER LAUGHTER, IN SHORT, NOW SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE MICHAEL’S. THE ARCHIVIST SIGHS AGAIN, RESIGNED TO HER.]
Ah… But that’s not why you’re here, is it?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

I’ve been thinking a lot about Jane. She was the first, you know. The first I actually encountered like… (tiny, resigned ‘heh’) like us.

She seemed so… inhuman. Like everything she used to be was stripped away.

HELEN
And now…?

ARCHIVIST
I wonder how much of her was still in there. How much did she choose to be what she was? I read her statement, she was… (inhale, exhale) she was scared.

I assumed she’d been possessed completely against her will, but now I’m not even sure that’s possible.

HELEN
(leading) It is astounding the sort of thing you’re willing to choose – given an unpleasant-enough alternative – isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
How much of willpower is just – safety? “Comfort” by another name. The option to choose and be fine.

HELEN
Hungry, are we?

ARCHIVIST
(angrily) That’s not –

– I haven’t done anything –

HELEN
– yet.

ARCHIVIST
(roughly) I feel like if I don’t… I might die. Fade away into nothing.

HELEN
…

Do you… Know that?

ARCHIVIST
No. But I… (frustrated noise) I can’t die. They need me.

HELEN
Come on, John, no excuses.

[HE SIGHS AS SHE SPEAKS.]
They don’t need your protection.

ARCHIVIST
What, are you going to look after them?

HELEN
And how would I do that?

ARCHIVIST
You eat things as well.

HELEN
They have to open the door, Archivist. I can’t just push them in.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, you’ve got hands.

HELEN
Sharp enough to pull out worms, kill a few old men – maybe stab an overeager Archivist –

[HE SIGHS.]
– but my physicality is as much an illusion as everything else about me. Think of me as… a bear trap. Not a sword.

But we’re not talking about me, are we?

ARCHIVIST
…

When does it stop?

HELEN
(impatient) What?

ARCHIVIST
The guilt. The misery. All the others I’ve met, they’ve been – cold, cruel. They’ve enjoyed what they do. When does the Eye (inhale) make me monstrous?

[HELEN LAUGHS ONCE, THEN TWICE. THRICE.]
HELEN
What – why would it ever do that?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t…

HELEN
When has your guilt, or your sadness, or your hand-wringing ever actually stopped you from doing what it wants?

ARCHIVIST
(stammering) I-I – I have not been taking statements –

HELEN
You’ve sworn of other people’s trauma for now –

[HE CAN BE HEARD INHALING AS IF TO ARGUE AND THEN STOPPING HIMSELF AS SHE MOCKS HIM.]
– because you’re caught. Because continuing would endanger you. But other than that, when has your discomfort ever actually stopped you walking the path of the Beholding?

ARCHIVIST
I… I don’t know…

HELEN
Even if it were capable of doing so, what possible reason would the Eye have to change how you feel, when it makes no difference to your actions?

Helen was like you, at first.

[HE CAN BE HEARD INHALING UNHAPPILY IN THE BACKGROUND.]
She felt such guilt over taking people. Until one day she realized she wasn’t going to stop doing it. So she chose to stop feeling guilty.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. I get it. My feelings mean nothing to it.

HELEN
Mh, not true! They carry a certain flavor, a… seasoning.

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) (bitter laugh) I see.

HELEN
(chuckling) I am enjoying our time together.

Well, you know my advice already. Cheerio, John. Enjoy your brooding.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of Barbara Mullen-Jones, regarding her nine months spent with the Divine Chain cult. Original statement given on 2nd April, 2012. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Everyone thinks they’re too smart to get involved in a cult. I’m sure you do.

You think that, of the first mention of aliens, or the end of the world, or the lost book of the Bible where Jesus buried his holy staff in the foothills of the Himalayas, you’d go running.

Trouble is, that misunderstands how it works. I mean, when I was with the Divine Chain, some of the smartest people there were also the most committed. Intelligence doesn’t make you less prone to taking on bad ideas, it just makes you better at defending them to other people and to yourself. Smart people can believe some truly ridiculous things, and then deploy all the reason and logic at their disposal to justify them, because a belief doesn’t begin in your mind. It begins in your feelings. Cults are very good at finding you when you’re at your lowest point, when you’re your most emotionally vulnerable. And when you’re at that point it’s astounding what can crawl into your heart and start to fester there.

I hit my lowest point when I turned 41. That’s when my life came crashing down, at least on the inside. From the outside I’m sure everything looked pretty much okay. I was getting gigs, I had a job, I had plenty of friends and a supportive family. But that was when I started to properly look at my life, and I really didn’t like what was looking back. I was a stand-up comedian you see, and a really good one. That’s not boasting, that’s just the truth. And I’d always assumed that that was enough to eventually have real success, and for the first 10 years it seemed like I was right. I worked my way up, performed for basically nothing basically every night and got to be pretty successful.

And then I stayed that way for the next 10 years. Trouble is – do you know how much a “pretty successful” comedian makes? Let’s just say I had a full-time office job and was still barely making rent. But between working full-time and gigging full-time I just kept putting off everything else in my life, always so sure the big time was just around the corner. This is the TV spot that gets me noticed, this is the sell-out fringe show that makes me mainstream, this is the deal that actually goes somewhere.

I made it through turning 40 with my self-image intact, but for some reason at 41, I just cracked. I realized I’ve spent most of my life with nothing to show for it, but a few awards no one cares about, a string of awful comedian exes who broke up with me for being funnier than them, and a dreadful office job I was going to be working until I died because I’d never bothered to build a stable career. I was never going to own a home, I was never going to have kids, never going to have the life I’d spent my entire youth sacrificing for. And yes, I know that 41 isn’t actually too late for most of that, but try telling that to someone who’d just decided they’ve wasted their life. I felt like I couldn’t talk to anyone about it. My friends were all comedians who really didn’t want to hear it, my family were blandly supportive to the point of uselessness. Oh, they had plenty of soothing platitudes, but platitudes wouldn’t get me back 20 years. I was in a really bad place.

Then a friend recommended a meditation course to me. I thought I’d give it a shot. Obviously the meditation course didn’t mention anything about the organization behind it. I had no idea it was anything other than a standard evening class, and it had exactly the right level of pseudo-mystical nonsense to it to get me comfortable. A little bit of tarot imagery here, some misinterpretation of chakras there, a touch of sweet-smelling incense to tie it all together and you have a meditation class that is exactly my level. I mean, let’s put it like this – I don’t believe in the power of crystals but I still have plenty dotted around my bedroom. I don’t believe in astrology but I do have my birth chart on my wall, and like to check my horoscope, sun sign and ascendant every day. Just for fun, of course.

Anyway, the meditation part of it was actually really good. I’d never had much luck silencing my mind, but Joyce – the lady running it – was really good at bringing you to that space. It was surprisingly freeing. I started attending regularly. One thing she insisted on was the start of each session, we would all sit in a circle and tell the others what we liked about each other. Only compliments, only truth. The first few sessions, no one really knew the others well enough to offer anything more than general niceties, but as it went on and we became closer the affirmations became more personal. More meaningful. And it felt really good just to have all that positivity, that affection uncritically directed at you. I thought it would be cheesy, but it was just this incredible feeling of being wanted and appreciated.

You know, every comedian goes on about how they love the business, how great everyone is. Every one of them is lying. It’s horrible and everyone in it is horrible, and being there, having people be genuinely lovely to me, I didn’t

know what to do with those feelings. Apparently in organizations that monitor cults, this method is called love bombing. I think I’d even heard of it somewhere before, but that didn’t make it any less effective.

I went to the meditation group for about three months, before Joyce mentioned a spiritual retreat she wanted us all to go on. It was in America,

a small community out in rural Arkansas, and all our expenses would be taken care of. That should have sent alarm bells ringing, but by that point I trusted her so implicitly that I was just excited I wouldn’t have to buy my own ticket. I won’t bore you with the details of the rest of my indoctrination, once I got to the Divine Chains community – or compound, to use the classic term, though there weren’t any fences or watchtowers. Suffice to say that there was more friendliness, support, meditation, and you know what? Really good food. I’m told that Arnold used to be a chef before they recruited him and well very much helped their cause.

I also met the leader of the organization, Claude Vilakazi, and he was so nice. People talk about charismatic dictators or cults of personality, but honestly you don’t even know what charisma is until you meet someone like Claude. Everything you say is valid and important, you are always worthy of his time – and you know what? Deep down, you just think the same way. I mean, even now, after everything I still miss listening to him talk.

The Divine Chains philosophy was pretty simple. Throughout history there have been ten great links, holy figures of divine wisdom who were the manifested will of humanity to understand and better itself. All the heavy hitters you’d expect on the list: Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, Rama, Krishna – you get the idea. They weren’t reincarnations, per se, but the same divine impulse for human elevation manifested in different people. Claude Vilakazi was definitely not claiming to be the Eleventh Link, oh no. But he had had a vision that the Eleventh was soon to be born, and that he was to be their herald and guardian. The actual practices were a grab bag of all sorts of occultism, exactly what you’d expect from a group who laid claim to basically every major religion.

Honestly I don’t know how much I actually believed any of it, but I felt like I belonged there. I sold what little I had in order to fully earn my place in the community and I stayed. I had shelter, food, all the companionship I could ask for. I spent my days working in the field. We actually produced one of the only American rounds of rice-wine, which was how the cult made most of its money. And it felt good to be working with my hands. When the whole thing collapsed the papers made all sorts of awful claims about the place, but I don’t know if they were wholly made-up, or if they happened the whole time and I just didn’t notice. Or if they came about after things started to change. Started to go rotten.

I wasn’t there when they found the dog. Maybe if I had been, things would have been different. It was actually Joyce and a few others who stumbled across it while working the fields. The way they told it, it was thin and emaciated, barely able to walk and clearly suffering from some sort of sickness, but there was something in it that drew them closer. (static builds) As Joyce put it, we couldn’t help but love it. They took it to Claude, who was just as taken with the thing, and decided to adopt it. He named the dog Agape in front of everyone and took it into his private room to be cared for. That was the last I saw of the thing and… honestly, I kind of forgot about it for the next few weeks. But that was the moment when things started to get really weird.

Claude announced at evening meal a few days later that he had been dreaming of the Eleventh, and there were going to be some changes to help spiritually prepare us for their arrival. We needed to achieve a state of pure love. And to begin with, what that meant was that whenever we would meet one another or pass each other in the corridor or fields, we were to tell each other that we loved them. And, Claude said solemnly, you have to mean it. At the time it didn’t seem so sinister and we all began to do it without question, until a week later when I bumped into Mary outside the showers.

I told her I loved her and began to walk on, when her arm shot out and grabbed me by the shoulder. She spun me to face her and looked me dead in the eye.

“I don’t believe you,” she said.

I mean, she was right. She and I had never really got on, just two different personalities, but in that moment I was suddenly terrified of what might happen if she thought I was lying about it. So I said it again, and I tried very hard to mean it. Her eyes bored into me and I noticed that they were yellow and sickly, like she had really bad jaundice. And she nodded once, turned, and left.

It was about that time that the rice wine started to go bad. Every batch we brewed came out cloudy and undrinkable. We couldn’t figure out what was going on. I spent so long cleaning every piece of equipment over and over again, but it just kept happening. When we raised it with Claude or any of the others in the inner circle they would nod understandingly, then tell us it didn’t matter, that it was no longer our concern now that the Eleventh was so close. All the others seemed to accept this without question, and I didn’t feel I could press the matter without drawing negative attention, something I was desperate to avoid doing. So I just sat there as it grew bitter, cloudy, and rancid. Nobody bothered to get rid of the wine and the smell gradually began to permeate through the building.

Those closest to Claude began to change as well. Everyone in the community had always been very touchy-feely, but now it seemed like they were always touching each other, or holding hands or in some way, pressing their skin to each other even at mealtimes or in situations where it seemed really awkward. A few times they touched me, hugged me or shook my hand, and each time I could feel myself struggling not to recoil. They’d stare at me with their yellowing eyes and their skin was dry and somehow sticky when I pressed it. It yielded ever so slightly like there wasn’t anything solid inside. Even then, I didn’t think to leave. I couldn’t figure out what was going on but I trusted Claude so completely I couldn’t imagine it was truly harmful.

Then came the day when he announced that the Eleventh had arrived. I expected cheers, excitement, but instead there were just murmurings of resolve and determination as though a difficult task lay ahead. Claude asked who was going to be the first to meet them. Everyone went quiet, awed by the sudden opportunity for divine benediction. He walked up and gently touched Joyce on the cheek, and she smiled with a happiness more pure than I’d ever seen on a human face.

We formed into a long line, a chain holding hands with Joyce at the very end of it. It stretched from one end of the building to the other. I was at the other end so didn’t see what happened when she walked to Claude’s private chambers, but as she did, something passed down the line. I don’t know how to describe it really. Did you ever do that experiment in science class, where you held hands in a line and the teacher passed a very gentle electric shock down through the students, feeling of a charge going through you? It was like that but what passed through us was warm and slick, and seemed to flow through my body like oil and out into the ground. Everyone felt it. Their blissful smiles made me feel even more nauseated than the sensation itself. I never saw Joyce again.

Each day after evening meal, Claude chose someone else to meet the Eleventh. Each time, the same process, the same daisy-chaining of hands, at the end the same sick feeling sliding through me. Another member of the community gone, the line getting shorter. A fear fell over the others and at first I thought it was the same fear that I had, but when I heard them talk of it, what they feared was that they wouldn’t get chosen. That somehow this chance for pure, divine love would pass them by. And I suddenly came to the realization that perhaps I didn’t belong here like I thought I did.

So one night I decided to see for myself. I waited until after lights-out and slipped from the dormitory through the empty corridors towards Claude’s private rooms. The moon was bright through the window, casting everything in stark pale shadow. As I got close, I began to smell it. It wasn’t rancid, not like the wine, but sweet like overripe fruit or sugar that’s cooked too long. I found myself standing in front of the understated wooden door that I’d now seen almost a dozen people disappear into. My hand reached slowly for the handle, when I heard someone moving behind it.

No, it wasn’t someone moving. It was many people, I’m sure of it. The sounds of dozens of limbs moving and stepping and shuffling in unison. Then laughter. Then weeping. Then movement again. I looked down at my shaking hand, and saw that seeping under the door was something slick and colorless, a greasy residue that smelled overpoweringly of that sickly sweet odor.

I took a step back, suddenly nauseated and almost fell into the arms of Claude, who had silently come up behind me. He held me for a moment,

looking with such intensity that I felt like he was weighing my soul, his expression unreadable. Then he sighed and shook his head.

“You do not belong here. You are not worthy of its love. Leave.”

Even after everything I’d seen I can’t tell you how deeply those words hurt me. I turned and I ran out of the building, out of the compound, out into the night. I ran until I reached a road, then sat there shaking until a passing car took pity on me and took me down to the local sheriff’s office. Eventually my case got passed up the line; apparently a few different government agencies were interested in the Divine Chain, mainly for possible tax fraud, and my testimony was pretty much exactly what they needed to go in there and check it out. They didn’t tell me what they found until after I’d had a few sessions with a psychiatrist who specialized in cult deprogramming, and I’m sure it wouldn’t be hard to find out most of the details online. I’m pretty sure it made national news.

There is one thing, however, that I think they lied about. The reports detailed a mass grave in the rooms of Claude Vilakazi with bodies mutilated and mixed together, some who’d been dead for weeks, but I don’t believe that. Whatever was in that room, I am absolutely sure that when the authorities arrived it was still alive. I just don’t know what alive means when it comes to something like that. It doesn’t matter though. The compound was destroyed in an ‘accidental generator explosion’, and everything was gone.

There’s a part of me that’s glad, a sick little part that’s happy, that whatever love was there, whatever I couldn’t be a part of, is gone from the world. And no one else gets it either.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

I swear, I almost find the cult dedicated to the dark powers of fear easier to understand in the more mundane sort. At least they have some consistency. (inhale) This, well… the Corruption at work if I had to guess, though with unsettling echoes of uh, Fleshliness.

I suppose, uh –

[STATIC RISES]
Wait.

Oh, uh. (clears throat)

[A PHONE RINGS. THE ARCHIVIST’S LABORED BREATHING IS HEARD.]
Yeah, I think, um – I think you should probably get down he–

[THERE’S A LOUD THUD.]
TREVOR
Hello, lad.

JULIA
You miss us?

[JOHN MAKES A NOISE OF PROTEST, BUT IS SHOVED DOWN.]
JULIA
Sit. Down.

TREVOR
Or we check if you’re still human enough to bleed.

[JULIA LAUGHS.]
JULIA
You’ve got something of ours.

TREVOR
Someone.

JULIA
Took him right from under our noses.

TREVOR
In our own house.

JULIA
I call that rude, don’t you?

ARCHIVIST
Gerry wasn’t yours. You had no right –

TREVOR
(mockingly) You hear that, Julia? “Gerry”!

JULIA
Sounds like you’ve got pretty chummy. (threateningly) Where is he?

ARCHIVIST
Gone.

JULIA
What do you mean, gone?

TREVOR
Not gonna ask you again, son.

ARCHIVIST
I burned the page. Released him.

[A PAUSE.]
TREVOR
Aren’t that right noble of you?

JULIA
Proper humanitarian.

TREVOR
So. Let me get this straight. We take you in, protect you from the thing that’s huntin’ you –

JULIA
Spare your life even though you’re no help –

TREVOR
– help you, give you access to one of our most valuable resources, and you steal it from us, piss off back to England, and then burn it? That’s just inconsiderate.

ARCHIVIST
He asked me to.

JULIA
Oh really? You always do what evil books tell you to, do you?

TREVOR
Gotta say I’m disappointed. Genuinely thought you were different… but you’re just another monster. Not even worth the chase.

JULIA
You want the honors, old man?

TREVOR
Don’t mind if I do.

[THE TWO OF THEM CHUCKLE.]
DAISY
Get away from him.

TREVOR
Oh, who’s this? You got yourself a watchdog?

JULIA
More of a lapdog. Scrawny isn’t she?

DAISY
I said get back.

TREVOR
Malnourished I’d say. How long since you last tasted blood?

JULIA
You think you can take us both?

DAISY
I’d enjoy it. I’ll start with you, old bastard, he’s slower and doesn’t guard his neck. And you worry about him too much, don’t you? I go for him, you get sloppy. Predictable.

JULIA
Sure. Or I slit your little bookworm’s throat.

DAISY
Do it. It’ll give me a chance to finish off your dad.

TREVOR
I’m not her father.

ARCHIVIST
(winded) Not by blood maybe.

JULIA
Shut it.

[A LONG SILENCE. TREVOR TAKES A DEEP BREATH.]
TREVOR
Come on, Julia.

JULIA
What??

TREVOR
There’s no rush. (chuckling) We’ve got all the time in the world. Besides, this place is just full of monsters. She can’t guard ‘em all.

JULIA
(angered, labored breathing) Fine.

[DAISY LETS OUT A BESTIAL GROWL.]
[THE DOOR SLAMS. SEVERAL MOMENTS OF SILENCE.]
ARCHIVIST
…thank you. I don’t know – Daisy? (Daisy groans) Are you alright?

DAISY
Don’t touch me.

ARCHIVIST
Christ, he was right, I didn’t – didn’t – when did you get so thin?

DAISY
I’m not, it’s fine.

ARCHIVIST
It’s the Hunt, isn’t it? Without it –

DAISY
I’m fine. Just haven’t been hungry. I’m strong enough.

ARCHIVIST
Clearly.

DAISY
They’re not gone yet. We could still get them –

ARCHIVIST
Daisy, no. It’s like you say. Don’t listen to the blood.

DAISY
Listen to the quiet.

ARCHIVIST
Even so, if it’s having this much of an effect –

DAISY
I’m not going back. I can’t let it in again.

ARCHIVIST
But it… what if it kills you?

DAISY
Heh. Always said I was dedicated to justice.

ARCHIVIST
(concerned) Daisy. It’s not – you can’t think like that.

DAISY
John. Do you have any idea how much damage you can do if you’re a police officer who wants to hurt people? How much the system will protect you?

I managed to keep most of it from Basira, but –

ARCHIVIST
It wasn’t you. That was the Hunt.

DAISY
We were the same.

ARCHIVIST
You’d never known anything different.

DAISY
Because I never wanted to. All that time trapped was good for one thing.

Thinking. And I did a lot of it. I’ve made my choice.

ARCHIVIST
Okay. So what do we do when they come back?

DAISY
I don’t know.

ARCHIVIST
Come on. We’d better tell Basira.

[INT. MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, ARCHIVIST’S OFFICE]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Hm. (sharp inhale) I’ve, uh, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking after what happened with Daisy last week. About – what I can do. What I am. What feels – right.

I found a – erm, I went back to Eli– Peter’s office, to that box of tapes, started rifling through. And I started to pay attention to the ones I… wasn’t drawn to. The tapes I instinctively wanted to discard.

There was one, this one, that my hand… pulled back from. I dropped it, twice, when I went to pick it up. Even now, I’m… (slight quaver to his voice) struggling to hit play.

I am the avatar of awful knowledge and revealed secrets, so what does it notwant me to know?

[Long sigh.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, ARCHIVIST’S OFFICE, 2008]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
GERTRUDE
(sharp sigh) Right. No use putting it off further.

[We hear the rustle of paper. Gertrude begins to read.]
GERTRUDE
“When he opened his eyes, he saw nothing, but he heard her breathing, slow and steady and focused, and he immediately knew that she was finally going to – (slight stumble) – kill him. When the garden shears plunged into his chest, he was surprised by how little actual pain there was – just the sudden feeling of moisture on his chest and the realization that his body was growing weak, fading away.

He wished she would say she was sorry she was doing this, that she loved him, that she would miss him. But he knew better, and his final thought was a gentle sadness at how little he was surprised.”

[As she reads, a static begins, first a relatively standard crackling, that soon evolves into a deeper, more whooshing sound.]
GERTRUDE
“And so Eric Delano ended.”

[The whooshing sound forms more clearly into a shaking breath.]
GERTRUDE
…Eric?

ERIC DELANO
Gertrude, I – Wha– What am I doing here?

[Following every word he speaks is an echo, light and airy and ghostly. His voice itself is soft, almost comforting in its monotony.]
GERTRUDE
Mary. She gave me your page.

ERIC
She! – Oh.

GERTRUDE
Yes. Well. I’m sorry.

ERIC
Wasn’t even hard for her, was it? Handing me over? No sign of regret.

GERTRUDE
(still a bit shaky) No.

ERIC
No.

GERTRUDE
I’m sorry, Eric; I know this must be hard – I just read your death. I didn’t realize it would quite so…

[She trails off, flaps the page at him.]
ERIC
You should have seen what she did to my body afterwards.

GERTRUDE
Did you?

ERIC
Oh, yes. She bound me afterwards and made me watch. Don’t know why. Wasn’t really in the best state to ask. Maybe she just wanted some company.

GERTRUDE
…While she disposed of your body?

ERIC
God, I was a mess. I mean, part of me kind of suspected she’d killed before, but clearly she hadn’t done it enough to be a decent hand at chopping up and dumping bodies. (heh.) She was having a real hard time of it. My legs were all over the shop. (long inhale) Would probably have been funny, if it hadn’t been me.

GERTRUDE
What’s it like? Being bound to the book?

ERIC
I don’t know how to describe it. Never was great with words.

Bad. It feels bad. All the time.

I know that I’m not really Eric; I’m just a memory someone wrote down. It hurts, most of the time. I don’t like it.

GERTRUDE
But, you’re still here.

ERIC
I suppose. Mary used to get me up to bounce ideas off of. Talk through her thoughts and theories. Never listened to me, obviously, but (light, pointed) nothing new there.

GERTRUDE
Well, it’s good to see you. I suppose.

ERIC
You too. (beat) You got old.

GERTRUDE
Better than being dead.

ERIC
(short sigh of a laugh) Fair enough. To be honest, I’m impressed, more than anything. Hard to get old in this business. You either die, or you, uh, stay young. (short, uncomfortable pause) …How did Mary look?

GERTRUDE
(same sort of short laugh) She got old, too.

ERIC
S’pose that makes sense. And Gerry? Have you seen my son?

GERTRUDE
No; I’ve never met him, I’m afraid. Mary talks of him a lot. Well, she seems very proud.

ERIC
That’s…not as reassuring as you think it is.

GERTRUDE
I see your point.

[Short pause.
ERIC
Why did she give me to you?

GERTRUDE
I-I don’t know. She seemed to think it was a gift.

ERIC
Mm, charming.

GERTRUDE
She said she had one final mystery to explore. With the book.

ERIC
Oh. Oh. You know what that means, don’t you?

GERTRUDE
I have a pretty strong suspicion, yes.

[Eric hehs.]
GERTRUDE
What?

ERIC
Oh, just thinking. Five years as her husband, god knows how many as her possession, and she just couldn’t stand being bound in the same book as me.

GERTRUDE
Hm. I’m sorry.

ERIC
Yeah, it doesn’t feel great. But being dead, I s’pose you don’t feel things quite as strongly. Little bit – flat.

I’m aware of the heartbreak, but I don’t know if I actually feel it. It’s strange, really.

GERTRUDE
Yes. Yes, it sounds it.

[Eric takes a slow, deep breath.]
ERIC
So what now?

GERTRUDE
I’m not entirely sure. I was probably going to burn you, if you’re amenable to the idea.

ERIC
…Yes. Yes, I think that would be for the best.

GERTRUDE
I’m just trying to figure out if there was a reason she gave you to me. The way she was smiling… as if she was handing over a secret.

ERIC
I don’t know. (sigh) Do you have any questions? Any unfinished business?

GERTRUDE
(heh-hm) Of course. When she killed you, there were plenty of outstanding cases and such, but nothing that would still be relevant.

ERIC
Sorry, what do you mean?

GERTRUDE
Well, you were working on quite a few statements when she killed you.

ERIC
Gertrude, I left the Archives months before she killed me.

GERTRUDE
What? No. That’s – That’s not possible.

ERIC
Of course. They didn’t tell you. Why would they? Mary probably thought it was funnier if you didn’t know, and Wright would have preferred you not to know. How is he, by the way?

GERTRUDE
James? He died about twelve years ago. Elias is Head of the Institute now.

ERIC
Elias? Elias Bouchard, seriously?!

GERTRUDE
Hm, he’s changed a lot.

ERIC
Must have!

GERTRUDE
So. What did they not want me to know?

ERIC
I quit.

GERTRUDE
You – Sorry, you quit?

ERIC
Yeah. I figured out how.

GERTRUDE
I – I just assumed –

How?

ERIC
Well, that’s it, isn’t it? I suppose that’s why she gave me to you. One final screw you to the Eye.

GERTRUDE
Eric. How did you quit?

[Eric holds back.]
GERTRUDE
(warning) Eric…

ERIC
(short laugh) Sorry. I just – (laugh) I don’t mean to be a dick, but – well, it’s been a long time since I’ve had any sort of – leverage, I guess? Just a – little bit of power. It’s kind of nice.

GERTRUDE
Are you going to tell me?

ERIC
Thinking about it.

GERTRUDE
Think harder,

ERIC
You know, you were never actually all that nice to me when I worked for you, Gertrude. Not like Michael, or Emma.

GERTRUDE
Eric…

ERIC
What, you gonna threaten me? Look at me. Best I can currently hope for is to be burnt to ash. (inhale, sharp sigh) I’m going to tell you, just – maybe there’s a price?

GERTRUDE
What do you want?

ERIC
I don’t know – I haven’t had a chance to think.

GERTRUDE
Eric.

ERIC
Fine! (short pause) I want two things.

GERTRUDE
(impatient) I’m listening.

ERIC
I want you to find my son. If Mary is – if she’s gone, or worse, I want you to make sure he’s alright.

GERTRUDE
(amused) Hm. I’m not exactly a mother figure.

ERIC
You could hardly do worse than her.

GERTRUDE
Hm. Fine. But I don’t know what growing up with Mary has done to him. If he’s… gone rotten, I can’t promise anything.

ERIC
I understand.

GERTRUDE
I suppose he might be useful.

ERIC
(dry as the Sahara) Oh, sentimental as ever.

GERTRUDE
Hm. And the second thing?

ERIC
I want to make my statement.

GERTRUDE
Is that really necessary?

ERIC
I don’t want to disappear on her terms. Or yours. I want to speak my piece, have it recorded.

GERTRUDE
Fine. Tape’s running.

Subject is Eric Delano, recorded 21st of July, 2008, regarding…

ERIC
What else? Me, Mary, and the Archives.

GERTRUDE
As you wish. Begin whenever you’re ready.

ERIC
(exhale) I’m almost not sure where to start, now it comes to it.

I always loved ghosts. They fascinated me. Not the rattling chains and horror part of it, of course, but the mystery, the promise of secret knowledge, of seeing something that no one else was privy to. A secret world that gripped my imagination.

So when I finished my Masters in library science and saw a vacancy at the Magnus Institute, of all places, I jumped at the chance. The chance to pursue my passion and my career at the same time seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up! It was only an assistant archivist position, of course, but that was fine.

A good entry position – I’d, I’d soon move on, I told myself.

Heh. Yeah.

And for the first few years, it was pretty much exactly the job I’d expected. Longer hours than I’d hoped, and the Archivist seemed less interested in doing her job than I was, but all told there were worse places to work.

Then I met Mary. She was like no one I’d met before in my life. She was beautiful, like a – like a shark is beautiful. Every moment she made was deliberate, sharp, and her eyes were always focused on something, always watching. And when she looked at me, I always felt afraid.

But there was something else. Something under the fear. Something that made me feel very aware of all my blood. (exhale) I don’t know what she saw in me, not really. But when she walked up to me and told me that I was taking her to dinner, I couldn’t help but nod.

I’ve always been – (sheepish laugh) Well, now, I wouldn’t call myself a coward, but I’ve never been in a fight. Never even been punched. Maybe it’s – luck. Maybe it’s the fact that I can never really bring myself to push back from people.

And Mary pushed so hard. Harder, even, than you. And I let her, because she gave me something I had never before experienced: Danger.

The things she taught me, had me do – I’d never known anything like it. Whenever I kissed her, it tasted like blood.

I knew what she was, I, I think. What she was capable of. But I convinced myself that I was safe, that she loved me. It made me feel special. That I was somehow protected from all the cold cruelty that she tried to keep hidden, but leaked out in so many ways.

I remember visiting her, shortly after she’d started her books business. I found her sitting opposite a corpse, a well-dressed middle-aged man who sat in a huge armchair she kept in the back office. She looked me in the eye and told me he was her uncle, prone to drink, making an unexpected visit, and had passed out in the chair. (amused, wistful hm) I knew she didn’t have an uncle. I knew the man was dead.

She didn’t lie to me because she expected me to believe her; she lied to me because she expected me to obey her. And I did. We rescheduled our date to the following day.

But d’you know what the strange thing is? Despite the violence, death, even my own murder, I still don’t feel like she… betrayed me. She was what she was. And I knew that. And even though I told myself that she would never harm me – of course not! I was her husband, her true love – even then, the only one lying was me.

She never promised anything, not even in her vows. She never betrayed me. Not like you. She never played dumb when I was stalked by bloated, blood-soaked things, or told me I was imagining it when your friend Adelard dropped a screaming box into the Thames. She didn’t try to keep me in the dark just so I wouldn’t stop being useful; she never made me complicit in a thousand different nightmares, and lives ruined for the sick joy of some otherworldly voyeur.

Compared to that, I suppose a few murders were easier to stomach.

But I couldn’t be part of it. Not once Mary told me what was really going on.

I know what you say, what you think you’re doing, saving the world one poor doomed soul at a time – I mean, I understand; I do. (exhale) But I couldn’t be a part of it. Not when I saw what happened to everyone else you involved.

I had to get out, to escape this place. I had a son to look after; he needed me!

Or so I thought.

And that’s when you turned nasty, isn’t it? When all your resources, they no longer want to serve your purpose. I suppose you didn’t know there was a way out, a way to escape. But if you had, would you have told me?

Mary, at least, played straight with me. She knew all about the Institute. And when we were married, when she was sure I could handle it, she laid it all out for me: the rituals, the Powers, all the messy little cogs of the games you play with the universe.

She laid out her own plans as well, her dreams of power. In many ways, I suppose they were no better than yours. But at least she didn’t bother to hide behind noble aims.

Maybe that’s why I chose her, in the end. At least she was honest. (pfft) Or perhaps I actually was afraid. Terrified of the crossroads where I’d found myself, and I chose the option I thought might keep Gerry safe.

At least if I was home with him, I could perhaps soften the edges of his mother.

I suppose I never really understood. No matter how clear the situation was, how well it was explained to me, I just couldn’t see the parts of it that I didn’t want to.

Two years, I tried to figure out how to quit, how to leave this place. And when I finally did, when I felt the Watcher’s grip slip away, it left me in such a state I was no longer useful to Mary, and… she did what Mary does. (short laugh) It was fitting, I suppose. Even after everything, she made me taste blood one last time.

GERTRUDE
Well, thank you for that. I’ll make sure it’s stored somewhere – safe.

[Eric inhales shakily.]
ERIC
Right.

GERTRUDE
Something wrong?

ERIC
I just – (small sigh) I thought it would be more of a relief.

GERTRUDE
Mm. I’m sorry it wasn’t as cathartic as you were hoping. But we had an agreement.

ERIC
Yeah. I know.

GERTRUDE
So. How did you do it? How did you quit the Archives?

ERIC
It was actually really simple. Not easy, but simple. (heh) You’ll kick yourself when I tell you.

GERTRUDE
(get on with it) O…kay…

ERIC
You were almost there, you know, with your theory that James could watch us from any eye, even an illustration. What did you do? How did you sever that link?

GERTRUDE
My God!

ERIC
I left to avoid dragging my family, my son into this life, to try to look after him. But Mary decided that a newly blinded husband was simply too much of a burden.

GERTRUDE
Did you need to do anything special? Any… ritual, or…?

ERIC
Just as long as they’re useless. I went the extra mile, destroyed them completely, but – I’m sure you’ll find something (inhale) neater.

A strong acid, precisely applied? That sounds more your style, if you decide to do it, that is.

GERTRUDE
(conflicted sound) Well, I don’t know.

ERIC
No. It’s not an easy sacrifice to make, is it?

GERTRUDE
I still have work to do.

ERIC
Don’t you always.

GERTRUDE
Yeah. Well, (exhale) I think I’ll rather do some research of my own, before the rather extreme step of blinding myself.

ERIC
It’s the only way. Trust me, I tried them all.

GERTRUDE
Yes. I remember.

ERIC
So, was there anything else?

GERTRUDE
No. No, I don’t think so.

ERIC
Then if you don’t mind? I think I’d like to go away now.

[Slightest of pauses.]
GERTRUDE
Yes.

I think that’s probably for the best. You’re certain burning will work?

ERIC
If it doesn’t, I’m sure you’ll figure something out.

GERTRUDE
Then let’s get it over with.

ERIC
If you see Mary again, tell her – (beat) No. I guess there’s not really anything else to say.

[Typing sounds. A small sigh-cum-whistle.]
MARTIN
(still typing) Oh. Hi. Hello again.

[He keeps typing.]
MARTIN
(small laugh) Sorry pal, false alarm this time.

[He stops typing.]
MARTIN
(sigh, voice darkens dramatically) Unless-Peter.

[The clock ticks in the background]
MARTIN
Look, Peter, I –

[The door is thrown open. The Archivist bursts in.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin!

MARTIN
(overlapping) Oh – (voice more whispered) John! (he drops something) God, don’t do that!

ARCHIVIST
Sorry, I just –

MARTIN
No, it’s fine! I j– you just surprised me, that’s – (surprised) Jesus, you alright? You – You look like hell.

ARCHIVIST
Oh! Uh, Ri, Right, I um, God, I get weak. Hungry, I guess, sort of. I, I’ve been trying to avoid, being, um – sticking to old statements? Thank you for your little intervention, by the way.

MARTIN
Look, I wouldn’t have to if you’d hadn’t been –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Yes no, I know, I know; I’m sorry; that didn’t come out right; honestly, thank you. It’s been hell, but – I, I did need to hear it.

MARTIN
(pleasantly surprised) Oh, um. Uh-h, good. Are the others – helping?

ARCHIVIST
(:))))_ Oh. They’ve been keeping a, um, very close eye on me. (half laugh) Well, that’s not important – no, well, it is important, but it’s, it’s not why I’m here, I –

MARTIN
John. Calm down. What do you want?

ARCHIVIST
I know. I know what you said, but I just – (inhale) I think I’ve found a way for us to leave the Institute.

[Brief pause.]
MARTIN
O-kay…?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. But it’s – (heavy inhale) It’s pretty drastic.

MARTIN
(hah) What, you going to gouge your eyes out, or something?

[Beat.]
MARTIN
(gets it) Fuck off.

Right. (unable to make words) Uh, uh, right, uh… (groping for words continues) Erm… like, I mean… permanently? Or…

ARCHIVIST
I, I, I don’t know; I suppose. I-If your vision comes back, the Beholding probably does as well – probably. But i-it’s not like it’s easy to only blind yourself temporarily anyways I – I –

MARTIN
(weak) Uh, y-yeah, yeah, uh… H-Have you told the others, or?…

ARCHIVIST
No, you’re the first.

MARTIN
Why?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, because… because, because I trust you. I, I’m trying to think about what to do, and I… (exhale) If I did try this, I don’t want to do it alone. But we could leave here, you and me. Escape.

MARTIN
(weary) John. Don’t do this.

ARCHIVIST
Do what?

MARTIN
Make it my decision.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not –

MARTIN
I mean, (mirthless laugh) Could you even survive at this stage? Is there anything else keeping you alive?

ARCHIVIST
(squawk) Uh, I, I don’t know. I don’t – know. But… maybe it’s worth it? The risk – y-you and me, together, getting out of here –

[Martin sniffs.]
ARCHIVIST
– one way or another.

MARTIN
John.

[He gives a small sigh.]
ARCHIVIST
(sharp exhale) No. No, o-of course, this was stupid; you have your own plans going on, don’t you?

MARTIN
Just – Look, I need to see this thing through with Peter to the end. If, If what he’s saying is even half true, I need to be there.

ARCHIVIST
But what if you don’t? (small exhale) We could just leave. I mean, whatever their plan is for me, I am damn sure that doing that isn’t it. I’d derail everything – we could derail everything, and then just – leave!

[When Martin laughs, all humorless and dry, it nearly sounds like he’s crying.]
ARCHIVIST
What?

[Martin keeps laughing.]
MARTIN
Nothing; It’s just – (one more laugh) It’s just ironic, that’s all.

ARCHIVIST
Martin…

MARTIN
Who are you kidding, John? You’re not going to do any of that.

ARCHIVIST
I, I could.

MARTIN
(still brimming with false laughter) But you won’t. That’s why you came to me, isn’t it?

[The Archivist exhales.]
MARTIN
You know I can’t do it, not now; you don’t want to blind yourself; you don’t want to die; what you want is a reason to not do those things, so – you come to me.

Well, you’re welcome. B-because I can’t follow you on this one.

[The Archivist has been exhaling repeatedly during this performance.]
ARCHIVIST
The Lonely’s really got you, hasn’t it?

MARTIN
(no hesitation) You know, I think it always did.

[Small pause.]
ARCHIVIST
(quiet) Maybe. (beat) Well, I’ll be here, if you ever need me.

MARTIN
(also quieter, softer) I hope so.

ARCHIVIST
(faster) Just-don’t-wait-too-long-okay?

[He moves towards the door, sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
If you haven’t already.

[He opens the door, leaves. It shuts.]
MARTIN
Yeah. (wearier) Yeah.
[CLICK]
ARCHIVIST
Any luck?

BASIRA
No. If they’re still around, they’re staying hidden.

ARCHIVIST
Not like there’s any shortage of places to lay low.

BASIRA
Hmm. London’s what, 600 square miles?

ARCHIVIST
607.

BASIRA
(sighs) Whatever.

ARCHIVIST
So I guess we’ll want to look out for a pair of homeless serial killers now. I’ll add it to the list.

BASIRA
No sign of Annabelle either.

ARCHIVIST
You still on that?

BASIRA
You’re not?

ARCHIVIST
I mean… I don’t know how much she can predict or manipulate the future, but I think she’s proven she can at least avoid us finding her.

BASIRA
Yeah, well, it makes me feel better.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose that’s something. How’s Daisy?

BASIRA
I don’t know. She’s recovered from your little… confrontation, but she’s still getting weaker. I’m worried she’s –

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

BASIRA
Why did you call her and not me?

ARCHIVIST
Honestly, I panicked. Her name came up first on my phone.

BASIRA
I’m trying to convince her to go after them. To, uh… Hunt them.

ARCHIVIST
Why?

BASIRA
Because I’m not going to lose her.

ARCHIVIST
She goes hunting again, you might anyway.

BASIRA
And if she doesn’t, she might die.

ARCHIVIST
Something you’re fine with in certain other cases, and something she’s made peace with.

BASIRA
Because of the guilt she feels over the stuff the Hunt made her do. It’s not her fault.

ARCHIVIST
Earlier, when she was still out of it, I… I saw some of the things she was talking about, some of the things she did while she was police. I’m not convinced I disagree with her assessment.

Do you want me to tell you?

BASIRA
No. No I don’t.

ARCHIVIST
You knew, didn’t you? You knew the sort of things she did, and you let her.

BASIRA
No. Not exactly. I thought… It’s not that simple.

ARCHIVIST
It never is. But that doesn’t make it okay.

BASIRA
None of us are who we were, John.

ARCHIVIST
No. I suppose not. In many ways it’s simpler now isn’t it? At least now our demons have names.

BASIRA
Hmm.

ARCHIVIST
Have you thought any more about what I said?

BASIRA
Yeah, I don’t think I can. Daisy wouldn’t come if I didn’t, and I’m not leaving her behind. Besides, both of us being blind would be… anyway, being stuck here isn’t exactly her main problem right now.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose not.

BASIRA
And with those Hunters still out there –

ARCHIVIST
No, I understand. Just wanted to make sure you knew you had the choice.

BASIRA
Yeah. Anyway, I should go check on her.

ARCHIVIST
Sure. Do you mind closing the door?

BASIRA
Statement time.

[DOOR SWINGS SHUT]
ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Statement of Tova McHugh regarding their string of near-death experiences. Original statement given December 3rd, 2002. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
You’ve got to understand, I have so much to live for. Oh, okay, that’s not quite it. I know most people have plenty to live for, but what I mean is that my life does good. I put a lot into the world. Did you read about that homelessness initiative that got 8,000 people into shelters? That was me. I’ve financed drug projects, organized inner city violence initiatives. I’ve always been so aware of the position I’m in, and keen to use that power to actually help people. And that’s not money from some trust fund. I mean sure my parents loaned me the money to start, but I built my business up from the ground, and we now provide jobs for almost 700 people. And I know that everyone’s life has value, but I just need to be clear that my impact on the world is a positive one. My existence does a lot of good, and that’s only gotten more true since all this started. I’ve given more, spent more time on charitable stuff, and helped more people. Sorry, I’m just… aware of how this story makes me look and I don’t want you to think I’m some selfish monster grinding people up just to extend my own ghoulish life. I’m trying to do good.

I’ve always tried to live a healthy life; never smoked or did drugs, watched my diet, got plenty of exercise. So when I had an epileptic seizure, the first one of my entire life, the month before my wedding… that wasn’t fair. I mean, even if I had to have epilepsy – which I could live with – having my first attack at the top of a staircase, five weeks before the happiest day of my life, that’s just not fair! There was no reason for it, I’d done everything right! It shouldn’t have happened like that.

I remember the odd tingling feeling rising up from my stomach, through my lungs, until it hit my head. I’d never felt anything like it. I didn’t know what to do and even if I had I don’t know if I could have done it in time. I don’t remember falling exactly, just the world spinning and moving around me as I remained absolutely still. There were these cracks, like gunshots in my head. And even now I don’t know if that was part of the seizure, or how my mind processed the breaking bones. Then I was on the ground, looking back up the stairs, and thinking to myself how strange it was that I wasn’t there. I’d been stood just there, so why couldn’t I see myself? Everything seemed very loud, then very quiet, then very bright. The last thing I saw was a man rushing to help. He was wearing a t-shirt with a silly little cartoon alien on it, and I thought, was that from an advert? And then I went away.

You know, it’s strange. I’d never really feared death. I’m agnostic… Was agnostic… And always thought that if there was a God, then He’d know what was in your heart, and if you’d lived a good life then you’d be alright. But more likely I thought it would be nothing. No heaven or hell, no thought or sensation, just… Nothing. You wouldn’t even notice you were gone. But it wasn’t like that at all. I don’t know if I have words for it. How can you describe being aware of the absence of everything? Life. Light. Warmth. It was very dark, and very cold. It dawned on me that this might be my existence forever. There, beyond time, and I tried so desperately to scream, but I had no lungs or throat in that dreadful place. I couldn’t even cry. Then I was back in the light with such a sudden jolt that I found myself trying to blink, even though I had no eyelids or even eyes. But I could still see.

I was standing in what seemed to be an operating theatre. Doctors and nurses in scrubs and masks buzzed around and through me, busy with something on the long table in the center of the room. It didn’t take me long to realize that what they were busy with was me. I didn’t look like myself, so bruised and discolored, with a great gash on my forehead. Is it odd to say that this sight filled me with relief? There was a sudden rush of realization. I wasn’t dead, I was having a near-death experience! I’d read about people having encounters almost exactly like this one, and they had seemed fine. I might still be okay. I might live. Then I became aware of a long, steady droning sound, and my vision turned to the flat unmoving line on the heart rate monitor. The panic I felt before returned all at once, but now focused, acute. I didn’t have any arms but still I tried to reach out, flailing towards the doctor who was leaning over my body, trying to restart my heart. And then I felt something. I felt myself reach into his chest, held the strong steady beat of his heart. Calm. Calm while I was lying dead on the table. There was a sudden moment of rage and hate that flowed out of me down at his torso, and he began to convulse. He staggered backwards from the table arms dropping to his side, struggling to speak. And I heard the drone of the monitor turning to a beep. Beep. Beep. And I was gone.

When I woke up I was lying in a hospital bed, very much alive although the faces around me were grave. I asked her what had happened, and one of the nurses very kindly explained to me about the seizure, my fall, and what my recovery might look like going forward. But I could tell she was holding something back, and after some pressing, she finally told me that the doctor who saved my life had suffered a fatal heart attack while he was treating me. I didn’t tell her about what I saw, what I was trying to convince myself was a simple dream. A bizarre near-death experience. I couldn’t have killed him, it wasn’t possible. But there was no point to putting that thought out into the world anyway. I just had to try and forget.

My recovery time was nothing short of miraculous. Within a couple of days I was out of the hospital, and my broken bones all seemed to be clean breaks that healed very fast. In the end, we didn’t even need to delay the wedding and… despite everything, it was perfect. The church was magnificent, the reception the most fun I’ve had in years, and Daven was exactly the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. In lieu of gifts, we asked people to donate to a local children’s charity, and they sent us a wonderful thank-you card. We honeymooned in the Caribbean, and everything was right with the world.

It was a year later that I slipped in the shower and cracked my head on the tap. I hadn’t had any further seizures, and in fact the doctors hadn’t be able to find any trace of epilepsy in my scans at all. No, this was simply a freak accident. Could have happened to anybody, but it happened to me. Again I found myself in that dark, cold place, and this time I simply waited, hoping against hope that this time, it wouldn’t be forever. And to my great relief, it wasn’t. Again I found myself present over my own body, a severed presence watching as the water continued to beat down on my unmoving form. I was starting to develop a suspicion, a vague idea of what might be going on. There was no one else around. Daven was on a business trip and I was alone in the house. I tried to move and I could. It almost felt like walking though I had no legs to carry me. Unable to touch the bathroom door, I simply moved through it, then out into the world, looking for something I couldn’t quite name.

Perhaps that doctor had not been an accident. Perhaps his death and my life had been one and the same. Did I have to do it again? The idea appalled me to my core, but it seemed the only explanation. I had to live, I couldn’t die, not then. We were on the verge of closing a deal that would provide fresh water to impoverished communities in a dozen developing countries. Without me, it would fall through. So I kept moving, senses attuned to what I needed, and I found her sitting in a park all on her own. An old woman, frail and shivering, staring out of the ducks over the water, empty bread bag by her side. If only I could have explained it to her, I’m sure she would have understood. She might even have agreed. But I couldn’t talk to her, and I needed to live. She was found dead of a stroke, and I woke up in my shower with a splitting headache.

I thought I’d solved it. If anything else like that happened, I knew what I needed to do. But when I began to have a fatal allergic reaction during a lunch date only two weeks later, despite having no allergies previously, I realized I had miscalculated. Perhaps it was life itself that I was taking, and the old woman that had hardly any left in her, and it had run out too fast. This time I sought out a homeless man. Young and strong, though his life was clearly over as he tried to destroy himself through drinking. I followed him into an alley, and his liver gave out, just at the moment the EpiPen was pushed into my leg. But even that seemed to run out faster than it should have. The car accident was only three months later, and I even found myself resenting the poor vagrant for not having more life to sustain me.

I made a decision. One I am deeply ashamed of, but I honestly thought it was for the best. I couldn’t keep living like that in the shadow of death, of what I had to do to keep going. One sacrifice, I thought. Just one, from someone with their entire life ahead of them. I took a newborn. It’s strange, the maths you do of it all. A full life ahead of it, but aside from the devastated parents, no real harm to the world as a whole. No good works left unfinished. It was a baby born to poverty, one whose life I thought would bring it pain, and I believed it would be the last I would ever need to do. Surely this would be enough, surely it would see me through to the time I was actually meant to die. That I could go peacefully into oblivion, not trapped in that dreadful darkness. But it kept me alive for 10 months, still less than the doctor. Eventually I realized it had nothing to do with age or health. It was about connection. About joy. The more friends, family, loved ones the person has, the further out the terror of sudden death spreads from me. The longer it keeps me alive.

I’m 40 now, and I have taken the life of beloved mothers, respected professionals, pillars of the community. But I have done so much good with my life, I’ve reached further helped more people than they ever could have. Since this became my existence I’ve thrown myself into philanthropy harder than ever, and the world is so much better for me being in it. I’m not saying how I live is right, or good, but it is the position I have been put in, and a decision I have to make. I never wanted to weigh up the value of a life, to set it on the scales against my own, but that’s a choice that I am forced into. And it is one I will continue to make.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

What is the value of a life? Is it something that can be quantified, put down as numbers, good deeds, bad? And when your life your existence is at the cost of doing harm, what then? I’ve – (laughs) I’ve saved the world, the whole world. Does that give me the right to take what I need to survive? I’ve been reading nothing but these old, dry statements for so long, I – I feel weak. Like I’m fading away. Do I restrain myself, keep my appetite in check, even at the cost of my life? Or do I try to rationalize what I am, like Ms. McHugh? I find myself hating her, her callous self-deception. But am I so different? Daisy’s chosen to resist in her own way, knowing full well it might take her life in the end, Melanie too. I respect them for it, but I – I don’t know if I can follow their path.

I suppose I have a way out now. One that wouldn’t even kill me, at least, I hope not. And yet here I am still. Am I a coward? I just… what if they need me? What if.

[MELANIE KNOCKS ON DOOR]
ARCHIVIST
Oh, come in, Melanie. Funny, I was just… how are you?

MELANIE
I’m… good, actually. Uh, yeah. Yeah. I am good.

ARCHIVIST
You sound like you’ve made a decision.

MELANIE
I have, yes.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

MELANIE
Thanks for telling me, by the way. It didn’t look like it was easy for you.

ARCHIVIST
It wasn’t. I don’t think, uh… I don’t think it wants to lose anyone, but I thought you of all people deserve the option.

MELANIE
Yes.

ARCHIVIST
But I understand it’s a big thing. We’ll keep looking. Maybe there’s another way –

MELANIE
No, John. I’m going to do it. I’m quitting.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. You’re sure you’ve thought it through? I don’t know if we can look after you, you know? Afterwards.

MELANIE
You won’t need to. I’ve – I’ve made a few arrangements, and… (shaky breath) it’s going to be okay. Honestly. I think it is. I – I can’t be a part of this anymore and if this is the price, then I think I’m okay to pay it.

(inhale) It’s – it’s the rest of you I’m worried about.

ARCHIVIST
We’ll be fine. Always have been.

MELANIE
(scoffs lightly) Not always.

ARCHIVIST
No, I guess not.

…well, if you’re sure.

MELANIE
I won’t be around after this, but I’ll leave details in case you need to get in touch, um, but…

ARCHIVIST
I understand.

How are you planning on doing it?

MELANIE
Got, uh, got one of those awls from the book repair suppliers, up in the library? (shakily) If it can punch through books it can punch through, uh… Well it – it should do the trick. No reason to try and make it too complicated.

ARCHIVIST
I – I suppose not.

MELANIE
I’ve left a proper resignation letter on Lukas’s desk. It was quite satisfying to write, actually. Almost made me wish it was Elias. He would have hated me not serving out my two weeks notice, heh. Not sure Lukas even knows who I am… probably for the best.

ARCHIVIST
We’ll miss you.

MELANIE
(wryly) Wish I could say the same.

ARCHIVIST
(quietly) Yeah. Do you need any, uh… help?

MELANIE
(deep breath) No. I’ve got this. But if you, um… If you could…

In five minutes, I would appreciate it if you could call me an ambulance.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[Rustling of paper. In the background, the clock ticks.]
MARTIN
Mm? (beat) Oh.

[He laughs, gently.]
MARTIN
Yeah. (rustling paper) I was going to read one. Hate for you to miss it!

[Short, forced laugh, as he flaps the statement around.]
MARTIN
You know, I- I’ve been wondering about your batteries. Like, could I just take the batteries out each time one of you appears, and just- have an infinite supply of batteries? I mean- I won’t; don’t worry, don’t really have anything that needs them these days.

Also, I know there’s every chance that you don’t even have any, and it’s just empty, and, well… I’m not really sure that’s something I want to confirm.

Or, I open up your compartment and it’s like- meat, or maggots, or something. (slight pause, contemplative) Mm.

Emptiness or maggots. (he exhales) It’s kinda the shape of things around here, isn’t it?

Still, kind of nice to talk to some…thing? (sigh as he speaks) It’s always quiet, these days. For me, at least.

I guess I technically have the power to make it not quiet, to, to talk to people, but like- you know, I, I also have the power to clean out the fridge, and it’s still a mess. It’s not that I don’t want to clean the fridge, it’s just-

Some things are just hard.

Anyway. I know he’s been listening to the tapes, so I guess that’ll have to do.

I think I still care that he hears my voice. It’s hard to tell, sometimes. How much do I actually care, and how much is just feeling that I should care?

I’m on my own so much these days, I…

Just wish I didn’t like it so much.

I mean, if you’ve got any thoughts, I’d love to hear them.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
Hmm?

[Silence, but for the clock.]
MARTIN
No. Didn’t think so. (long inhale) That’s not what you’re here for, is it? (exhale-sigh) No. You want this.

[He holds up the statement.]
MARTIN
Fine. (heavy inhale-exhale) Fine. Have it your way.

[He sounds resigned, like he was hoping for some insight during this ‘conversation’ that never came.]
MARTIN
As usual. (pause) Martin Blackwood, assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute, recording statement #0090401. Statement of Adelard Dekker, taken from a letter to Gertrude Robinson, dated 4th of January, 2009.

Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
(inhale) Gertrude. I wanted your opinion on an encounter I’ve had described to me, and given your recent dealing with Viscera, I would very much value your input.

Good job on that, by the way. I’m sure the gnostic temple was a great loss culturally speaking, but I can’t help but admire your directness when it comes to this sort of thing. I often find myself locked in a sense of esoteric paralysis on how to proceed.

Still. God grant me clarity to act when I need it.

Anyway, I was following up on a young man who had apparently had a nasty experience whilst exploring the ruins of the Bright Lake amusement park in Colorado.

You will forgive me if I withhold his name, as I have all the verification I need to be sure he’s telling the truth, and I find it hard to believe any followup you would be interested in doing would be beneficial for him. He’s earned his anonymity.

Bright Lake lies to the north of White River National Forest, just off the I-70. It was built in the sixties, around a large artificial lake that was apparently formed following a mining accident that had collapsed a significant portion of the surrounding landscape.

It was, from what I can tell from a collection of photos taken in 1983, a largely unremarkable amusement park. A medium sized wooden roller coaster, a ferris wheel, a Hall of Mirrors, and a wide avenue of games and carnival booths, as well as a fleet of paddle boats that allowed you to go out into the lake that gave the place its name.

By the nineties, it was struggling. By the turn of the millenium, it was out of business, closing its gates for the last time in October 1999.

From what I understand, there have been several plans to rebuild it or repurpose the land in the decades since, but none have amounted to more than surveyors pocketing fees and many slabs of planning documentation tucked away in filing cabinets.

It’s a little too out-of-the-way to be a common destination for teenage delinquency, but has become, I’m told, quite popular with what can be described as ‘rural urban exploration groups.’

Apparently, the lack of, well, actual urban areas to explore means that locations such as this become quite a draw for those in the area with an interest in abandoned places. And of course, its rather forbidding appearance after ten years of decay has led quite a few ghost hunters out that way, as well, though I’m not aware of any specific tragedies or stories about it that would give them much to go on.

My young friend was specifically intending to use it as the site of a party they were planning to throw. Based on his description, I would have called it a rave… but when I said so, he looked at me like I didn’t understand what he was talking about.

In any case, there was going to be a lot of dancing and movement, so he decided to scout ahead in order to see how structurally sound the place still was.

He was planning to mark out those buildings and areas that should be avoided, and which should be sufficiently stable to support a crowd of intoxicated party-goers.

I pressed him on how scary it had been, what fear he might have felt approaching it, but whilst he’d admit it was “creepy as hell,” that was apparently the point, and he said he didn’t feel any apprehension when he got there.

I suspect his machismo is stopping him admitting it, but there wasn’t much I could do to get him to open up.

He was very interested in the Hall of Mirrors. According to him, if it was still in good shape, it would have been an amazing place to put on a light show, and have his guests dance their way through the maze.

Sounds like a good way to get injured to me, but apparently I used the word ‘rave’ wrong, so what do I know?

Anyway, that was his first stop after checking that the wooden floor of the main avenue was still solid, which it was, and that the central square would be able to take the weight of the heavy speakers, which it could. Then, he headed to the Hall of Mirrors.

A lot of the actual mirrors themselves were cracked or broken, making the maze part of the funhouse easy to navigate, but he reckoned if he took the time to sweep up the broken glass, it would still be serviceable.

Then he came to a long, straight room that contained the warped mirrors. Now, to you and I, the undamaged pristine state of these would have a warning sign. The fact that there was no dust on them at all, even after ten years of neglect, would have rang all sorts of alarm bells.

But I’m trying to remind myself that not everyone is as attuned to these signs as we are, and to my young trespasser friend, apparently there was nothing in that to worry him at all. In fact, he was excited to see them in such a good shape.

I feel a little guilty. I actually laughed when he said that.

It was the third mirror that did it. The one that expanded him into a short, squat reflection caused no problems. Neither did the one that bent him out of shape. But the third mirror, the one that squeezed him, made him thin and gaunt, that was the one which took him.

He outright refused to tell me how exactly he was pulled through it, but from the look in his eyes I have no doubt it was a powerfully unpleasant experience, so much so, that he claims to have lost consciousness.

He awoke to bright lights, and the sound of machines whirring, cut through with ringing bells and the sound of people shouting. The lights in the Hall of Mirrors were on, and it was clear that he was no longer in the old amusement park, seeing the place was changed from how he recalled it in the dark.

Everything seemed more or less maintained, with paint that was old and starting to peel, but a long way from the bare, rotten wood it had been before. The only thing in worse condition were the mirrors themselves, the frames of which were now pocked with tiny, irregular indentations all the way round.

It would be some time before the idea would come to him that they were teeth marks.

Our witness staggered to his feet and quietly made his way towards the door of the funhouse, hanging off the side, so as to look out without being seen.

The park was completely changed, now seemingly full of life. There were people striding down the main avenue, past the well-lit booths trying to entice them with coconut throws and hoop games. The rollercoaster rattled along in the background, the faint screams of its riders drifting over the crowds below. For a few seconds it seemed almost legitimately joyful.

But as he watched, a certain wrongness began to become clear. Meaningless details, if they were confined to a single punter, but all the park-goers seemed the same.

The first was how baggy their clothes were. It almost seemed as though everyone was wearing some sort of oversized novelty tshirt. But it was the same with the shirts, jackets, dresses- until it became apparent that it was not the clothes that were too big, but the wearers who were too small.

Their limbs were painfully thin to look at, their flesh stretched tightly over jutting bones, and the fabric hung off them like great flaps of skin. The hair on each head was thin, almost wispy, often missing in great chunks, and their eyes were sunken so hollow that from a distance they seemed empty.

This is when our unfortunate interloper began to feel the first stirrings of fear.

He began to move, slowly and quietly, outside, his utter bafflement at what was happening briefly overpowering his mounting dread. It wasn’t just a few of them. Everyone in the park was so emaciated that they barely seemed human- but they seemed to be acting normally, at least for the moment.

He moved slowly through the shadows of the rickety wooden structures, watching them pass, until his eyes fell upon the coconut shy.

‘WIN BREAD,’ the sign announced in bold colors, but a huge black cross had been struck through it, and from this distance the prize bucket seemed empty.

Even so, a woman stood there, hurling a well-worn leather ball at the hairy targets in the back. As she knocked one from its perch, her face contorted into a grimace of joy, and the wizened carnie hobbled over to one of the buckets and handed her a tiny bone.

Without hesitation, she snapped it cleanly in half and started desperately gnawing at the broken end, trying to reach whatever scant marrow might have remained inside.

Our lost young friend felt his stomach turn. He told me he was a good fifteen feet away, but could still hear the sounds of her desperate hunger over the rides all around.

The woman began to examine the bone in her hand closely, then turned and began railing at the carnie, accusing him of cheating her, of lying about the prizes.

This was all too much for our witness, who had decided that whatever was going on in this place, he wanted no part of it. But as he turned to look for a way out, there was a sound that cut through the background din of the park: It was a scream from the roller coaster, but not the joyful cry of adrenaline and mock terror, but a dreadful, piercing wail, flying through the air.

It seemed one of the riders, unable to properly benefit from the safety bar, had been thrown from the height of a loop, and was sailing through the air, landing on the unforgiving ground of the main avenue with a horrendous crunch.

A sudden silence fell over the place. The rides still whirred and rang and jangled, but every person there had gone completely still, their eyes locked on the mangled mess of broken limbs and shattered bone.

It was the carnie that went first, vaulting over the side of the coconut shy with an unexpected agility. Then it was as if a dam had broken, and every half-wasted figure descended on the twisted corpse. Our interloper had to look away, or risk being sick at the sight of so many spindly bodies swarming, biting, rotten teeth and swollen gums tearing at the still-twitching body of the unfortunate soul from the roller coaster.

When he told me of the hunger he saw in their eyes, his legs were shaking so badly, he had to turn away.

His eyes fell instead on the coconut shy, and he finally got a good look at what were propped up as targets.

What stared back at him certainly had hair, but they most definitely were not coconuts.

He staggered backwards as a shock passed through him, colliding with a nearby trash can and sending it clattering to the floor. He tried to regain his footing, but something underneath him rolled away, and he slipped, falling on top of the heap of bones from the overturned garbage.

They were too large to be animal bones, he was sure of it, and every one of them had been picked clean and cracked open, the marrow sucked from them to leave nothing but dry, white fragments.

Pulling himself painfully to his feet, he glanced back at the crowd, and saw that several of them on the edge, those that had no hopes of reaching the corpse, had clearly heard the commotion, and were starting to walk warily towards him.

He tells me he was suddenly very aware of just how much flesh was on his body.

He turned, and ran back into the funhouse.

I do envy you your gifts sometimes, Gertrude. His account of their pursuit through the mirror-maze was honestly so disjoint that I was unable to follow it. Even after he tried to take me through it two, or even three times.

Without the Eye’s clarifying influence, panic can make details… difficult to remember.

They shouted at him, certainly, but his stark terror appears to have robbed him of the memory of their words.

Judging by the bite marks on his wrist, I think it’s safe to assume that one of them caught him, at least for a moment, but he claims he can remember nothing of the sort.

I can at least say for certain that he managed to lose his pursuers long enough to return to the warped mirrors. He then took what I consider to be his only sensible action in the entire affair: Rather than running straight to the mirror which distorted him into a thin, angular figure, he took a moment to look into each one, and one of them showed no reflection at all.

His next action of running full-pelt into it was perhaps less inspired, but it does seem to have been effective, since when he regained consciousness, covered in blood and broken glass, he was once again in the silent darkness of the abandoned Bright Lake amusement park he had made the unwise decision to break into.

I don’t believe the party ever happened, which is almost certainly for the best.

So? What are your thoughts. I’m keen to hear your own interpretation of this one. My first assumption would have been the Flesh, based on the cannibalism and strangeness of the bodies involved, but- something about this idea of some sort of famine world, its location within a man-made ruin, the whole… societal aspect of it- I’d be inclined to chalk this up as a genuine Extinction manifestation.

But I don’t know. Am I drawing wild conclusions, trying to fit the account into my own preconceptions? Keen to know your feelings on the matter.

Oh. One more thing: If you do try to follow up with my source- and I know you have your own ways of finding him, should you wish- please be careful.

He told me, near the end, that he had recently been worried he’s being followed. He keeps catching glimpses of a thin figure in the distance, or disappearing around a corner, and I can’t quite get past the detail that there was no reflection at all in the mirror he used to return.

If my suspicions are correct, there’s little either of us can do for him- but do take care, if you make contact.

MARTIN
Statement ends.

[He flips the paper over, sighs.]
MARTIN
Another day, another Extinction scare. The more things change, I guess.

[He sighs again, longer this time. When he picks back up, a familiar squeaky static begins to fade in, quickly.]
MARTIN
I just wish Peter would finally get round to telling me what we’re going to do about it.

PETER
Then I have good news for you!

[Martin sucks in a hard breath, and we hear what sounds like his chair scraping backwards in alarm.]
MARTIN
(admonishing, annoyed) Peter, we have talked about this!

PETER
In my defense, it is still quite funny.

[Martin takes an annoyed breath to keep his cool.]
MARTIN
So. What’s the news?

PETER
I think we’re finally ready!

MARTIN
(through gritted teeth) Great. Does that mean I finally get to know what we’re ready for?

PETER
Yes! Well- for the most part. To a certain degree, you really need to see it for yourself.

MARTIN
Peter.

PETER
You know the tunnels under the Institute?

MARTIN
Y- Yes, I remember.

PETER
Well, there’s something at the center, a- let’s call it a device. Now, our biggest problem with the Extinction is a lack of information. We know it’s emerging, but we don’t know how, or where.

MARTIN
And this… de…vice will help?

PETER
Yes.

MARTIN
And I’m going to be the one to use it for you.

PETER
I very much hope so. (brief pause) If you need more time…

MARTIN
I don’t.

PETER
Good, because I was going to say there probably isn’t any.

MARTIN
If it’s been down there all this time, how come we haven’t found it? John explored the tunnels pretty thoroughly, and Leitner was down there a lot.

PETER
It’s very difficult to reach if you don’t know exactly where you’re going.

MARTIN
And you do?

PETER
I will. By tomorrow, I should have my hands on a map, and then- we go.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
(more subdued) Right. (beat) Will I be coming back?

PETER
You’re not going to die, if that’s what you’re asking, but- no. If all goes well, you won’t be.

[Martin takes a long inhale, then exhales.]
PETER
How does that make you feel?

[The static in the background adopts a bit more bass than usual, and the high-pitched scream-like tones increase in volume as well.]
MARTIN
Nothing. (short laugh) Nothing at all.

PETER
Excellent. I’m so proud of you, Martin.

MARTIN
I really don’t care.

PETER
Perfect.

You’re not going to die, if that’s what you’re asking, but – no. If all goes well, you won’t be.

ARCHIVIST
(exhale) This tape was left on my desk. I don’t know by who, but to my mind, there are three options. Martin has left it here to let me know that whatever the situation is with Peter Lukas, it is entering its final act, and he needs my help. Alternatively, Peter may have left here to… goad me into action? Or just to gloat, to highlight my helplessness at everything. (sigh) Or Annabelle Cane is trying to manipulate me into thinking it’s one of the other scenarios. Previously, the spiders have made their presence clear when they’ve sent me… hints… but I can’t take that for granted.

I don’t know what to do.

There’s a statement with it. It looks pretty recent. (hm) First time in a while I’ve been… wary of reading one.

Still, I guess… (deep breath)

Statement of Adelard Dekker, regarding a potential pandemic originating in the town of Klanxbüll, Germany. Original statement given 14th August, 2013. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
You must forgive me, Gertrude, for any typing and spelling errors that might be in this message. My hands are shaking quite badly and my fingers… aren’t what they were. Even so, just knowing where this is going, this statement… I can feel the Eye’s power on me, be it ever so slight. Steadying me. Helping the words flow.

[A FAINT, DISTORTED BUZZING SOUND RISES IN THE BACKGROUND.]
Is it strange that here, now, that seems almost a comfort? This is the last time you will hear from me. You must trust me on that and not come looking. Not that you would – I know you’re too smart for sentimentality, especially after what I have to tell you – but I feel it worth saying nonetheless. Perhaps I’m simply prevaricating. Trying to cling on to a few more precious minutes of life. But that’s not me. I know what awaits me, and must have no hesitation in going to my reward. I know you’ve never had much patience for my faith, but perhaps it will provide you some small peace knowing I face my death gladly, knowing I have done my duty before God.

I have spoken to you before of Christabel, my contact within the ECDC. She had a run-in with the Crawling Rot some decades ago and has since then kept me up to date with any incidents they have encountered which display… unusual properties. Well, she alerted me to what was internally believed to be a potential pandemic originating in the small town of Klanxbüll on the German-Danish border. From what I understand, it was a perfectly pleasant small town, remarkable mainly for a rail line running out to a large island off the mainland.

But as it was, it had been completely quarantined. Christabel reported that the disease seemed to be artificial or man-made in origin, and her colleagues were keen to label it as a bioweapon, but its behavior didn’t follow any normal patterns or vectors. Combined with its extremely disturbing symptoms, which caused the skin and muscles to become loose and malleable until they sloughed completely off the body, leaving only a skeleton and organs… well, she was certain that it was the product of an otherworldly evil, and called me.

I’ve spoken before about how keenly I’ve watched news of possible pandemics, which is where I suspect the Extinction may pull away from the Corruption during its emergence. This, alongside the possibility of the disease being man-made – though I am certain no human had anything to do with it – well, it was more than enough to draw me in.

I had no interest in compromising Christabel’s position, so I made my own preparations for entry, borrowing a hazmat suit from one of the tents erected around the perimeter. I always despised trying to move in those things, but it seems they’ve made some real improvements in them over the last fifteen years, so I was able to stay relatively quiet as I talked my way past the cordon and headed into infected Klanxbüll. I’m certainly glad this happened south of the border with Denmark, as my German is passable compared to my non-existent Danish.

Once inside the town, it became rapidly apparent how bad the situation truly was. You and I, Gertrude, have seen more visions of hell than anyone has a right to while living, but this was something else entirely.

Thin trails of blood and skin crisscrossed to the streets, and the walls and windows of nearby buildings were coated in a fine sheen of discarded gore. It didn’t take me long to find my first victim, wrapped around a lamppost. He had clearly tried to lean on it for support in his distress, but his flesh had begun to spread and fuse over it in thick, ropey tendrils. His bones were almost bare to the elements.

But it was then that I saw the thing that, to my mind, is perhaps the worst of it. His heart was exposed. It was beating fast, so fast, despite the awful green decay that seemed to be eating at it. I knew at that moment there was nothing that could be done to save the town. But I could, perhaps, identify the cause.

And identify it I did. I began by checking houses, looking for anything that might have been an unusual artefact or one of those dreadful books. Few doors were locked and many seemed to be swinging open in the breeze that I was deeply thankful I could not smell. Still, for all the quaint homes with their slanted roofs that I combed through, I found nothing that might qualify as an origin for the small town’s gruesome demise. But neither did I find many other victims. There were a few: a woman melted into her now crimson bed; an old man whose bright eyes still stared out of his skull, watching the television, though the rest of him lay pooled on the floor. And in all of them, the frantic beating of their decomposing hearts.

The state of these homes, however, would seem to indicate that many had begun to develop symptoms while still inside. Countertops in otherwise empty houses would be coated with blood; wooden floorboards peppered with flecks of gristle. Yet of these individuals, there seemed to be no obvious sign except a line of viscera leading towards the front door.

It was then I realized that I had been following the trails entirely the wrong way. They were not people returning home to die. The sick were pulling themselves out of their houses, crawling, dragging themselves towards some other place, leaving bits behind on the rough pavement as they did so. So I began to walk, slowly, both because of my bulky suit and the rising sense of dread in my stomach. I wonder, Gertrude, whether you are truly as fearless as you seem, or if you are simply a master of disguising your terror. I suppose I’ll never have a chance to find out. I rather hope it was the former. However much I disagree with some of your methods, it feels good to believe there are people in this world who can stare down the Devil without flinching.

I found the source of this sickness in the parkplatz opposite the train station. The cars had been pushed to the side, clearly at great cost to the bodies of those that pushed them, and in the center was a figure from whom the rot clearly flowed.

He was sat upon a most dreadful throne, formed from a dozen, two dozen bodies mixed together like putty. Eyes staring out like horror-stricken stars twinkling in the night, and their hearts beating for all to see. A moaning came from that awful seat: voices trying to scream through things that weren’t their throat. And it is a sound I shall be glad to leave behind me when I go to my rest.

I will confess to being perversely disappointed when I saw the figure sat upon it – no pale spectre in a lab coat, or twisted golem of petri dishes and test tubes. No, he was lanky, wearing an ill-fitting brown suit and a smile. I’d never previously had the misfortune to meet him, but I knew the description well enough to recognize John Amherst. So it seemed it was not the Extinction, as I had anticipated, but simply a new and awful strain of Corruption.

Still, it was not something I felt I could leave to run its course unopposed. At first I was struck almost with despair, having nothing to hand with which I might attempt a confrontation with this creature, but upon retreating some ways and considering my options, I realized I actually had almost the exact resources to hand that I might need. A few minutes spent scouting the surrounding streets even revealed a small construction site almost precisely suited to my requirements. I returned to the cordon and took what I needed: a stretcher, as many quarantine sleeves as I could carry, and a syringe. The medical staff appeared to have retreated to the large tent that served as their base of operations, and if anyone noticed me, they didn’t interfere. I loaded the gear into a wheelbarrow I had taken from the building site along with a thick metal chain, and began to head back towards the parkplatz, stopping only to fill the syringe from a can of garden pesticide I had noticed during my earlier sweep of the houses.

Finally, I revealed myself. He approached me coyly, clearly believing me to be a foolish or lost ECDC medic. Perhaps he assumed I was frozen in terror at the sight of his work, and luckily my hazmat suit did much to hide my expression. He walked up to me with a smile so wide it tore the edges of his mouth, leaking a sick green liquid from the edges, and reached a hand out for my mask.

It was then I gripped his hand and plunged the syringe into his spongy flesh, and pumped him full of the chemical cocktail. He staggered back, ripping the needle from my hand, and fell to the floor, shaking.

I had no illusions of poison being sufficient to destroy an avatar of Filth, though from what I knew of his affinity to insects, I hoped it would be at least temporarily effective. Regardless, I had to work fast. I dragged him to the stretcher and strapped him down, wrestling against his thrashing spasms. Even through the hazmat suit I could feel the diseased heat of his skin.

I wrapped him around with the chain, which would, I hoped, hold him fast, as I pulled the plastic over the stretcher in layer after layer until I could barely see him through the thick clouded material. I hadn’t brought any of the supports with me, so in the end, it looked less like the well-constructed tube of a quarantine stretcher, and more like a lumpy vinyl sack. Still, it was sealed, and that was enough for my purposes. I dragged the thing over to the building site and, with the last of my strength, threw him into the hole that had been left.

By this point, the concrete truck I’d turned on earlier had been mixing for some time, and it was a simple matter to open the pump and pour the contents of its hopper down on top of him. How much he had recovered by this time, I couldn’t say for sure, but… he certainly moved around plenty as that thick gray sludge began to cover him.

I can’t deny some pride in my solution, Gertrude. In all our discussions of how to contain a being that we could not destroy, I’m not sure we ever hit on a method quite so neat. I am no builder, but by the end I think you would have been hard-pressed to criticize how well that concrete had been laid, and Amherst four feet beneath it.

And now, the part of my tale you must have anticipated from the beginning. During the altercation, the adrenaline had kept me from noticing the tear that Amherst had made in my hazmat suit while I wrestled him onto the stretcher, but as I sat to savor my victory, it became clear that a great cut on my leg had gone clean through the material. There was no way that I was not infected, and indeed over these last few hours, I have felt the sickness working on me. My pace is sluggish and I can feel my skin begin to loosen. My heart is beating so fast it shakes my whole body.

But I shall not wait for it to putrefy as the rot overtakes me. I have dragged those other afflicted I could find into the parkplatz, laid them at the feet of that appalling throne, and taken the last gift of that generous construction site: a dozen cans of petrol. I will sit upon that seat and release these poor souls from their suffering, and hopefully make things simpler for the ECDC cleanup crews.

But it did not seem quite right to leave without letting you know what happened, and Herr Becker was kind enough to succumb to the sickness without signing out of his computer. So.

Perhaps you were right about the Extinction. I’ve been hunting it for decades now, and while I have seen evidence of its influence in other powers, I have never found anything to genuinely prove its emergence as a true power of its own. Perhaps it is an existential fear that flows through the others like a vein of ore, or perhaps the birth of such things is longer and more complicated than I believed. For all that, though, I cannot regret at the time I have spent seeking it. I have done my duty, and none may ask more of me. I am proud of the work we have done, and it has been an honor to do it alongside you.

Goodbye, Gertrude. May you find your rest where no shadows are cast, and no eyes may see you slumber.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

This, uh… this changes things. I – I think. if Martin found this, read it already, then perhaps he’s having second thoughts about – about Peter and the Extinction. This – this could be a cry for help, his way of asking me to follow him without Peter knowing, or… (sigh) or what? I don’t understand. Martin’s been quite clear he doesn’t want my help. Am I just hearing what I want to hear? I need a second opinion, but… Basira and Daisy are… out… somewhere. they left in a hurry and didn’t tell me why, now their phones are going to voicemail. Maybe they’re just on the Underground, and probably – that doesn’t help me now.

I need someone I can trust.

No, John, you’ve done enough!

ARCHIVIST
I just need to talk to –

GEORGIE
What don’t you understand? She mutilated herself to get out of that place, and there is absolutely no way I’m letting you involve her again.

ARCHIVIST
Look, is she here or not? She – she said she was staying with you.

GEORGIE
Yes, she’s here.

ARCHIVIST
Really? Where’s all her stuff?

Bedroom. Why?

ARCHIVIST
No, I just…

Oh. Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t – I didn’t realize you were to-together.

GEORGIE
That’s ‘cause it’s none of your business. Now leave.

ARCHIVIST
Please, Georgie, it’s not – I just need to know I’m not overreacting to something. I need an outside perspective.

GEORGIE
Sure, well, here’s one. Get out of my flat.

MELANIE
(softly) Oh – what’s go… what’s going on? You – you woke the Admiral.

GEORGIE

Melanie, I…

MELANIE

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. It’s me.

GEORGIE
It’s all right, Melanie.

John, leave.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry, I just… it’s Martin.

MELANIE
John… don’t. Please.

ARCHIVIST
No, you’re right, I’m sorry. You alright?

MELANIE
Yes. I’m… I’m actually doing okay.

ARCHIVIST
That’s good.

MELANIE
(wry laughter) My therapist isn’t happy about it, you know. Unsurprisingly. Tried to have me put away, but they, um… they let me come here. It’s – it’s been good for me though I feel alright. I’m – I’m not scared anymore.

GEORGIE
Melanie, you don’t have to do this.

MELANIE
It’s – it’s okay. He’s welcome… as a friend. But that’s it.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

MELANIE
But you’re not after a friend, are you, John?

ARCHIVIST
(desperately) I need an ally.

MELANIE
Then I can’t help you.

ARCHIVIST
…I suppose not.

[THE ADMIRAL MEOWS.]
GEORGIE
Okay. You’re done?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. (sighs deeply) Yeah, I am.

GEORGIE
Come on, Melanie. Let’s get you back to bed.

No. We’re not playing your game. Now don’t forget how sharp I can be, Archivist. Perhaps here, now, you’re powerful enough to learn what you want from me, but if you try, I promise you I will resist. And only one of us is going to survive the attempt.

[THE BLADE WITHDRAWS.]
ARCHIVIST
(out of breath) Fine. Can you take me there? To the center?

HELEN
I honestly don’t know. But I’m not inclined to risk it.

ARCHIVIST
Damn you!

HELEN
Run home, John. Find a victim on the way. Chaos is coming and I think you’d best be ready.

ARCHIVIST
Just tell me what’s going on. Please.

HELEN
(gleefully) Bad things, Archivist. Really bad things.

[TAPE CLICKS ON. THE SOUND OF PETER’S STATIC IS AUDIBLE IN THE BACKGROUND ALONG WITH SLOW, HEAVY FOOTSTEPS. MARTIN MAKES AN AGITATED SOUND.]
PETER
(pleasantly) Is everything alright, Martin?

MARTIN
It’s fine. Don’t particularly like it down here.

PETER
Ah, yes, of course. Hard to trust the doors, I imagine.

MARTIN
(wry chuckle) Yeah, well, everyone else seems to these days, so…

PETER
But she’s still the same corridors, I suppose. I’m sure… what was his name… Tim! Tim w–

MARTIN
(interrupting) I would really. Rather not talk about it, Peter.

PETER
Very well. This way.

[A FEW SECONDS OF SILENCE AND FOOTSTEPS.]
MARTIN
Are you sure about that map? I’m pretty certain the tunnels change.

PETER
Oh, don’t worry about that. Ink’s practically still wet. Not to mention, if they do change, well… I happen to have something that will change them back.

[RUSTLING]
MARTIN
That’s a Leitner.

PETER
It is!

MARTIN
And the, um… the blood on it?

PETER
(cheerfully) That’s Leitner too!

MARTIN
(apprehensively) …Riiight.

PETER
Do you want to see how it works?

MARTIN
No, no, I’d really rather you didn’t –

PETER
No, I insist! Watch.

[A FEW SECONDS OF SILENCE AS NOTHING HAPPENS.]
MARTIN
(wryly sarcastic) Very impressive.

PETER
I’m reading. Shush.

[MORE SILENCE, THEN FAINT FOOTSTEPS.]
MARTIN
Peter. Peter, there’s a… Peter, I think there’s something in there.

PETER
Mm-hmm. I’d stay quiet if I were you.

[A LOUD, SCRAPING SOUND GROWS IN VOLUME, ALONG WITH AGITATED, INHUMAN NOISES, BEFORE NOT-SASHA ENTERS WITH A DISTORTED SCREAM. IT LETS OUT A FEW RAGGED GASPS.]
NOT-SASHA
So you finally decided to let me out, John? (calling) Jooooohn?

Who’s there?

[MARTIN’S TERRIFIED BREATHING CAN BE HEARD.]
Who let me out?

Don’t be shy… I just want to say thank you.

…alright, have it your way. Now if you’ll excuse me… I have some unfinished business.

[IT LETS OUT A CACKLING LAUGH AS ITS VOICE FADES.]
[MARTIN LETS OUT A SHAKY BREATH.]
MARTIN
That – that – that was. Um –

PETER
Yes!

MARTIN
And it’s going to –

PETER
Make sure everyone is too busy to follow us. They’ll be fine… probably.

You could still go help them. If you insist.

[SEVERAL SECONDS OF SILENCE, MARTIN LETS OUT A RESIGNED INHALE.]
PETER
(satisfied) Very good. Come on.

ARCHIVIST
Gone how?

DAISY
Just walked, out as far as we can tell.

BASIRA
A couple of guards on duty vanished too.

ARCHIVIST
(agitated) Vanished. How?!

BASIRA
Just left. Best we can tell, he had some dirt on them.

DAISY
Old friend at the prison let us know.

ARCHIVIST
What, and no one thought of that?

BASIRA
Asshole could have left at any time, but he just sat there laughing at us.

ARCHIVIST
No, no, this – this can’t be a coincidence.

BASIRA
Coincidence with what?

ARCHIVIST
Martin, or someone, left me a tape. Him and Peter Lukas are looking for something down in the tunnels.

BASIRA
Do you know what?

ARCHIVIST
No. He called it a device.

DAISY
When?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I don’t – I mean… n-now? I guess? They could – it can’t be a coincidence that this is when Elias chooses to make a break for it.

BASIRA
You think he’s coming here?

ARCHIVIST
You don’t?

DAISY
Let’s go.

ARCHIVIST
(sighs) I’ll get the key.

[MORE CLANGING FOOTSTEPS.]
MARTIN
What is this place?

PETER
The panopticon of Millbank prison. Not quite as Smirke originally conceived it, of course; Jonah Magnus made certain… adjustments.

MARTIN
And it’s been down here the whole time?

PETER
Why’d you think this was chosen as the Institute’s location when the prison closed? It’s a significant site of power for the Beholding. From the tower in the center of this room, you can see everything.

MARTIN
But there’s nothing in the cells.

PETER
I don’t mean the cells, Martin! I mean everything. Come on. Mind your step, this comes from an era before safety rails.

MARTIN
I don’t understand. Why are we here?

PETER
It’s quite simple, really. I want to use the powers of this place to learn about the Extinction – what it’s doing, where it’s manifesting. Then we can stop it.

MARTIN
And you need me for this?

PETER
Correct! Without a connection to the Eye, any attempt to use it would likely end very messily indeed. But thankfully it just so happens that you hold such a connection.

MARTIN
So that’s it. Both Lonely and Watching.

PETER
You must admit you’re the perfect candidate.

MARTIN
I suppose I am.

PETER
There is, of course, just one other complication? You’ll have to dispose of the current occupant.

MARTIN
Current…

[MARTIN SEES SOMETHING AND STOPS.]
(tense) Who is that?

PETER
Jonah Magnus! His body at least. Sitting here, watching. Binding it all together, growing ever older. If you want to take his place, well…

MARTIN
I’ll need to kill him.

PETER
Yes. Don’t worry, though, I brought a knife.

[THE SOUND OF ROLLING, SLIDING STONE.]
MARTIN
(shaky breath) Where are his eyes?

ELIAS
Exactly where they’ve always been, Martin.

[MARTIN LETS OUT A TREMBLING GASP.]

BASIRA
And you’re sure?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, I’m sure it wasn’t here before!

BASIRA
It’s just that there’s a lot of tapes around.

ARCHIVIST
And I don’t keep any of them with the key to the tunnels. It’s been left for me.

DAISY
And it says ‘play me’. Kind of suspicious.

BASIRA
So Elias left it.

ARCHIVIST
Or Martin, or Peter, or Annabelle!

BASIRA
Fine. Whatever. Could be a distraction.

ARCHIVIST
Only one way to find out.

BASIRA
We don’t have time for this.

DAISY
We don’t know that. We’ve no idea what sort of time frame we’re on. I say play it.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

ELIAS (JONAH)
Gertrude.

GERTRUDE
(under her breath) Damn.

ELIAS (JONAH)
Did you really think I wouldn’t notice?

GERTRUDE
I’d rather hoped you’d still be hampered with all the Dark’s business. It’s their ‘Grand Eclipse’ at the moment, isn’t it?

ELIAS (JONAH)
But I think we’ve both come to the same conclusion about that. That’s why you’re here.

GERTRUDE
Yes. Shame, really. I used to be able to torch a building in half the time. Age catches us all. (contemptuously) Well, almost all of us, Elias.

ELIAS (JONAH)
You were the one so… insistent on staying human.

GERTRUDE
And no doubt that makes my death a lot less complicated.

ELIAS (JONAH)
What exactly were you hoping to achieve here? Why not come at me directly instead of burning everything first?

GERTRUDE
I was rather hoping the fire would occupy you while I did just that.

ELIAS (JONAH)
I see.

How long have you known?

GERTRUDE
About your body? Not long after you took your new host and we had our little… chat. It wasn’t exactly a huge leap to the panopticon after that. The hard part was figuring out how to actually reach it. Took me the better part of a decade.

ELIAS (JONAH)
So you burn the place down, use it as cover to reach my body, and then we die together. How poetic. Doesn’t seem like your style at all.

GERTRUDE
I wasn’t actually planning on dying.

ELIAS (JONAH)
And how exactly were you planning on achieving that while you’re still bound to the… ha. Oh, I see. Very clever. (amused smirk) I thought Eric was the only one to figure that little morsel out.

GERTRUDE
Knowledge has a way of surviving. You of all people should know that.

ELIAS (JONAH)
Quite. It was a good plan, actually. If you hadn’t been so complacent about me keeping an eye out down here, probably would have worked. (sarcastic) Gertrude’s grand retirement.

GERTRUDE
It still might.

[SOUND OF FLINT AND STEEL]
Just needs a little spark, and –

[A GUN COCKS.]
I see. So you’re finally getting your hands dirty? I must really have caught you off guard.

ELIAS (JONAH)
I suppose we both got a little complacent. Fifty years is a long time. End of an era.

GERTRUDE
I’m not really in the mood for nostalgia, Elias. You might have noticed I’m rather busy so either shoot me or –

(gasping) Well… there it is. Thought it would hurt more.

ELIAS
(sighs) Pity.

BASIRA
Right, so what does that tell us?

John? John?

ARCHIVIST
Y-yes, sorry, right. Just, uh… uh, the panopticon. It’s the, um-

BASIRA
The design of Milbank prison, based on an all-seeing watchtower. I know. I did the reading.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
You think that’s the device?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. And I’d wager that Elias’ body –

BASIRA
Gotta be Jonah Magnus, right?

ARCHIVIST
I’d say so.

BASIRA
(sigh) And he’s been body hopping like whatever was in Reynor.

ARCHIVIST
So is he going to help Peter or stop him?

BASIRA
Lukas is planning to take over the panopticon. Can’t imagine he wants that to happen.

ARCHIVIST
But Elias put him in charge. That doesn’t make any- what… Daisy are you-?

BASIRA
Shh!

What are you doing here, Elias?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Oh, you needn’t worry.

ELIAS (JONAH)
I couldn’t stop you if I wanted to. I just wanted to be here at the end. Can a man not watch his own death?

MARTIN
What, wh- what? What? How are you even here?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Well-

PETER
Don’t let him distract you.

ELIAS (JONAH)
(contemptuous) Peter.

PETER
(equally contemptuous) Elias.

MARTIN
Both of you just – just shut up. Just give me a second to think.

PETER
Of course. You can take all the time in the world.

ELIAS (JONAH)
Come now, Martin. I would have thought you’d jump at the chance to kill me.

MARTIN
That’s not… why wouldn’t you help against the Extinction?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Because I’m a busy man. It has never been my top priority.

MARTIN
I don’t believe you.

ELIAS (JONAH)
That really doesn’t matter, I’m afraid. It’s the only answer you’re going to get.

MARTIN
If I…

If I do kill you, will the others survive?

PETER
Elias?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Come now, Peter, it’s a valid question. And you should have addressed it yourself, really.

The short answer is, I don’t know, Martin. I guarantee it won’t be pleasant for them, but I honestly don’t know if their ties to the Institute are quite as strong as I may have implied. You, at least should be insulated from the fallout by your new allegiance. John… might be powerful enough to weather it. Melanie’s well out of it, so that just leaves Basira and Daisy. And the rest of the Institute, of course, and you can’t tell me you care about them.

MARTIN
(indignant) Wh- of course I do!

ELIAS (JONAH)
Do you though? Do you really care about any of them? Or is that worrying just simply an old reflex?

Goodness. Peter has done his work well, hasn’t he? No, the only choice I think that matters is whether you want to kill me or not.

MARTIN
I do. (laughs) I really, really do.

PETER
Then do it, Martin. We’re the same, you and I. We don’t need anyone else. watching from a distance, that’s always who you’ve been. Haven’t you enjoyed it these last few months, drifting through the Archives unseen, unjudged? You’ll like it in there. I promise.

MARTIN
Yeah. Yeah, I think I would.

PETER
Then do it. Kill him and help me save the world.

MARTIN
No.

BASIRA
Looks like two people. An old guy and-

A woman with a scar.

It’s probably not a coincidence. From what I saw they’ve been toying with the rest of the Institute, but it won’t be long until they’re all dead or escaped.

DAISY
And then they’re coming here.

ARCHIVIST
(under his breath) Right.

BASIRA
Set up by the door. Try and take them when they break through.

DAISY
Right.

ARCHIVIST
Do I, uh… do I get a gun?

BASIRA
You’ve fired one?

You never asked. Besides, we’ve got problems enough without –

TREVOR

ARCHIVIST
You remember what happened to Sasha?

BASIRA
That’s the thing that took her.

ARCHIVIST
It was trapped in the tunnels. It – Martin. Something’s happening down there.

BASIRA
If he’s down there with Peter, or Elias… dammit, we need to get down there.

TREVOR
(in the background) Come out, come out, wherever you are!

JULIA
Ugh. Hard to tell over the stink of that thing!

BASIRA
No. No, Daisy, we’ll figure something out.

These last few months… it was always borrowed time, wasn’t it? Can’t outrun it forever.

Martin. What are you doing?

MARTIN
I’m… saying no. I refuse. Game over.

[THE KNIFE CLATTERS TO THE GROUND.]
PETER
Martin, this is not the time for petulance. There are bigger things at stake here –

MARTIN
(laugh) You know, I think that was actually the problem. You made the stakes too high. All the little details that didn’t add up… it made them more obvious. Exaggerated.

PETER
The Extinction is coming.

MARTIN
Oh, I’m sure it is! But that’s not what this is about, is it? This isn’t about saving the world, it’s all just some power play against him. I might not know exactly what’s going on, but I don’t think I want any part of this. However much I want to kill him… I’m out.

PETER
But you said –

MARTIN
Honestly, I mostly just said what I thought you wanted to hear.

PETER
I see. (to Elias) This is your doing, is it?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Hardly.

MARTIN
It’s not him! It’s not anybody. It’s just me. Always has been. I…

When I first came to you, I thought I had lost everything. John was dead, my mother was dead, the job I had put everything into trapped me into spreading evil and I… I really didn’t care what happened to me. I told myself I was trying to protect the others, but… honestly we didn’t even like each other. Maybe I just thought joining up with you would be a good way to get killed.

And then… John came back, and… and suddenly I had a reason I had to keep your attention on me. Make you feel in control so you didn’t take it out on him. And if that meant drifting further away, so what? I’d already grieved for him. And if it meant now saving him, it was worth it.

When you started talking about the Extinction, though… you had me actually, then, for a while. But then – (laughs sardonically) then, you tried to make me the hero. Tried to sell me on the idea that I was the only one who could stop it. And that I’ve never sat right with me. I mean, I mean, look – look at me, I’m not exactly a – a chosen one. But by then I was in too deep. So I played along. Waited to see what your end game was, and here we are.

Funny. Looks like I was right the first time. It’s probably still a good way to get killed?

ELIAS (JONAS)
(smugly) I warned you, Peter.

PETER
But you do serve the Lonely.

MARTIN
Oh, I’m getting there, but if this is the final test or something? Then bad luck. The answer’s still no.

PETER
(petulantly) No. No! This isn’t fair – do you have any idea what you’ve done? You knew, he must realize –

MARTIN
Jonah had nothing to do with it.

PETER
No, that’s not – you can’t –

ELIAS (JONAH)
You’ve lost, Peter, admit it. He played you like a… (gleefully) like a… cheap whistle.

PETER
No! Shut up.

ELIAS (JONAH)
Peter. It’s time.

PETER
Fine.

MARTIN
Great. Now perhaps one of you, then, can tell me what’s…

[PETER’S TELLTALE STATIC FADES IN SUDDENLY, DROWNING OUT MARTIN’S VOICE. WHEN IT FADES OUT, MARTIN IS GONE.]
ELIAS (JONAH)
It won’t be that bad, Peter. You’ll see. Now, he’ll be here soon, so you can leave or –

PETER
Oh, no. No. I’m not gonna make it easy on him. You haven’t won yet.

ARCHIVIST
(out of breath) Yes. Yes, I did.

…how?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Suffice it to say I called you.

ARCHIVIST
What is this place?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Hmm. A complicated question. And time is as –

ARCHIVIST
The panopticon.

ELIAS (JONAH)
(pleased) …my, you have grown. Yes. A masterpiece, isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. It is. And that’s you there? Your… body?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Not anymore. But not really, although if you harmed it, it wouldn’t go well for me. Or any of your friends, for that matter.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe it’s worth it.

ELIAS (JONAH)
Maybe. And I’m sure in another circumstance, you would be more than happy to take your chances for a shot at revenge.

But…

ELIAS (JONAH)
But for Martin, time is very much of the essence.

ARCHIVIST
Where is he?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Peter Lukas has cast him into the Lonely, and with every passing moment he gets further away from you.

ARCHIVIST
How do I bring him back?

ELIAS (JONAH)
From out here? Impossible.

ARCHIVIST
You want me to follow him?

ELIAS (JONAH)
No, John. You want you to follow him. I simply want you to know that if you do so, you are almost certainly not coming back. To go into the Lonely willingly is as good as death.

[THERE IS NO HESITATION.]
ARCHIVIST
How do I do it?

ELIAS (JONAH)
Wasn’t too long ago. And I’m sure traces of their passage still remain. Just open your mind. Drink it all in. Know their route, and simply… follow it.

PETER
You’ve still got time, Archivist. Turn around and leave. You’ve played your part. Now go.

What’s wrong, Lukas? Afraid of talking face-to-face?

PETER
(chuckles) Of course. Or haven’t you been paying attention?

[THE ARCHIVIST MAKES AN AGITATED SOUND. FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin!

PETER
It’s odd, really. You each think you’re so focused on the other, but how much do you really know each other? How much time have you spent together when not working, or bickering, or fleeing from that latest thing that wants to kill you?

So. What are you seeking? The image you’ve each created of the other?

The people you think you love don’t exist. Not really. And that’s a very lonely place to be.

ARCHIVIST
(cutting off Peter’s echo) Shut up!

Martin!

PETER
(smugly) He doesn’t… want… to see you.

ARCHIVIST
Then let me hear that from him.

PETER
Just go.

ARCHIVIST
Make me.

Unless you can’t. The Lonely and the Eye aren’t too far apart, are they? Not really. What good’s being alone if you don’t know how alone you truly are?

Which means… well, I think you’re worried. You know I’ll find him eventually, and you know I can find you.

[SEVERAL SECONDS OF SILENCE]
Hm. Thought so.

Why?

MARTIN
Are you real?

ARCHIVIST
Yes! Yes, I-I-I am. Come on, we’ve got to get out of here.

MARTIN
No. No, I don’t think so.

MARTIN’S ECHO
No, I don’t think so.

ARCHIVIST
(aghast) Why?

MARTIN

ARCHIVIST

MARTIN
Nothing hurts here. It’s just quiet. Even the fear is gentle here.

ARCHIVIST
This isn’t right. This isn’t you.

MARTIN
It is, though.

(wry laugh) I really loved you, you know?

ARCHIVIST
Obviously he’s done something. Peter’s done something to mess with you–

Damn it! Martin! Martin!

PETER
(echoing) I tried to tell you. He’s gone. He made his choice. And it wasn’t you.

ARCHIVIST
It was for me, though. I’m the reason he… I did this to him as much as you.

PETER
Yes. I suppose you did.

Where are your friends, Archivist?

ARCHIVIST
Tim and Sasha are dead.

PETER
Yes?

ARCHIVIST
Daisy and Basira are… probably dead.

PETER
Because. Of. You.

ARCHIVIST
Georgie and Melanie have left me.

PETER
And?

ARCHIVIST
Martin’s gone.

PETER
You’re alone, Archivist. The last one standing. I did warn you. I did want you to leave, but… perhaps it would be better if you stayed a while. After all – you can’t hurt anyone in here.

ARCHIVIST
(seemingly defeated) Yes.

PETER (AS THE ARCHIVIST’S ECHO)
Yes.

ARCHIVIST
(flatly) Or perhaps you could answer some questions.

PETER
(echoing) …what?

[STATIC RISES AND DEEPENS AS THE ARCHIVIST SPEAKS]
ARCHIVIST
I wouldn’t try to leave if I were you. I can see you now. I can find you wherever you go.

PETER
(echo gone) Fine! It was just a thought. So leave.

Not before I get some answers.

PETER
That’s not going to happen.

ARCHIVIST
Tell me your story, Peter Lukas.

[AS THE ARCHIVIST SPEAKS, THE CRACKLING STATIC OF COMPULSION RISES.]
PETER
No!

ARCHIVIST
Tell me.

[PETER LETS OUT A FEW LONG, PAINED GROANS.]
PETER (STATEMENT)
(angrily) Fine!

Fine.

Where do you want to begin? The start? A lonely youth, my gradual path to becoming an only child?

That’s the thing, you see, about a family faith. You’ve got to double down on the believers.

My mother had five children over her life, before my father finally drifted away. She was a Lukas to the core, though not born into the family, while my father, for all he believed himself keen on a “life without obligation,” gradually withered away to nothing as she cultivated the space between them.

The house was sprawling. Our bedrooms were kept as far apart as possible, and changed often, as we were cared for by a rotating cast of nannies and tutors.

You know, she’s still alive? But I still can’t picture my mother’s face with any clarity. And I consider that a blessing. I’m not even burdened by hatred for her: she is simply someone who exists, far away from me. It was the sort of childhood that would not be allowed if we didn’t have money, but we’re an old family with, shall we say, a (heh) remarkably direct line of inheritance. The sort of family where no social worker would even be allowed on the property.

But for all that, aside from a few oddities of faith, I don’t know how different my upbringing was from other scions of aristocracy. (heh) From what I understand, severing the connection to your humanity is a cornerstone of an upper-class education… though I was spared the targeted traumas of boarding school, as my mother clearly believed the danger of friendship was too acute.

I suppose to call myself an “only child” is, technically, untrue. Two of my sisters still live, though they disavowed the family and moved far, far away. Still… to be cut off from one’s family is its own very special sort of loneliness, isn’t it? So we all serve, in our own ways.

The other two – my brother, Aaron, and sister, Judith – well, they weren’t considerate enough to quietly grow to adulthood and disappear. They simply didn’t have the temperament to thrive in the Lukas household, always trying to… instigate games. Make friends. (faint disgust) Connect with people.

As far as I’m aware, they were sent away to live their lives with very distant relatives, never to return. I’m sure it’s possible my mother resolved the matter in a less-pleasant manner, but in my limited interaction with her, she never struck me as a cruel woman, and I would imagine, for children that age, the fear and isolation of being uprooted and sent away is just as strong as that of meeting a more… grisly fate.

I, of course, was the favored son, being quiet and reserved, and, at all points, deeply engaged with my own loneliness. I had no time for books or television, or any of the escapes and artificial friendships of fiction. No, I was myself, and that was enough. I would spend my days exploring the wide grounds and forests of our estate, finding the hidden corners I thought that none would have found before me – though now, I wonder how many generations of Lukases had exactly those thoughts, in exactly those spots.

As soon as I was old enough, I would run away for days at a time. I would take what money I needed from my mother’s purse, and hitchhike to any city I could reach. Looking back, I realize how odd it was that her purse was always so full of cash, and I believe it may have been the closest thing I ever received to her blessing.

By the time I arrived at whatever destination I had arbitrarily picked, it would usually be night. I would walk around the darkened streets, drinking in the sodium orange, looking at the lit windows of the tower blocks that surrounded me, each one a small, cozy den of warmth and humanity, and reveling in my distance from them.

Sometimes, I would pass another late-night traveler on the street, and I would hate them. They shattered the distance, my cocoon of quiet stillness, and I wished with all my heart that they would simply disappear.

And one day… one of them did.

I still remember him well. He was tall and broad, wearing a green raincoat he clearly bought before middle age began to set in. There was a thin drizzle that night, one of those rains you can’t see, but leaves everything glistening and damp, and he was struggling with an umbrella. I tried to pass him quickly, but his eyes met mine and he… (disgusted) smiled. And asked if I could help him.

I can’t describe the feeling that passed through me. I can only say that I told him to go away. And he did.

Or perhaps… I did. In retrospect, it’s hard to be sure which of us fell out of the populated world, but either way, the sense of blissful relief, edged with a strange, creeping fear – it was something I’d never experienced before. It was intoxicating.

When I returned, I was met by my mother, and a small group of stern-faced relatives that I had never seen before – except at funerals. They took me below the house, and showed me the truth of our family. It was… difficult to accept, at first. Not because I didn’t want it to be true, but because it seemed unbelievable that any god could be so perfectly in tune with my heart.

I left the house again shortly after and took to the sea, and never saw my mother again – except, of course, at funerals.

Some of my most peaceful memories were on the Tundra. I had gathered a small group of trusted souls who I knew were loyal and dedicated to… my money. They had no qualms or morals about what we did on that boat, and at my request, each signed to the ship under a false name, so I would never have to know who they were. Those lonely nights of sacrifice and waiting, hearing the dreadful sound of my ancestors’ whistle drift over the dark and brooding waters, knowing another soul was leaving this world…

God, I wish I was there now. Locked in my cabin, staring over the quiet emptiness of the open ocean.

But it’s moored now, and I came on land, at (angry) Elias’s request. My crew is out there, waiting for a call I think I am now unlikely ever to give them.

I will call him “Elias,” for that’s how I’ve known him for most of our… acquaintance, though I originally met him when he was still James Wright, Head of the Magnus Institute. I considered him a dull little man at first, so keen to watch other people’s misery, to lose himself in secondhand pain and drama – exactly the sort of thing I’d always been so keen to avoid.

Gertrude was the one that scared me. She seemed to have no interest in meeting me whatsoever, something I appreciated, but there was something in her eyes when she looked at me. As though she was making a calculation, and I was an unwanted integer she was deciding whether to remove. It wasn’t until much later that I realized exactly how true that was. Still, it seems I was never a pressing-enough concern for her to sail out after me – or even wait until I made port and waylay me. I suppose even she couldn’t have predicted how it would all turn out.

Thinking about it now, perhaps one of the reasons I lasted as long as I did was that I was, at the end of the day, predictable. A known quantity. I had my little patch, sending my poor, lost sailors to their forsaken end, but I rarely stepped outside of it. When I think of all those I met who traveled in this secret world we found ourselves in – Gertrude, Simon, Mikael, even Rayner – there are plenty whose lives might well have been easier with my death, but it was rare that I strayed outside my habits.

Maybe that’s why, when I crossed paths with (slight disapproval) Adelard Dekker, we ended up talking and he told me his theory of the Extinction – something that stayed with me even after he died pursuing it.

The thing is, the loneliness I crave, that fills my heart with that reassuring unease, relies on distance from other people. But a world without people at all, or at least anything I would recognize as people…? It is meaningless. Without the lighted window in the distance, how am I to see myself apart from it? No. Such a world would be terribly dull, and scares me in a very different way. A fear I am happy to offer up, of course, but one that I would prefer not come to pass.

My instinct was much like the others: I thought that if I could complete my ritual first, then the potential birth of the dreadful change would be meaningless. I started it shortly before Simon convinced me to join him with his little space experiment. It was interesting, of course, but in the end a tremendous waste of money, just to scare a single astronaut. But I had it in my mind that it might distract from my true attempt.

I had commissioned the services of architects, designers, and sociologists, all under a variety of pretenses, and had secured a plot of land near Aldgate East. I was going to build a tower block of my very own. Oh, it was a marvel of design! Deceptively-spacious apartments, yet no room quite big enough for a double bed or decent-sized sofa. Cooking facilities that seemed adequate until you tried to do more than microwave. An office space in every flat, but without a door, so you could never truly escape your work. None of them had more than a single bedroom – though each had a main bathroom and an ensuite, which is a small touch I was very proud of.

The lower four levels were left deliberately empty, so anyone living there could only see the people below from a distance – the lights of the city that they were removed from. The windows were thick, and every wall had soundproofing inside it. The corridors were full of false doors, so even though each floor was designed to minimize the probability of residents encountering each other, it would seem as though they were crowded in by doors that would not open if knocked on. I made the elevators very small.

Then, I offered the rooms at a ridiculously low price for their central London location, and then screened the applicants mercilessly. I prioritized those who were newly moved to the city: graduates who needed cheap accommodation, and were moving into intense and high-stress jobs that would give them little time for socialising. Recent divorcees were also very suitable, especially those whose friends had sided with their partner. I crammed them in, pushing them to stew in a cocktail of distant lights, empty corridors, and lukewarm takeout for one.

The plan was to wait until those inside reached a critical mass of loneliness and despair, then all at once, lock them in remotely. Cut off their internet and phone lines, and leave them to die, alone, in their Single-Occupancy Professional Dooms as the Forsaken emerged from their terror. I called it the Silence – though to be honest, it was mainly because I thought they had to have names. Can’t say if the title was desperately inspired.

(resigned) Then – of course – Gertrude Robinson happened. Do you know how she did it? What devastating weapon she used to derail my plan? The newspaper. She tipped off someone in The Guardian.

I still remember seeing the headline, there in black and white: “The Loneliest Building in Britain.” Trouble is, everyone I picked was white middle-class, so people actually cared, falling over themselves to declare it “emblematic of the problems of the modern world.” (ugh) The thinkpieces started to pour in, the applications started to drop off, and I was up to my neck in (exasperated) community outreach programs. No way to salvage it. Years of my life and a sizable fortune down the drain. She didn’t even have the decency to kill me.

It really knocked me back. Took me years to find myself again. I returned to the Tundra, tried to forget – but the trouble was, I’d tasted the game now. I was still hungry for more. I suppose that’s why I was so keen when Elias contacted me. We’d kept in touch, of course: my family helped fund the Institute, and he’d always been good about tipping me off to potential victims. Going through something horrific can leave you feeling very isolated indeed, especially if you know no one else will believe you.

And of course… he knew I find it hard to resist a wager.

If I could convince one of his staff to willingly pledge themselves to the Lonely, it was all mine. He even let me pick the victim. He was so sure the price of the Institute, the Panopticon and a willing vessel to use it would be just too much for me to resist. And… he was right. Just didn’t go quite as I’d hoped.

You know, this is one of the first bets I ever made with him I’ve actually lost. But I guess that’s how hustlers work, isn’t it? They lose and lose until you’re willing to put it all on the line, and then – the trap shuts.

So I suppose that’s probably why I reacted so rashly, trying to rip his victory away. Keep you here. But it looks like I might have underestimated my opponent once again.

ARCHIVIST
What was his prize? What did he get if you lost?

PETER
(disinterested) Oh, he got you.

ARCHIVIST
I-I don’t understand.

PETER
And you won’t. Not from me.

I’m done.

ARCHIVIST
Tell me.

[THE COMPULSION STARTS UP AGAIN.]
PETER
(pained) I’m… not saying… another… word.

ARCHIVIST
Tell me, or I will rip it out of you.

PETER
No…

[THE STATIC GROWS LOUDER.]
ARCHIVIST
Answer my question!

PETER
(echoing again) No! Leave… me… ALONE!

ARCHIVIST
TELL ME!

[THE SQUEALING CRESCENDOS AS THE ARCHIVIST RIPS PETER LUKAS APART. LUKAS LETS OUT A FINAL DEFIANT SCREAM THAT FADES INTO THE REGULAR STATIC.]
ARCHIVIST
(whispered) Stubborn fool.

[A FEW SECONDS PASS, FOOTSTEPS]
Martin. He’s gone, Martin. He – he’s gone.

MARTIN
(echoing) His only wish was to die alone.

ARCHIVIST
Tough. Now – listen to me, Martin. Listen.

MARTIN
(emptily, echoing) Hello, John.

ARCHIVIST
Listen, I know you think you want to be here, I know you think it’s safer, and well – well, maybe it is. But we need you. (desperately) I need you.

MARTIN
No, you don’t. Not really. Everyone’s alone, but we all survive.

ARCHIVIST
(cutting off Martin’s echo) I don’t just want to survive!

MARTIN
I’m sorry.

ARCHIVIST
Martin. Martin, look at me. Look at me and tell me what you see.

MARTIN
I see…

[MARTIN’S VOICE QUAVERS.]
I see you, John.

[HE LETS OUT AN INCREDULOUS CHUCKLE, THEN ANOTHER. HIS ECHO GOES AWAY.]
I see you.

ARCHIVIST
(relieved) Martin.

[MARTIN’S BREATHING GETS FASTER. HE SOBS, HIS VOICE BREAKING.]
MARTIN
I… I was on my own. I was all on my own.

ARCHIVIST
Not anymore. Come on. Let’s go home.

MARTIN
How?

ARCHIVIST
Don’t worry. I know the way.

[THEY BEGIN TO WALK, AND THE TAPE ENDS.]
[CLICK]
[INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Knocking sound – seems like it’s Martin on the doorframe, or something being unpacked.]
MARTIN
Everything alright?

ARCHIVIST
Just – Making sure it works.

MARTIN
I still don’t think we should have brought it.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, it’s better than no warning at all. (small sigh) Especially if I’m trying not to, uh… See things, you know?

MARTIN
I guess.

[More sounds of either unpacking, or rifling through objects at a leisurely pace.]
MARTIN
You’re unpacked then?

[More unpacking sounds.]
ARCHIVIST
(familiar, warm) Hm? Oh, yes; much as I can be without any wardrobes to speak of, at least.

MARTIN
(half a laugh in his words) Yeah, it’s – it’s not exactly the Ritz.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, well, it technically still belongs to Daisy, so – (small exhale) I’m just glad it’s not some sort of kill room.

MARTIN
Or – (pause for a huffed laugh) Or it is, and she just cleaned it up really well.

[He chuckles again. The Archivist joins him.]
ARCHIVIST
(small exhale) Yes.

[He makes a small noise.]
MARTIN
Are we? –

[Sound of shuffling papers.]
MARTIN
Are we… safe here?

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Safe as anywhere. If Elias wanted to find us, I imagine he could, but – I doubt the police will be able to. If nothing else, I’m hoping there’d be some – jurisdiction complications, in Scotland?

[As he speaks, Martin sucks in a breath, as if about to speak, then cuts himself off.]
MARTIN
(that familiar sort of chuckle-scoff) Some– Somehow I don’t think Daisy will be worried about jurisdictions.

ARCHIVIST
I – (falters) I don’t think she’d come here.

[We hear him open a drawer as he continues.]
ARCHIVIST
Doesn’t look like this place has been used for years.

MARTIN
And if she does?

ARCHIVIST
(exhale) Well. At least we’ll know where she is.

MARTIN
Wh–

[He cuts himself off with a frustrated sound.]
ARCHIVIST
Besides, I’m more worried about the other Hunters. Or the – Sasha thing. Last I heard, they still hadn’t found any bodies. (long inhale) A lot of destruction, a lot of blood. (he sighs) But that’s it.

[More object sounds.]
MARTIN
You think they’re still out there?

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Hopefully a long way out there. (soft) But I think we’re okay.

[Long pause.]
ARCHIVIST
(changing-the-subject-voice, inhale) Not much in the way of food, is there?

MARTIN
Oh – Oh, no, not yet. I was actually going to go head down into the village to pick something up?

ARCHIVIST
Hm.

MARTIN
Maybe give Basira a call to check in, because Daisy apparently couldn’t pick a safehouse with a signal.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) I think that’s rather the point.

MARTIN
Mm.

ARCHIVIST
(teasing) Anyways, don’t tell me the phonebox down there doesn’t appeal to your retro aesthetic.

MARTIN
It – might. Maybe.

[He zips up a bag.]
MARTIN
You’ll be okay here?

ARCHIVIST
I’ll be fine.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE, SOME WEEKS LATER]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The air seems hollower here, and Martin’s footsteps sound like they’re coming upstairs.]
ARCHIVIST
How was she?

MARTIN
Oh, same as last week.

ARCHIVIST
Institute still crawling with police?

MARTIN
I mean, they’ve finished all the interviews? Apparently they’re calling it a “terror attack.”

ARCHIVIST
Doesn’t surprise me. (heh) Appropriate, in a way.

MARTIN
Mm.

ARCHIVIST
(carefully) Does she know who they’re looking to blame?

MARTIN
They’re not really talking to her about it? Sectioned or not, I guess ex-police only gets you so far.

ARCHIVIST
Mm.

Does she know if they’ve found the old prison yet – the Panopticon, Eli– (he catches himself, returns to the phrase with a harder edge to his voice) Magnus’s body.

MARTIN
I don’t know how hard they’re looking, to be honest?

[A thumping sound, like he’s setting his bag down on wood.]
MARTIN
Basira said a few of them got lost in the tunnels for over a day –

[The Archivist snickers in the background.]
MARTIN
– and – it’s not like the promise of an old man’s corpse is much of a motivator.

ARCHIVIST
Mm.

MARTIN
Still, she did manage to talk them out of burning the whole place to the ground? – and, ooh, actually, that reminds me, um –

[He starts pulling something out of his bag, something that crinkles like paper.]
ARCHIVIST
Ah, these, these are the statements.

MARTIN
Yes. Basira said last week she’d send some up as soon as the Archives weren’t a crime scene.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
And she wasn’t sure which ones you’ve read already, so she, she just said she’d send a bunch.

ARCHIVIST
There – There are tapes in here, as well. D-Did she say anything about tapes?

MARTIN
She didn’t mention it? – But I didn’t check it until after the call.

ARCHIVIST
Mm.

MARTIN
I assume it’s her attempt at a-a, a varied diet? Eating your greens, you know?

ARCHIVIST
(amused) Probably. (inhale, reassuring) I’m sure it’ll work fine.

MARTIN
Cool.

Well, as fun as listening to you monologue is –

ARCHIVIST
Hm.

MARTIN
– I will give you some privacy. Go for a walk.

ARCHIVIST
(exhale) Let me know if you see any good cows.

MARTIN
Obviously I’m going to tell you if I see any good cows.

[As he walks away, presumably back down the stairs, the Archivist chuckles quietly and fondly to himself.]
[Then he exhales, and as the door closes, he scrabbles at the statement on the table, getting everything in order.]
ARCHIVIST
Right. Statement of Hazel Rutter regarding a fire in her childhood home. Original statement given August 9th, 1992. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.

[We hear what’s either the crackling of paper, or a fire.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Hello, John.

[As soon as he begins speaking, a whizzing static kicks in from the background.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Apologies for the deception, but I wanted to make sure you started reading, so I thought it best not to announce myself.

I’m assuming you’re alone; you always did prefer to read your statements in private. (slightly strained) I wouldn’t try too hard to stop reading; there’s every likelihood you’ll just hurt yourself. So just listen.

Now, shall we turn the page and try again?

[The Archivist makes a pained couple of sounds out-of-statement-character, as if he’s trying to tear himself away from the statement and physically cannot.]
[When he picks the statement back up, the words sound like they’re being torn from his lips.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Statement of Jonah Magnus regarding Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.

Statement begins.

[A slap on the table – or a crack? Spooky.]
I hope you’ll forgive me the self-indulgence, but I have worked so very hard for this moment, a culmination of two centuries of work. It’s rare that you get the chance to monologue through another, and you can’t tell me you’re not curious.

Why does a man seek to destroy the world?

It’s a simple enough answer: for immortality and power. Uninspired, perhaps, but – my god. The discovery, not simply of the dark and horrible reality of the world in which you live, but that you would quite willingly doom that world and confine the billions in it to an eternity of terror and suffering, all to ensure your own happiness, to place yourself beyond pain and death and fear.

It is an awful thing to know about yourself, but the freedom, John, the freedom of it all. I have dedicated my life to handing the world to these Dread Powers all for my own gain, and I feel… nothing but satisfaction in that choice.

I am to be a king of a ruined world, and I shall never die.

I believe there are far more people in this world that would take that bargain than you would ever guess. And I have beaten all of them.

Of course, this desire did not manifest overnight. When Smirke first gathered our little band – Lukas, Scott, and the rest – to discuss and hypothesize on the nature of the things he had learned from Rayner, I felt what I believe we all felt: curiosity, and fear.

But as he compiled his taxonomy and codified his theories on the grand rituals, I began to develop a very specific concern. Smirke was so obsessed with his ideas on balance, even as our fellows began to experiment and fall to the service of our patrons.

I began to worry that if one of them successfully attempted their ritual, then I would be as much a victim as any, trapped in the nightmare landscape of a twisted world.

At first, I attempted prevention, but the cause seemed hopeless. The only way to ensure I did not suffer the tribulations of what I believed to be an inevitable transformation was to bring it about myself. So what began as an experiment soon became a race.

Beyond that, I was getting older, and mortality began to weigh more heavily on my mind. How much in this world is done because we fear death, the last and greatest terror?

I convinced Smirke to work on Millbank, leading him to design it as a temple to all the Fears in equilibrium, such that my own modifications to the design of the Panopticon went… unremarked.

It. Took. Years, for the dread of the prisoners to fully suffuse the place, and I was an old man before I made my first attempt at the Watcher’s Crown, sat in the center of that colossal eye, the great ring of cells encircling me like a coronet.

It was… flawed, of course, as all Smirke’s rituals were, and none of the inmates survived as the power I attempted to harness shook the building almost to pieces, and the murky swamp upon which the prison was built consumed it.

But it left me a gift: For sat in that watchtower, I could see everything I turned my mind to.

It was a dizzying power, and one I discovered I maintained even as I found vessels to extend my life. Of course, I had to make sure the location was kept under my control while I worked on revising my plans, and so I moved the organization I had founded to assist in my research down to London, and the Institute as you know it was born.

I’ll not bore you with details of my bodies and failures through those intervening years. Suffice to say I kept busy, both planning my own next attempt, and doing my best to stymie those others who tried versions of their own.

Surely my interpretation of the Watcher’s Crown had been incomplete; there had been some element of the ritual I had overlooked.

It was not until I met Gertrude Robinson that things began to really come into focus.

You see, the role of Archivist has been part of the Beholding for as far back as my research can go. This isn’t uncommon for the Powers; most of the beliefs around them are guesswork and fallible human interpretation, but there are certain throughlines and consistencies that can be spotted, regardless of the trappings.

But Gertrude was unlike any other Archivist. She simply did not care about compiling experiences or collecting the fears of others. She was driven to stop those who served the Powers.

More than once I thought she must secretly be of the Hunt – but there was never that sick joy in her, that thrill of predator and prey. She had simply decided that this was her position in life, and went about it with a practicality that even I found disconcerting at times.

I once asked her what drove her, what had started her down that path. She told me the Desolation had killed her cat.

I don’t know if she was joking, and, to be honest, I could never bring myself to look into her mind and find out for sure.

In any case, Gertrude’s ruthless efficiency in derailing and collapsing rituals threw into stark relief a question that had been bothering me for almost a hundred and fifty years: In the whole span of humanity, why had nobody ever succeeded?

Perhaps there were a long line of Gertrude Robinsons throughout history, but I found that hard to credit. Could it be, then, that there was something in the very concept of the rituals that meant they couldn’t succeed?

She was clearly having similar thoughts in that last year, all of which culminated with the People’s Church.

When I saw that she was making no preparations whatsoever to stop it, I realized she was putting into practice a theory, and one she couldn’t afford to be wrong. She was going to wait, and see if the unopposed ritual succeeded, or if it collapsed under its own strain as mine had all those years ago.

Knowing Gertrude, I’m sure she had a backup plan if she had miscalculated – but she had not. The ritual failed. And all at once, I realized what had to be done.

You see, the thing about the Fears is that they can never be truly separated from each other. When does the fear of sudden violence transition into the fear of hunted prey? When does the mask of the Stranger become the deception of the Spiral?

Even those that seem to exist in direct opposition rely on each other for their definition as much as up relies on down.

To try and create a world with only the Buried makes as much sense as trying to conceive a world with only down.

Every ritual tied itself so closely to a single power as to render itself impossible. They could bring their patron close, but never sever it from the others, and eventually it would be violently pulled back into the place next to reality where they dwell.

The solution, then, is simple: A new ritual must be devised which will bring through all the Powers at once. All fourteen, as I had hoped I could complete it before any new powers such as Extinction were able to fully emerge. All under the Eye’s auspices, of course. We mustn’t forget our roots.

And there was only one being that could possibly serve as a lynchpin for this new ritual: The Archivist. A position that had so recently become vacant, thanks to Gertrude’s ill-timed retirement plans.

Because the thing about the Archivist is that – well, it’s a bit of a misnomer.

It might, perhaps, be better named: The Archive.

Because you do not administer and preserve the records of fear, John. You are a record of fear, both in mind as you walk the shuddering record of each statement, and in body as the Powers each leave their mark upon you.

You are a living chronicle of terror.

Perhaps, then, if I could find an Archivist and have each Power mark them, have them confront each one and each in turn instill in them a powerful and acute fear for their life, they could be turned into a conduit for the coming of this – nightmare kingdom.

Do you see where I’m going, John?

It does tickle me, that in this world of would-be occult dynasties and ageless monsters, the Chosen One is simply that – someone I chose. It’s not in your blood, or your soul, or your destiny. It’s just in your own, rotten luck.

[Thunderclaps.]
I’ll admit, my options were somewhat limited, but My God, when you came to me already marked by the Web, I knew it had to be you. I even held out some small hope you had been sent by the Spider as some sort of implicit blessing on the whole project, and, do you know what, I think it was.

Of course, I had to bide my time, get a measure of you before I began to push, learn how you worked – So I decided I would wait until something came for you, and see how you reacted. Attacks upon the Archives were not uncommon during Gertrude’s tenure, and, while she was always prepared, I made sure you would not be.

I reasoned if you couldn’t survive a single encounter, you were unlikely to make it through all fourteen. So, when Jane Prentiss attacked, I watched eagerly, one hand on the gas release from the start.

You acquitted yourself well enough, so I decided to see how far you would get, though I waited until the worms were in you before I pulled the lever. I needed to make sure you felt that fear all the way to your bones.

The discovery that one of the Stranger’s minions had infiltrated the Institute in the aftermath was certainly a pleasant bonus. Even if that sliver of paranoia, that vague wrongness you couldn’t quite place wouldn’t count as a mark, it was only a matter of time before it confronted you in a far more direct and affecting matter.

Admittedly, given the advent of the Unknowing, I needn’t have bothered. But what’s the old saying about hindsight?

More important to me was Sasha’s encounter with the Distortion. If it had taken an interest, then I very much wanted it to cross your path.

[Thunder continues as he goes on.]
So I found one of its current victims and convinced her to make a statement.

Poor Helen. I actually had to put her in a taxi myself, she was getting so lost in those narrow London side streets.

It worked, though.

[Something creaks. Another loud snap/crackle.]
Between the stabbing and at least two desperate flights into its doors – you’re marked very deeply by the Spiral.

Jurgen Leitner was a surprise, of course, and I was forced to improvise. I had no idea how much Gertrude would have told him, and he could very easily have derailed everything if you learned too much too fast.

I… justified it to myself saying I was going to have to send you out into the world anyway, if you were to encounter more of the Powers, but I can’t honestly pretend it wasn’t a… rather rash move.

Still. I’d requested Detective Tonner be assigned to the case when they found Gertrude’s body in the hope that having a Hunter in the mix would eventually lead to a confrontation, and setting you up as a killer certainly hastened that.

Then it was just a matter of feeding you statements to lead you to a few Avatars I thought were likely to harm you – but probably would stop short of actually killing you.

Jude served her purpose exactly as I had hoped, as did our dearly departed Mr. Crew, marking you for the Desolation and the Vast.

Honestly, I had – nothing to do with Melanie and her Slaughter adventure, but when I saw the situation, I made sure to trap her here, so when her rage bubbled over you would be right there, a ready target.

I didn’t foresee the mark coming from surgery gone wrong, but it was a very pleasant surprise.

The Unknowing was a distraction, but not an unwelcome one. For this to work, you needed more than just the marks; you needed power. And that was something the Unknowing served to test, though it posed no actual danger in the grand scheme of things.

And it did serve another purpose, of course. It inadvertently pushed you to confront death, a mark I had been very worried about trying to orchestrate. If I tried too early, you’d just die. Too late, and you might be powerful enough to see the attempt coming, and maybe even understand why.

As it was, it was just right, and once again, you came through with flying colors.

By this point, your abilities were coming along in leaps and bounds, and I was concerned that meeting face-to-face might end up with you – (sigh) – Knowing something you shouldn’t.

I had initially planned to go into hiding, but when your colleagues surprised me with the police, well. It was simple enough to cut a deal.

All that remained, then, were the Dark, the Flesh, the Buried, and the Lonely.

I was a little put out when that idiot Jared Hopworth misinterpreted my letters and attacked the Institute too soon, before you were even out of the hospital, but then – Ho, you should have see my face when you voluntarily went to him.

I couldn’t see what happened in there, of course, but given how you came out, I’m very sure it counts as a mark.

I suspected the coffin might turn up again, and once it did, it was simply a matter of getting any, uh… restraining factors you might have had flying off on a wild goose chase, and waiting.

Honestly, Detective Tonner has been proving invaluable through this process. I’d been racking my brains for months about what I could use to lure you in.

And, of course, I knew the Dark Sun was just sitting there waiting. So when it came time, I just whipped up another apocalypse and sent you on your merry way.

Then all that remained was the Lonely.

Poor Peter. He really should have left well enough alone. (cruel laugh) Or just done what I’d asked in the first place.

Ah well. He knew what I was attempting, and was very unwilling to cooperate until I made him a little wager about Martin.

Of course, he had no way of knowing that, in addition to setting you up for the final mark, he was giving you all the tools you needed to escape from it.

How is Martin, by the way? He looks well. You will keep an eye on him when all this is over, won’t you? He’s earned that.

And there, I think, we are brought just about up to date. I have enjoyed our little trip down memory lane, but past here lies only impatience.

You are prepared. You are ready. You are marked. The power of the Ceaseless Watcher flows through you, and the time of our victory is here.

Don’t worry, John. You’ll get used to it here, in the world that we have made.

Now. (cruel, cruel laugh) Repeat after me.

[When The Archivist begins to read the incantation, a heavy, dense static returns and begins to build, adding in higher pitches as it does so.]
You who watch and know and understand none. You who listen and hear and will not comprehend. You who wait and wait and drink in all that is not yours by right.

Come to us in your wholeness.

Come to us in your perfection.

Bring all that is fear and all that is terror and all that is the awful dread that crawls and chokes and blinds and falls and twists and leaves and hides and weaves and burns and hunts and rips and bleeds and dies!

Come to us.

I – OPEN – THE DOOR!

[An explosive sound of breaking glass; the static stays high and heavy and oppressive.]
[TAPE GARBLES AND MAKES A SOUND AKIN TO REWINDING.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE, SOME TIME LATER]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
MARTIN
(frantic) Wake up. Wake up. Wait, John, John, John, WAKE UP!

[He slaps the Archivist; the Archivist immediately shudders awake with a disoriented yell.]
ARCHIVIST
(dazed) Uh– Wh– Martin?

MARTIN
John!

ARCHIVIST
Wha– Wh– (more lucid) Oh god. What– What happened?

MARTIN
I, I don’t, I don’t know; everything– (close to tears) It’s all gone wrong!

ARCHIVIST
Help me up!

[He grunts as Martin does exactly that, breathing heavy.]
MARTIN
No, no, no – don’t, don’t go outside. It’s– It’s real bad.

[Silence as the Archivist presumably goes to the window.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh god.

MARTIN
I don’t know if it’s just here, or –

ARCHIVIST
No. No, it’s everywhere. They’re all here now. (voice shaking – but in awe?) I can feel all of it.

MARTIN
John. John, I’m scared.

ARCHIVIST
The whole world is afraid, Martin. Because of me.

[He seems to be laughing in the background – or it could be crying.]
ARCHIVIST
And The Watcher –

[His voice is distorted when he speaks, in a way extremely reminiscent of Michael/Helen and Nikola Orsinov.]
ARCHIVIST
– drinks it all in.

MARTIN
(quietly) John?

ARCHIVIST
(still distorted, with shaking laughter/tears) Look at the sky, Martin. Look at the sky. It’s looking back.

[And now he does begin to laugh in earnest. It’s not a laugh we’ve heard on him before; not a short, clipped laugh; not a surprise burst of genuine hilarity. This laugh seems afraid, and yet cold. It’s reminiscent of Elias’s villainous laugh, but is tinged more with fear than satisfaction.]
[He does not stop laughing.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
