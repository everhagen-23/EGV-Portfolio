        <h1>Game Analysis of "How Fish is Made"</h1>
        <section class="block1">
            <h2> Game Summary </h2>
            <h3>Main Game</h3>
            <p> You spawn into the game as, quite literally, a fish out of water in some sort of
                mysterious mechcanical landscape. In front of you another fish stands, or more
                accurately flops, and warns you of the most important choice in your little fish
                life: UP or DOWN. This quandry is the crux of the game, as every fish who enters
                this place must decide for themselves eventually.</p>
            <img class="vgr1" src="images/vgr/b1.gif" alt="x" />
            <p>You proceed into the next room and meet two more of your fellow sardines, both of
                which have strong opinions on which direction you should choose. The first fish, a
                restless sardine with a red soda tab around its jaw, excitedly proclaims that up is
                the only correct answer, at least in its opinion, is UP. It makes sure that you
                agree with it's choice, as it wants you to make the right choice too. Just across
                the room lies another fish, this one an introspective sardine with a blue plastic
                six pack ring around its body, who boasts about its intellect and thought process,
                all of which lead to the true choice: DOWN. This fish does not attempt to convince
                you if you disagree, as it believes you would be a fool to doubt its knowledge. Now
                you may have realized the same thing as me by now, both fish are both so confident
                in what the right choice is, but both disagree with each other and refuse to even
                humor the opposite opinion. Later down the line you encounter a third sardine, who
                is faced with a conundrum and filled with uncertainty. Its entire family has chosen
                to go upwards, but its best friend has chosen downwards, and it has no clue who to
                follow. It asks you for advice, and finds conviction to back whichever choice you
                choose, however later it asks if you are also going the same way, and if not it once
                again is filled with fear about the future. </p>

                 /></figure>
            <p>Now it is time for your first descent, this time into a pit that looks eerily akin to
                a stomach tube. You fall and fall until you emerge into a dark room that looks
                comfortably mechanical once more. Behind you there is a fish that is revelling in,
                what it sees as, the holiness of this situation. The sardine goes on and on about
                how even though no one here can understand what lies at the end of UP or DOWN it
                must mean something grand. This fish does not give an opinion on which direction is
                the right choice, so you continue to the next hallway, where, this time you meet yet
                other sardine, who is, very unfortunately, stuck between 2 gears that open the next
                set of doors. It says that it does not know the answer to what direction is best but
                it does know that you absolutely should not press the button to open the doors.
                Tragically the game does require you to progress, so you spare this sardine the
                pressure of making a choice and press the button, squeezing him into several pieces.
                You once again proceed, this time encountering two creatures, one a sardine and one
                a parasite who serves as its tongue. They sing a little song about how you can only
                make the best of your situation and attempt to cheer you up from your grim fate, and
                once again, you proceed to the next area. Here you are presented with a pile of
                lifeless fish that you must flop past to enter the final few zones before you must
                make your inevitable choice </p>
            <figure>

                <img class="vgr2" src="images/vgr/s3.gif"

                <img class="vgr2" src="images/vgr/s1.gif" alt="a pile of dead fish" /></figure>
            <p>You flop pass through another dark hallway with what appear to be ominous plants, and
                eventually come across a fish who confronts you about your choices, not just your
                final choice, but how you've acted up until this point. Have you stayed true to your
                original choice? Have you lied to the other fish about what you will do? Are you
                still 100% that you are making the right choice? After questioning you the fish
                laughs and says that these are not important questions in the end. You proceed
                onwards and meet your last fishy friend, who talks about how it was always the big
                fish in the sea and it feels silly to be so scared now, and reveals that it has been
                tracking how many fish chose UP and how many chose DOWN. It offers you a
                proposition, you choose which direction it goes and in turn it will tell you how it
                goes. It thanks you for giving it one last chance to feel important and will tell
                you "it feels soft" if you sent it DOWN and "it feels " if you choose UP, all before
                going silent.</p>

                <img class="vgr2" src="images/vgr/s4.gif"

                <img class="vgr2" src="images/vgr/s6.gif"
                    alt="a fish entangled in a net brags about his throne of inspiration"
                 /></figure>
            <p>Now the moment of truth. During my first playthrough I stuck loosely to the plan of
                going downwards, however in these final moments I did have a flicker of doubt in my
                mind. In the end I chose to follow my ally downwards and achieved the fate of being
                served on a plate in a resturant somewhere, along with my fellow sardines. If I had
                gone upwards I would've instead assimilated with a mass of rotting fishy flesh,
                which is an equally unsavory fate.</p>

            <h3> Expansion: Last One and Then Another</h3>
            <p> The creators of this game later went on to create Mouthwashing, a game that has
                sparked in popularity within the past month or two, however they originally created
                an expansion to How Fish Is Made to promote it. Here you are a surivor of the
                machine, in an unknown place where you are given two options: LEAVE or CONSUME. You
                cannot leave. You roll around absorbing the parts of your fellow fishes' bodies, all
                so you can further grow and consume. Eventually your adventures in consumption lead
                you to a heavily bandaged man, who is never introduced, but looks identical to Curly
                from Mouthwashing. Essentially you are stuck in this loop until you have consumed
                enough to make your "body" large enough to consume Curly. After doing this an ad for
                Mouthwashing plays and the fish with a parastic tongue from eariler urges you to add
                the game to your wishlist. </p>

            <h2>Game Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
            <p>This game does a terrific job combining the visuals of both the organic and the
                mechanical to create a uniquely eerie setting. My particular favorite implementation
                of this is a particular hallway in which it resembles both a mechcanical track and
                an organic digestion system. The game also has a tendency towards either red or
                green lighting, which even in a mechanical setting draws back to organic life. </p>
            <img class="vgr1" src="images/vgr/s2.gif"
                alt="hallway that looks like a digestion system" />
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>This game certainly feels like you are a fish out of water with the controls at
                times, as precise movement is difficult and it took a bit of practice to get the
                hang of things. You only have two options, movement via WASD and interaction through
                either the space bar or C key. You control the camera with the mouse, which I
                imagine would be smoother with a real mouse and not a mousepad, however I did not
                have that option. Essentially your only two actions are eihter to talk with other
                fish and to proceed forward. I believe that this helps sell the atmosphere of the
                game, as fish can't do a whole lot, and the lack of control furthers the feeling of
                a march to your inevitable fate. </p>
            <h3>Characters</h3> <p>You meet a lot of different fish in this game and although you only
            see one of them twice (if you count the DLC ending) they all represent something
                different along your journey. The first two fish represent blind conviction and faith,
                without listening to the other side, and even though they may not be as superior as they
                believe themselves to be, they are not afraid of what comes after their choice. Apart
                from these fish we do not meet any fish who is certain of their choice, and although
                these fish may be incorrect in their judgement, at least they are not scared or in
                denial like the rest. The third fish is afraid of making his choice, as he is a
                follower, and has no idea who to follow when his friend and family are split. This fish
                may think he is smart, gathering the opinions of others, but in reality all he does is
                run from having to make the choice himself. The fourth fish observes another fallen fish
                who's life has been claimed by the machine, however instead of acknowledging his fear he
                turns to a belief that the machine is holy, and even though we do not understand it,
                surely we are lucky to be in it's clutches. </p>
            <h3>Commentary</h3>
            <p> I think that is it relatively easy to say that this game is not about your final choice. At the end of the day, you will die or suffer regardless of which direction you take. The game is about the process of making a choice, not the actual choice itself, and all the different perspectives. Looking at the two endings of the game I would go a step further and say that perhaps this games is about the importance of strong conviction, as you suffer in both endings, however you either die at peace with your fellow sardines or you live in an uncoordinated mass of fish flesh forevermore. Both options are not ideal, but the fishy flesh mass specifically highlights the horror of indecision.</p>
