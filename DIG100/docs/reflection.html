            <p> GitHub and WordPress are two services that can be used to create websites, however, within the two services, there are quite a few differences, especially in the manner that you go about building your site. WordPress has more appeal to the unknowledgeable beginner in comparison to GitHub, however it lacks the freedom present in pure HTML and CSS code.</p>
                
               <p> GitHub looks intimidating to the average web design newcomer, however, it truly is not that difficult once you get the hang of it. The primary blockade when it comes to GitHub repos and website hosting is the heavy usage of HTML code, but after learning how to use it I can say that that is not a blockade that should stop anyone. HTML and CSS can be learned quickly through a few tutorials, and there are plenty of online resources to help people learn everything they need as they go. The primary advantage of HTML code is that you are given the freedom to do essentially anything with your website, and although it may take some time and error, your final product will be extremely unique and personal in comparison to other services with pre-made templates. </p>
                
                <p>WordPress, on the other hand, may look like the easy way out, however after attempting to navigate through its many interfaces I can assure you that that is untrue. Its primary benefit is that it comes with many preset themes, requires absolutely no HTML knowledge, and you are almost always guaranteed a decent-looking final product. However, these benefits come with a cost, it is much more difficult to get WordPress to do exactly what you want it to do, which is okay if you just need a website on the fly, but it becomes more problematic if you want to do something more unique with your site.</p>
                
                <p>In comparison, GitHub offers much more creative freedom, whereas WordPress offers an assurance that your website will always look good. WordPress allows you to easily shift between themes, whereas, even with well-formed CSS, GitHub requires more effort to do a visual overhaul of your website. In my personal opinion, once you have learned HTML creating a website using GitHub is far more intuitive than creating one using WordPressâ€™ confusing menu systems. As far as learning more in the future I would like to learn how to make more complicated mechanisms and how to implement JavaScript into my GitHub site. For my site on WordPress, my main area of interest is learning how to more effectively transfer HTML code into my pages, as that way, I hopefully have to rely less on the menus and navigation systems. </p>
                
                <p> Overall I much prefer Github to WordPress, however, I can note that WordPress is not without its benefits and Github is not without its flaws. When it comes to keeping up with this website I primarily plan on focusing my effort on the GitHub site as opposed to the one hosted with WordPress. </p>
