Statement of Jonathan Sims, Head Arch– [sigh] former Head Archivist at the Magnus Institute, London, regarding a childhood encounter with a book formerly possessed by Jurgen Leitner. Statement recorded by subject, February 18th, 2017.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I have been thinking a lot over the last couple of days about how this began. For me, that is. I cannot help but feel that hand in hand with the death of Jurgen Leitner came the death of the lens through which I viewed the world. Even in the depths of my paranoia, something I now attribute to the presence of… of the being that was posing as Sasha, like a grain of sand behind my eye, rubbing and irritating, but with no clear cause.

Even then, I knew how the world worked. There were supernatural things in the world, but they were rare – isolated and exaggerated, vastly outnumbered by wild tales and drunken imaginings. The one name I held in my mind as a true source of evil was Jurgen Leitner, and I knew him as the worst of it, for it was his name that had marked the encounter that scarred my youth. And of course, in my heart, I knew that no-one else could have possibly seen anything as horrible as I had. Well, maybe I could have named one person, but… I watched him disappear forever.

But now I know what Jurgen Leitner truly was. A spoiled child, playing with forces he barely understood, calling himself a jailor to things he couldn’t even conceptualise. There is so much more horror in this world than I had ever dreamt possible. And my suffering, I now know, pales in comparison to what has befallen others far more innocent than I. But perhaps not for long.

These beings that lurk beyond us know my name and, if I understand Leitner correctly, one of them has already claimed me. The Eye. Appropriate, I suppose. I do not know how many of them there are, or precisely how they separate, but I do know that the Eye – Beholding – was not the first that I encountered in my life. The first was the Spider. The Web. And I have no idea what that might mean.

I was eight years old when my grandmother gave me the book. No-one ever believes me when I tell them my age. I don’t know if it’s the already greying hair or something in my demeanour, but they always act surprised when I mention being a child in the Nineties. I will admit the last few years have aged me considerably. Regardless, it must have been a year or two since the library was destroyed, though I had no inkling of it at the time.

My parents had passed away when I was too young to really remember them; my father of an accidental fall when I was two, and my mother a couple of years later from complications during routine surgery. My extended family weren’t close and I had no siblings, so I ended up living with my grandmother, a kind enough woman, but she had already raised her children, and the resentment she felt at having to raise another was never something she completely managed to hide from me. It seemed to mingle with her grief, so the sadness over her own lost son would manifest in recriminations and bitterness.

Saying this aloud I worry I’m painting too bleak a picture of my grandmother. She cared for me as well as she was able, and whatever her private feelings might have been, she did try her best.

And I was hardly an easy child to deal with. While I may not have shared the inclinations of my peers towards active mischief, I was precocious and impatient, quick to talk back, and even quicker to wander off whenever I grew bored. By the time I was eight, the police had had to return me from my explorations at least three times, and my grandmother swore that if it happened again she would begin locking me inside the house. And I fully believed her.

She did discover that the one thing that could keep me rooted to the spot were books. Television pacified me for a half hour or so, but a book would keep me in place until I had finished it, and for all the voracity of my reading, I was never actually that fast, lingering on pages that caught my imagination. So in this she saw a solution. The difficulty was I was also very picky, and looking back on it there was little rhyme or reason to what I did or did not care to read. I never tried to really define it, but I think the closest I could come to putting it into words was that I hated to read anything I felt like I had read before. This made it something of a nightmare to keep me entertained, as any author with a distinctive enough style would only ever afford me a single book’s worth of reading before I tired of them. I can still hear my grandmother’s voice, trying to hide that irritation bubbling up: “But you like Diana Wynne Jones!”

In the end, she came up with a solution that now seems like a stroke of genius, although at the time I found it strange and bothersome. The local library was some distance away, so between visits, my grandmother would go to all the local charity and second-hand bookshops and buy up every book they had that was fifty pence or less, then she would present me the pile and I would look through it until I found something I liked, or at least tolerated, and then I would read that. After I was completely done with the pile, she would donate it to one of the other charity shops.

It wasn’t something that could be kept up forever, but it worked for longer than you’d think. It was shortly after she had started with this system that I found… my first Leitner.

One of the things that annoyed me most about my grandmother’s approach was that she never seemed to exercise any sort of judgement at all about how appropriate something might be for me. I didn’t mind this so much when it let me read a slightly-too-gruesome thriller, but she would also often present me with stacks full of bright, square cardboard books, of the sort you’d read aloud to a pre-schooler. These bothered me far more than any dull technical manual or dog-eared dictionary, as I couldn’t help but feel it was making a comment about my intelligence. I mean, obviously that was absurd – I watched my grandmother grabbing the books without even glancing at their covers, just checking the price and stacking them. But somehow, it still felt like an insult that she might in some way think I was at a level to be reading The Elephant and the Balloon, or whatever nonsense it was.

So, when searching through the latest trove of books, I felt my hand grip another square, thin volume, I almost discarded it without even looking. But I did look. And what I saw immediately struck me as odd. Instead of the garish colours that I expected, the cover was monochrome, matt white with scratchy black webs covering its corners, and in the middle of the cover, half-written, half-carved in a childlike hand was the title: A Guest for Mr. Spider.

On the back cover there was no blurb, just a crudely sketched image of what I assumed to be the eponymous Mr. Spider. He stood upright on his spindly back legs, attached to a disproportionately swollen abdomen. The rest of his legs were splayed at odd angles, as though in the middle of some sort of dance, and his head had no mouth, but was covered asymmetrically with eight eyes of all shapes and sizes. On the top of it there sat a small bowler hat, which had been drawn in a splash of red ink, unlike the black and white which made up the rest of the image.

I was a bit taken aback. I had seen plenty of children’s books that tried to be a little bit scary, or ended up being unintentionally disturbing, but this felt different. There was something to this drawing, to this book, that I’d never seen before. A violence seemed to ooze from it, sticky and pungent. I had no idea what was inside, but I knew that I hated that book. And I knew that wasn’t going to stop me opening it. You know what was immediately inside the cover. If you’re in a position to be listening to this, you know exactly whose mark was there.

The book itself starts with a blank room in a simple house, almost entirely bare save for a small table with a pot of flowers on it and two doors. The flowers are drooping in a way that might just be a poor rendering of bluebells, but with the black and white it just makes them look sick.

In the centre of the room stands the figure I take to be Mr. Spider, his arms are still splayed wildly, and his back is turned to the reader. He is staring, it seems, at the door on the left. On the next page the image is identical, save that the arms are now in different places. The third and the fourth are the same again. There is no text on any of them.

Then, on page five, the words ‘KNOCK KNOCK’ appear next to the door in the same style as the words of the title. Mr. Spider’s arms are suddenly straight and still by his side. The text comes again: ‘WHO IS IT, MR. SPIDER?’

The door opens, and stood there is a thin, scrawny looking fly clutching a box. It is crudely dressed in an ill-fitting suit. It is hard to tell from the fly’s face, but his attitude seems to be one of trepidation or anxiety. ‘IT’S MR. BLUEBOTTLE’, the text reads, ‘AND HE’S BROUGHT YOU A CAKE’. The next page is a close-up rendering of a large slice of cake in a box; it does have colour, but it’s a pale green that makes me think of disease. Then comes a page showing the insectoid face of Mr. Bluebottle, the worry now stark etched there. Then there is a page with no picture at all, just the words: ‘MR. SPIDER DOESN’T LIKE IT’.

Then the book returns to the room. Both doors are once again closed. The only difference between this image and the one on the very first page is the ink that seems to have been spilled on the lower half of the right-hand door. There are several more pages of Mr. Spider waiting, his arms a windmill of activity.

Then another ‘KNOCK KNOCK’ on the left door, and Mr. Spider goes rigid. ‘WHO IS IT, MR. SPIDER?’ In that position it’s clear his belly is even larger than it was before. The door opens on another fly, this one slightly larger, wearing a pale yellow dress. ‘IT’S MRS. FRUIT’, the book announces, ‘AND SHE’S BROUGHT YOU SOME FLOWERS’. The flowers on the next page look even less healthy than the ones on the table, and are coloured with a gentle pink. A close-up on her face, frozen in stark fear. ‘MR. SPIDER DOESN’T EAT FLOWERS’, the next page announces, and Mrs. Fruit is gone, the door closed again.

The right hand door is more noticeably stained now; the once-black ink now seems like a dark, crusty brown at the hinges and the seams. The flowers brought by the doomed fruit fly now stand on the table, but they are more clearly wilted and stained a deep, vivid red. Mr. Spider’s abdomen is engorged and straining, and where his mouth would be is marked by the same dried brown colour as the door. His arms are moving once again.

On the messier page, with more colour to contrast it, I can see that his hands aren’t empty, but are weaving and pulling on thin grey threads, that stretch all around the room, and out through the cracks in both doors.

‘KNOCK KNOCK. WHO IS IT, MR. SPIDER?’ Behind the door stands a large, burly fly, this one dressed in baggy overalls. Next to it stands a much smaller fly, dressed in what appears to be a child’s version of those same overalls. They are both openly weeping. ‘IT’S MR. HORSE. AND HE’S BROUGHT YOU HIS SON’. The close-up on that fly’s face is an image that still comes to me when I’m having trouble sleeping. Then the text: ‘MR. SPIDER WANTS MORE.’

When we go back to the picture of the empty parlour it’s smeared all over with dark reds and browns. Mr. Spider’s abdomen now dwarfs the rest of him and seeps a sticky red, along with the now clearly visible grey thread. He has turned to face the reader. Staring into me as his arms move and move and move.

The second-to-last page shows the right-hand door up close, the stains and the ink seeping from the edges. It looks like it has a cut-away panel that can be opened onto the final page. ‘MR. SPIDER WANTS ANOTHER GUEST FOR DINNER’ it reads, ‘IT IS POLITE TO KNOCK’. I feel my hand closing into a fist and reaching for the door, preparing to rap my knuckles on the grimy old wood.

It was at that moment that a hand far bigger than my own slapped the book from my grip, before shoving me hard in the chest and sending me sprawling onto the floor. I was in the park a few roads away from my house. Had I taken the book there to read? Or did I somehow wander there while engrossed in it? To this day I don’t know, but I was in the park, and standing over me was… you know, for the life of me I can’t remember his name. Thomas, maybe? Daniel? I almost want to say Michael, but that isn’t it. He saved my life, and I can’t remember his name. Why does your memory do that to so many important people? Some people deserve to be remembered.

He was a bully. Eighteen or nineteen, I think. He helped my grandmother with odd jobs sometimes, just a bit of cash-in-hand work, but he had always taken a dislike to me. At the time I had convinced myself that it was because of how smart I was, since he was, to put it charitably, not very clever, but I have since come to the conclusion that I was a deeply annoying child. Still, he was more than twice my age, so I’m certainly not excusing his decision to torment me whenever he got the chance. Name-calling, the odd beating, sometimes stealing from me – all very standard. He just made the extremely poor choice to do it at that exact moment.

My tormentor bent down and picked up what he had slapped out of my hands and examined the book. I was too dazed to protest, and he started to mock “little Einstein” for reading “a kiddie book”. But as he did so, he flicked through it, and as his eyes passed over more and more of the page, the words tailed off, and he seemed to be reading it himself. His hands shook ever so slightly as he slowly made his way through it, and his legs began to move. It was jerky and unsteady, and he didn’t seem to notice that he was doing it.

I had no idea what was going on, not really, but I was somehow desperate to get that book back. He was much bigger than me, though, so all I could do was follow as he walked down alleys and side streets. There were fewer and fewer people about, and I realised with a start that I had failed to notice nightfall. At the far end of a quiet residential road, he walked up to one of the houses. I never found it again, and for all I knew it might have actually been his house. He was still reading. When he reached the entrance, he held up the book and placed it on the front door. I saw that cut-away panel of Mr. Spider’s stained and bloody right-hand door. And he knocked on it twice. I saw the words clearly in my mind almost more than I heard the sound: ‘KNOCK KNOCK’.

The door opened, and inside was dark. Against that darkness I could see the thin grey strands wrapped around the limbs of my former bully. And then, from inside, stretched two impossibly long limbs, bony and covered in coarse, black hair. For a second, there was almost the start of a scream, but the legs wrapped around him too quickly, and he disappeared into the doorway and out of sight. It slammed behind him, and he was gone, taking the book with him.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

You can see, I hope, why this engendered in me something of a fascination with the supernatural, and some deep feelings regarding the name ‘Jurgen Leitner’. I cannot corroborate this story in any real form for obvious reasons. My grandmother peacefully passed away five years ago and there is no-one else who would have records of anything other than the general context. If I were assessing this as someone else’s statement, I would have dismissed it out of hand, and don’t think that doesn’t eat at me. But it is so vivid in my mind. The spider’s legs reaching from that tiny door. The first of the dark powers to touch me, perhaps, but it did not claim me.

Speaking this out loud for the first time, I am struck by something else. The feeling I have been living with my whole life, that if that poor idiot hadn’t gotten involved he would still be alive. A strange conviction that, if I had been able to face that thing myself, maybe I could have saved him.

Stopped it. Ridiculous, of course, I was eight, but it has made me reconsider my attitude to getting help. I have consistently kept the others at arm’s length, tried to deal with things myself and it… it hasn’t gone well. Whatever is going on, this ‘Unknowing’ that S– Not! Sasha was talking about, Elias killing Gertrude and maybe Leitner as well… I need help. I need allies. I just wish this revelation didn’t come just as everyone is convinced I’m a deranged killer.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, um… hello!

GEORGIE
Everything okay, John?

[DOOR CLOSES]
ARCHIVIST
Er, yeah. Just recording some thoughts. Didn’t… I didn’t know when you were going to be home.

GEORGIE
Sure.

[COAT IS PUT DOWN]
Did you… clean the kitchen?

ARCHIVIST
Er, a bit. I, I mean, I can’t exactly pay you anything; I thought…

GEORGIE
It’s fine. To be honest, it’s nice to have someone keep the Admiral company while I’m out.

ARCHIVIST
He literally just sleeps on the radiator. I… I’ve got a lot of time to kill.

GEORGIE
You… looking for a new job yet?

ARCHIVIST
It’s complicated, there’s… there’s a lot of stuff hanging over from the last one I’ve got to take care of.

GEORGIE
Well, like I said, you’re welcome here as long as you need.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose you are rolling in all that sock money.

GEORGIE
Urgh.

ARCHIVIST
Up to your eyeballs in mattresses.

GEORGIE
Don’t. They did send me one, you know. Oh, it was dreadful. I couldn’t sleep on it. I managed three days before my back gave out. I’ve still got it somewhere in the guest room, if the other one’s not up to your exacting standards.

ARCHIVIST
Ooh… I think I’m alright. I was going to make a cup of tea if you want one?

GEORGIE
Maybe later, I’ve got recording of my own to do.

ARCHIVIST
Right you are. I’ll… I’ll keep quiet.

GEORGIE
I wouldn’t worry too much. The studio’s pretty well soundproofed.

ARCHIVIST
What’s this one about?

GEORGIE
Oh, I’m trying to find some new angle on the Ancient Ram Inn.

ARCHIVIST
I thought there’d already been a What the Ghost on that?

GEORGIE
No. No, you’re thinking of every other hacky, ghost podcast. But, you know, if it sells a few T-shirts….

ARCHIVIST
Oh, I, yes, I meant to say, actually, thank you for –

GEORGIE
Oh, it’s fine. Though I don’t know what sort of “employment dispute” leaves you without a change of clothes.

ARCHIVIST
You wouldn’t believe me.

GEORGIE
Do you even listen to my podcast? I’ll believe anything. But, on air.

ARCHIVIST
I will tell you, Georgie, I… I just…

GEORGIE
It’s alright. There’s no rush. I mean, it was clearly pretty bad, so only when you’re ready. If you’re ready.

ARCHIVIST
Thanks. I… Thank you.

GEORGIE
Sure. Anyway, I got recording to be doing. Catch you after.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

DAISY
Fine.

MARTIN
Sorry. I just… I feel more comfortable with it on.

DAISY
I said it was fine.

MARTIN
Yeah, right, so, um… Statement of Martin Blackwood, interviewed by Detective D– Tonner. February 18th, two thousand and –

DAISY
What are you doing?

MARTIN
I… I’m making a statement. Isn’t that what you want? My statement?

DAISY
No. I just need you to answer the question.

MARTIN
Oh. Okay. I mean, y-you wanted a statement last time. About…it was… when I found Gertrude. Or at least your partner did.

DAISY
Didn’t know who the killer was last time. This time it’s simpler. And… And Basira’s not a police officer anymore.

MARTIN
Oh. Look, y-you’re sure it was him? I mean, I know, I know… but I can’t… He wouldn’t!

…

I… I don’t think it was him.

DAISY
You think we should be looking for other suspects?

MARTIN
Wh– N-No! No, I mean, not – Look, that tape that we gave you…

DAISY
Has a lot of distortion, some screaming and a recording of you seeing the body, you claim for the first time. Always suspicious when two suspects are each other’s only alibi.

MARTIN
I told you that there was someone else there. It may…

DAISY
Which one should we be asking, by the way? The man with the knife hands or the woman trapped in your ‘magic corridors’?

MARTIN
It. Happened.

DAISY
Well, if your witnesses appear back in this universe, maybe the situation will change.

Otherwise, it’s an easy choice: answer my question or I pin it on you.

MARTIN
Y-You can’t! Th-That’s not how this works.

…

Is it?

DAISY
Let me tell you how this works, Mr. Blackwood. I’ve got a hell of a workload, no partner, and full operational discretion to make this whole situation go away. That means you help me, or I make things very unpleasant for you.

MARTIN
But you’re the police!

DAISY
So, help me stop a killer. Where is Jonathan Sims?

MARTIN
[Pause] I don’t know.

DAISY
Don’t lie to me.

MARTIN
I don’t!

DAISY
Everyone I’ve talked to says you and him were close.

MARTIN
What? [Inordinately pleased] Did they? I mean… I mean, who said that? I, I, I guess, I mean, more than the rest, yeah okay, but –

DAISY
Did he have any other friends? Anyone outside the Institute he might have talked to?

MARTIN
I… No, I don’t really… think so. I don’t, don’t think he had much of a life outside of this place.

DAISY
There’s nowhere? No-one he might turn to?

MARTIN
He never talked about his friends, worked all hours… No. I’m sorry.

DAISY
[Sigh] Right. Get lost. Send Stoker in.

MARTIN
That’s it?

DAISY
Unless you know something else.

MARTIN
What about Sasha?

DAISY
[Sigh] No sign of her body here or in the tunnels. No evidence she was the victim of violence. Maybe she saw the murder, or caught Sims smashing up the storage room, and took off. Maybe she’s with him. Or he killed her, too. Either way, quicker I find him, the better for her, so if there is anything you’re not telling me…

MARTIN
No. I just… Bring her back safe, okay?

…

I’ll send Tim in.

[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
DAISY
Tim Stoker.

…

That your name?

TIM
Yeah.

DAISY
You want me to leave this running?

TIM
No. You can turn it off.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
DAISY
Hm.

TIM
Huh. Seems about right. Look, just… just leave it on, or do you want to do this somewhere else?

DAISY
It’s fine.

TIM
Suppose you want my statement?

DAISY
I just need anything you know on the possible whereabouts of Jonathan Sims. Anywhere he feels safe, any friends or associates he might turn to?

TIM
No.

DAISY
You’re sure? Nothing that might help me find him? If you’re hiding something out of some sort of loyalty…

TIM
[Bitter laugh] Look, if I knew, I’d tell you. We haven’t talked too much lately.

DAISY
And you haven’t seen Sasha James either?

TIM
No. You think she’s dead?

DAISY
Can’t say yet. But looking at it, yeah, I think Sims killed her, too.

TIM
Sounds right. More bodies for the archive.

DAISY
You’ve got quite a turnover. Anything you want to tell me about it?

TIM
[Snort] Yeah, don’t take a job here.

DAISY
Oh… [amused grunt] You’re done, Mr. Stoker. Send in Bouchard.

[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
DAISY
Elias Bouchard?

ELIAS
Correct.

DAISY
Sit.

[CHAIR SHIFTS]
ELIAS
So, what can I do to help? You want my account? My sworn testimony? My statement?

DAISY
What is…? No. Just a couple of questions.

ELIAS
Of course.

DAISY
I don’t suppose you know how to turn this off?

ELIAS
Oh, leave it running. I’m sure John will want to review the tapes when he gets back.

DAISY
So you don’t think he did it?

ELIAS
Killed a man in cold blood? Certainly not. He doesn’t have the stomach for it.

DAISY
People can surprise you.

ELIAS
In John’s case, I rather hope so.

DAISY
You want him to be a murderer?

ELIAS
Have you had any luck identifying the body yet?

…

Well?

DAISY
I’m the one asking the questions.

ELIAS
Very well, then I suppose this interview is over. Unless you care to arrest me?

DAISY
[Pause] The victim isn’t someone we have on file. Doesn’t match any missing persons. Still a John Doe.

[ELIAS CHUCKLES]
I say something funny?

ELIAS
Nothing. Just remembering an old joke.

DAISY
Right. So. Do you know anything about the current whereabouts of Jonathan Sims? Anywhere he might be staying? Any friends he might have contacted?

ELIAS
I do.

DAISY
…

Well?

ELIAS
I was wondering. Is it worth it? Operating the way that you do?

DAISY
Just answer the question.

ELIAS
Does the lack of oversight make up for the lack of support?

DAISY
What do you know about the current whereabouts of Jonathan Sims?

ELIAS
Everything. I know exactly where he is and who is with him. But I don’t think I’m going to tell you.

DAISY
I can drag this down to the station if you want, you weird little freak. Maybe Sims didn’t do this alone.

ELIAS
Please, Detective Tonner. You don’t want this to happen in the police station any more than I do.

Your superiors, exactly how aware are they of what you’re doing right now?

DAISY
They know enough. They got a call and sent me down here. That’s how it works.

ELIAS
And then they don’t ask any questions, as long as you keep it far away from official police channels.

Except your partner leaving has made you sloppy. No notes, no proper interrogations, no back-up of any sort. You’ve barely collected a scrap of evidence from the scene, and made no official record of the dozens of interviews you’ve done with the Institute staff. You haven’t even followed up on any of the other potential suspects or leads, and shown no interest at all in the fate of Sasha James.

All you care about is where John is, because you’ve decided on a course of action, and you’re going to follow it through.

DAISY
…

If you’re right, what’s to stop me kicking your teeth in? No cameras down here, remember. I can always just turn off that little recorder of yours. Smash it up.

ELIAS
Very true. However, you aren’t going to do that, Detective. Because of Calvin Benchley.

DAISY
What?

ELIAS
Calvin Benchley. You recognise the name, don’t you Alice? You see, I know what you did.

DAISY
I… don’t know what you’re talking about.

ELIAS
No? The scar may have faded, but you haven’t forgotten.

Did it itch, just a little, when you were burying him?

DAISY
You shut the hell up, or I swear I’ll kill you.

ELIAS
A genuine threat, I’m sure, but right now what you’re really trying to figure out is, if I have any evidence that could make it back to your people. It seems impossible, of course – how could I? But you just don’t know. So many impossible things happen in here, in this strange, musty place.

DAISY
Shut up!

ELIAS
Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to make a statement. Your statement. To prove to you what I know, and because I want John to hear it someday. And when it’s over, you are going to leave. Because if you don’t, I’ll make sure your superiors know all about every nasty little thing you’ve done in the name of peace and order, and I’ll make sure they are subject to the scrutiny they so desperately want to avoid. More importantly, I’ll make sure they know it has all been exposed because of you. Is that clear?

…

I will take that as a yes.

If you’re smart, you’ll go back to the police station and put forward some half-baked cover-up for what happened to your mystery corpse and leave it at that. But I don’t think you are smart, so in many ways I’m excited to find out what you do next.

…

Statement of Alice Tonner, regarding the crimes and death of Calvin Benchley. Statement never given.

DAISY
Don’t.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
Everyone calls me Daisy. I like that because it sounds so gentle, and I’m the only one left who knows about the scar on my back. It doesn’t really look like a daisy, more like a starburst, but it’s what the doctor said when I got it, so that’s how I’ve always seen it. It makes me feel strong, to know that the soft nickname everyone calls me comes from a bloody wound. And I like to feel strong. To be in control.

DAISY
I’m going to kill you, someday.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
When I was eleven, I had a best friend, and his name was Calvin Benchley. We didn’t hang out at school much because his friends said I couldn’t play with them because I was a girl. But every day after getting home we’d go to the nearby park and play. It was small, just a scrap of grass and dirt, but if you hopped the fence to the south you could get into the cemetery, and if you went the other way you got into an old building site. The fence on that side was broken and jagged, but it collapsed enough that it was easy to climb over it, into the half-built structure.

Our parents had forbidden us from playing there. It was collapsing, as well as being a known hang-out for vagrants and druggies. We would take turns daring each other to go in there. That day, I dared him. That’s why it was my fault.

DAISY
Shut up. It wasn’t my fault.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
We had been in the park, when there had been shouting from the building site. Crashes. Violence. Then a long silence.

I dared him to take a look, and when he didn’t want to, I started making fun of him. So in he went. When he didn’t come back, I decided he was just trying to spook me. But after fifteen minutes I decided he wasn’t. I wanted to run away and get my mum, but I was frightened of getting in trouble, so instead I followed Calvin over the fence.

Inside were the first two dead bodies I had ever seen. They looked like they had attacked each other with broken glass. One lay impaled on a broken bottle, still holding the long shard of glass that jutted out of the other’s throat. There was blood everywhere. I felt a rush of fear, and a strange sort of excitement.

DAISY
You can’t know that.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
On a broken staircase above them, stood Calvin staring at me with vacant eyes. Standing behind him I saw something. A hunched figure. I think it was naked. I couldn’t see anything except pale flesh and the vivid red of cuts and injuries. Every inch of its body appeared to be covered in open wounds, but no blood seemed to flow from them.

The thing was utterly still, save for a lipless, scabby mouth, which moved so fast it was almost a blur, silently mouthing words that only Calvin could hear. I know they were for him, because with each movement of its jaw, the thing’s long, pointed black tongue would shoot out and flick itself into his ear. He was completely expressionless as that crooked, cut-up figure whispered to him and flicked at his ear with a barbed tongue.

DAISY
No.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
Then Calvin’s eyes turned to me. Without hesitation or expression he began running, sprinting right at me. I tried to get away, but he was faster, and slammed into me, pushing off my feet and into the rusted fence behind me. There was an explosion of pain in my back, as jagged metal embedded itself in my shoulder, and then it went dark. The last thing I remember before the hospital was the fierce pride on Calvin’s face as he stood there.

No-one believed me about what happened. Calvin said that I had tripped and fallen, and that was the story everyone accepted, but after that he was different. Moody. He started getting into fights. Everyone just assumed he was turning into a teenager, but six children at my school were seriously injured or killed by the time he left for university.

All accidents, of course, nothing that would have pointed to him. But I was always careful around him, the daisy-scar on my back a constant reminder that we were not friends, that he was no longer to be trusted. I told people, but he seemed to feed on the uneasy glances of his classmates, and took great pleasure in scaring them further.

Even after school, I kept an eye on him but I couldn’t believe he had never been arrested. I later got a look at his file and found out that he had been, but they’d never been able to make anything stick. He was smart and careful. We once almost nailed him for aggravated assault, but the victims changed their story and said they were the ones who attacked him.

DAISY
You’ve made your point.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
Six years ago, Calvin Benchley became the first human being I murdered. I beat him round the head as he was coming out of a bar, drove him to my usual spot and shot him five times in the chest with a handgun taken from the evidence lock-up. He didn’t beg for his life. He didn’t say a word. I don’t think he even recognised me. He was harder to get rid of than the vampires, but I managed it.

And nobody asked any questions at all. He was a scumbag, and nobody wants to risk getting a Section 31. He was the first human I dealt with like that, but he certainly wasn’t the last.

ELIAS
Do I need to go on, Detective Tonner?

…

Good. Feel free to see yourself out. If you take any action against myself or this Institute, I will ensure the police become aware of your crimes in a way that cannot be ignored or covered up.

I leave the matter of Jonathan Sims up to you, though I will not tell you where he is. I suggest you close the case and move on, but if you find yourself unable to do so, my advice is to kill him quickly. There’s no telling what he might be capable of.

[CHAIR MOVES AND DOOR OPEN.]
DAISY
One day, someone is going to kill you. I really hope it’s me.

[DOOR SLAMS]
ELIAS
Good day, Detective.

So?

MARTIN
So, I’m just saying, she spends all that time in there with Elias, and then leaves like that? Maybe he told her something.

TIM
Or maybe she just hates it here. Like a normal person.

MARTIN
Maybe they said something about Sasha, y’know?

TIM
She’s dead, Martin. Come on! Even you’re not that blind. He got her, too.

MARTIN
Don’t you say that. Don’t you dare say that!

TIM
I didn’t. It was that detective. Y-You try talking to her about it?

MARTIN
She didn’t care. Just wanted to know where he was.

TIM
Makes sense.

MARTIN
No. No it doesn’t! Nothing about this makes sense!

I don’t know who that old man was, but John would never hurt Sasha.

TIM
Fine. If it wasn’t him, it must have been that thing we saw.

MARTIN
It was only for a second. And what with that weird finger guy, and the door… I mean, it d-didn’t look like her.

TIM
It did. You know it did. Maybe it ate her. Maybe it was her. Maybe she was always some messed up mutant and we just never noticed. Could have been ‘Michael’. I mean, it basically told us it was working with John. When you disappear and there are more than three different ways you might be dea–

I just do. It’s, it’s my job. I record them.

The job you just lost.

Uh… yes.

GEORGIE
That one you lost so badly it somehow cost you all your stuff?

ARCHIVIST
Well, it’s not quite that simple.

GEORGIE
Well, how am I to know?

ARCHIVIST
Look, Georgie, it’s not… You don’t need to worry. I mean, I’m not, I’m not on drugs or anything.

[GEORGIE LAUGHS DISBELIEVINGLY]
What?

I could be on drugs!

GEORGIE
Sure. I just… I know that you get obsessive about stuff, and this right here, I… I’m guessing someone dragged you into something weird, you got hooked in and then it all went wrong.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, that is almost exactly what happened.

GEORGIE
So what you need now is… distance.

ARCHIVIST
You’re right. You’re right. I just… I need to record it.

GEORGIE
No, you don’t. This [paper rustles] is not going to help. It’s part of the problem, isn’t it? Look me in the eyes and tell me that it’s not part of the cult or whatever the hell it was that left you homeless.

[Sigh] Come on. What’s it been, four days?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[Softer] Yeah.

GEORGIE
It drops through the letter box and you spend four days… like this. It’s not – It isn’t right, John. You don’t sleep…

ARCHIVIST
I’ve been investigating.

GEORGIE
Hmm.

ARCHIVIST
Please, Georgie, I just need… I need to record it. That’s all. Then it’s done.

GEORGIE

Fine. Fine… But you have got to deal with whatever this is.

ARCHIVIST
I will. I, I promise.

Okay. And just so you know: not keen on your weird stalkers knowing my address. Not keen on that.

Right.

Statement of Chloe Ashburt, regarding a new window display at Fanton’s department store in Hammersmith. Original statement given 19th October 2013. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Hea–

Audio recording by Jonathan Sims.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Working in a large department store can be kind of strange. I’ve had jobs in a couple over the last few years, and talked to people who’ve worked in others, and they all seem to operate slightly differently.

Some treat every department almost as a separate business, with its own dedicated team, some move their workforce around regularly, so they don’t get too comfortable. A few operate almost entirely by leasing out spaces to specific companies, like the individual perfume or makeup counters, so you have an array of small, isolated teams on their little island of product.

I personally prefer the second sort, as it gives me an opportunity to work with a lot of different people and products, and I have a tendency to get… bored if everything gets too samey for too long.

So Fanton’s worked pretty well for me, at least at first. I mean, it’s not like customer service is my passion; the public is a moaning, dreadful bunch, but it was only a part-time job to put me through art school, and my colleagues were mostly a decent lot.

What I did enjoy, and what I tried to be involved in every time it came up, were the displays. I was mainly studying illustration, but I’d always had an interest in design more generally, so when the seasons turned and we changed up the displays in the windows and on the shop floor, I always made a point to try and be on the team helping to set them up. My line manager, Lana, knew this and generally let me do so.

I’m not sure I actually sped things up, to be honest. I’m a bit of a perfectionist, and between posing and dressing the mannequins and setting up the props, I think I probably delayed the whole process more than a bit, but everyone was very patient with me as I directed them on how I thought they should assemble the bits I couldn’t easily reach.

I sometimes wonder whether, if I’d left this display alone, or even let Lana do it, things might have turned out differently, but in the end it is what it is, and I’m just going to have to live with it.

This was about a month ago, just as we were starting to put out the autumn displays. These are always my favourites because, aside from the obvious duffle coats and Hallowe’en stuff, the slightly more… unexpected or avant-garde displays tended to be up over the autumn.

The theme for this particular one was ‘Nights at the Circus’. There were acrobat mannequins in hoops, a rather well-made paper maché lion and the centrepiece: a mannequin set up like a ringmistress, dressed in some of the more theatrical clothes that Fanton’s was selling that season.

Topped with a bright red top hat and clutching a whip, it created rather a striking effect; I spent longer than I should have trying to get it absolutely perfect. When it was done, though, I knew it had been worth it. The shiny blank face stared out from below the vivid red, and the hand clutched the whip at such an angle it seemed as though the smooth plastic flesh might leap to life any second with a crack.

There was one other reason I quite enjoyed working at Fanton’s, and that was it gave me ample opportunity to practise my figure drawing. Because of my classes I tended to end up working the later shifts, and Lana would usually let me stay past closing time, where I would spend hours drawing and redrawing each static figure – the different poses and costumes and displays gave me fantastic practise. It was almost meditative. I’ll always be grateful to Lana for letting my do that – a lot of the higher-ups were kind of arseholes about it, hiding behind faux-concern that “my condition made closing up on my own potentially dangerous”, but Lana, to her credit, ignored them and we never had an issue. Well, not that sort of issue, at least.

So obviously, once the ‘Nights at the Circus’ display went up, I spent several evenings drawing and redrawing it, copying every curve of the almost featureless face, the line of the limbs, the poise of the feet, over and over until I got it right. So when I came in one day to find that the ringmistress mannequin had been replaced, I knew instantly. It was wearing the same clothes, certainly, and was posed the same way, but I could see the difference.

If I hadn’t known it in such detail, I never would have noticed. Certainly no-one else mentioned it, and when I asked Lana if there’d been a change, she just gave me a blank look. I was sure, though. The arms were just a little bit longer, the neck ever-so-slightly twisted,and the face, where before there had just been the faintest hint of a nose and a slight smile, was almost completely blank, save for a small patch of broken plastic near its forehead.

Sometime after I had left the previous night, someone must have snuck in, undressed and removed the mannequin already there, and put the clothes on this new one before replacing it in the exact same position. It didn’t make any sense.

I thought about trying to bring more attention to it, but nothing had been stolen, and the changes were so small that, even if I could convince them, what were they going to do about it? So I kept quiet. I was working in the soft furnishings department that week, and the mannequin was down in Womenswear, so I didn’t see it that much. Even so, any time I had an excuse to go past it, I made sure I did. There was something about this new one, something in the way it didn’t quite fit with all the other figures on display, the way it held the whip in cruel, sharp fingers. And the way its head never moved, but somehow I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was watching me right back.

Disconcerting as it was, there wasn’t really anything I could do about it, and after a few days I was starting to get used to the replacement. I had almost convinced myself I was overreacting, if not actually mistaken, when I was called in to Lana’s office, just as I got into work.

Her expression was stern, and she told me to close the door behind me when I came in. She asked me if I’d stayed late the night before, after closing time, and I told her yes I had. I started to talk about what I’d been drawing, but she held up her hand to stop me. She asked if I had done anything other than that, whether I had tried out “any other artistic pursuits”. I was confused and told her as much, and she asked me if I’d seen anyone else there last night and I said no I hadn’t. Then she asked if I’d messed with any of the displays and once again I said no.

She sighed, and I couldn’t tell whether it was in relief or exasperation, but she opened her desk drawer and retrieved some printouts. They were photos of one of the autumn displays. I had noticed on the way in, when I’d gone past that particular window, which had previously been showing off raincoats, I believe, it had been empty. In the picture, however, it was not.

The raincoat mannequin had, it seemed, been… disassembled, then rebuilt into a tangled bunch of limbs and joints. The torso was upside down and the two arms jutted out from the front and back of the pelvis, bending up to hold the mannequin’s head aloft. It had been dressed in an assortment of lurid red and purple shirts from our pyjama range, and someone had clearly stolen some paints from the craft department and daubed a colourful, smiling face on top of the blank space that had previously been there. They had finished it with a red pompom crudely glued onto the top of the head. The effect was alarming and put me in mind of a clown.

I looked up to see Lana’s eyes staring into me, acutely scrutinizing my reaction. The confusion and mild horror on my face seemed to put her a little bit at ease, but she was still a long way from relaxed. I told her it wasn’t me, that I had no idea who would have done it or why, that I definitely didn’t see or hear anything out of the ordinary, all the standard excuses. She nodded, though it was clear nothing I said was really helping the situation. Finally, I asked about CCTV, and she shook her head. There hadn’t been any focused on the vandalised display, and whoever had done it had clearly known enough about the camera placements to avoid them. Another reason, apparently, they suspected it was done by someone who worked there.

We went back and forth for about ten minutes, until at last she said she believed me, and wouldn’t pursue disciplinary action, but without any other credible explanation there was no way she could keep letting me stay behind alone. Not least because, technically, she shouldn’t even have been doing it in the first place. I was upset, of course, but I also realised I was getting off comparatively lightly, so I didn’t make a fuss.

The next couple of weeks were difficult. Drawing the displays in the shop had helped me centre myself, gave me some positive associations with the place. Without it, Fanton’s was just where I worked. And more importantly, somewhere I constantly had to deal with the public, all their rudeness and stupidity and fake pity. To be honest, I was finding it harder and harder to keep my patience.

There was something else, though. Without being able to rely on me to close up, Lana had assigned it on a rota to the others in our team. Nobody really wanted the job, and a few of them moaned to me privately, but they didn’t exactly have a say in the matter. But as the days went by I noticed that some of my colleagues were getting nervous, jumping at little noises and glancing over their shoulder. It always seemed to be the person who’d been closing up the night before. And through it all that ringmistress stood there, malicious and unmoving, brandishing her whip ready to strike.

Finally it happened. Last Wednesday, Lana couldn’t find anyone else to do the last shift, Jan had a doctor’s appointment, Liam had a family emergency… you get the idea. Lana was going to have to do it herself. I’d been working very hard over the days prior to get back in her good graces, and I managed to convince her to let me do the last shift with her, and stick around to do some drawing while she locked up, promising that I’d be out of the door as soon as she was. She reluctantly agreed.

So Wednesday rolled around, and the day went very much as normal, maybe a bit quieter than usual, but not so you’d notice. There was a slight… something in the air though, an anticipation. I thought at the time it was me, since I’d decided to use this opportunity to try and exorcise some of the feelings of unease and finally draw the mannequin that was making me so uncomfortable. But now I don’t think I had anything to do with it at all.

Everything was closed up, everyone else had left. It was just me and Lana. And she was making the final checks to lock up. I ran to the changing rooms and grabbed the small bag from my locker that contained my pencils, inks and paper, and then hurried back and over to the womenswear department. I couldn’t hear Lana anywhere, which is strange as she usually provided something of a running commentary, but I didn’t really notice.

Then I rounded the corner of one of the aisles and stopped dead: the mannequin was gone. The pedestal where the ‘Nights at the Circus’ display had stood was empty, save for a torn pile of paper maché and the headless figure of a plastic acrobat.

I stood there, my mouth hanging open, as I tried to figure out what was going on. Had Lana done this? Was this all some elaborate ploy to frame me for… something, vandalism? That didn’t make any sense. The store around me was still and silent, and it felt as if all I could do was wait for something to happen. And sure enough, after a minute or two, I heard Lana’s voice calling to me.

Except it didn’t sound quite right. There was a strangled, hoarse quality to it, like the words were being pushed out against her will. I was terrified of what I would see when I reached her, but my only other option was to run, and if she was in trouble, I’d never forgive myself. I pulled out my phone and pressed 999, my thumb hovering over the call button as I approached the storeroom where Lana’s voice was coming from. The door’s small window was too high, so I just had to push it open. It was so heavy against my shaking hands.

The room was dark on the other side. I reached up to turn on the lights, but the switch flipped uselessly back and forth. The light from the door illuminated a few boxes of leggings, but I couldn’t bring myself to go any further in. Just beyond the light from the door I could see a figure, tall and thin. It could have been Lana, but I wasn’t sure.

At least until it began to move. Its steps were jerky and stiff, arms snapping out and back as it moved towards me step by step. I felt my own limbs seize up at the sight, and my phone slipped uselessly from my hand. The faceless figure loomed over me, and when it bent down, the finger it placed upon my lips was cold, hard plastic.

“Shhhhh…” it said. Though it had no mouth to form the sound.

The next thing I remember is the police. I must have pressed dial before I dropped my phone. They found what was left of Lana further into the storeroom. I was questioned for a while, but much to the dismay of tabloid headlines everywhere, it became clear quite quickly that there was no way I could have done it. The CCTV showed me almost constantly during the period Lana would have been killed, and the only blood on me was a single, neat line across my lip.

Of course, that’s not to say the police believed my version of events either. They are currently working on the theory that a killer had been stalking the store for a while, and finally chose that night to strike, but they didn’t expect me to still be there, and fled when it was clear I’d called the police. But I know. I remember. Sometimes I wake up in the night, and I can taste the blood and plastic of that stiff and lifeless hand.

Statement ends.

ARCHIVIST
As I have discovered in the few days since this statement arrived, it is far harder to conduct a thorough investigation without the resources of the Institute or the… expertise of my assistants. I have located a few stories about the death of Lana Billings, found… strangled and partially skinned in the storage of Fanton’s department store, but the rather lurid newspaper coverage is as much as I could find, and it gives no further information of use.

Well, that’s not quite true. The Express illustrates their story with a picture of the service entrance to Fanton’s, the entrance the killer is assumed to have used to access the storeroom. I do not know whether this picture was taken before or after the crime, or whether it’s a stock photo, but I cannot help but notice, parked just at the edge, is an off-white delivery van. The resolution is not high enough to make out the name on the side, but I’m not sure I need to.

I’ve had little luck in tracking down Ms. Ashburt herself. I managed to find a legal transcript from 2011 regarding a wrongful dismissal case she brought against a previous employer, the firing she claimed as being motivated by her dwarfism, but none of the parties involved had any up-to-date information on her. Something of a dead end.

There are some connections here, though what they might mean I… I just don’t know. Circuses, skin, things just a few degrees off from human. The mannequin, I would assume, has some connection to this ‘Stranger’ being. The same one we’ve… had such problems with already.

Breekon and Hope… might also be connected to it. I recall they made a delivery to a taxidermy shop in a previous statement, I think, which brings us back to skin. Not to mention more than one witness has described them as… as uncanny, not quite seeming like real people. Until I am more certain of the identities of the other powers out there, I am going to assume Breekon and Hope are at least working with, if not part of, the Stranger.

Of course, the biggest mystery to this statement is who sent it to me. And why? There’s no return address and, something I’m glad Georgie didn’t spot, no postmark. Which means it was delivered by hand. Does someone from the Institute know where I am, or is it someone else?

And why this statement? It links in with a lot of what I’m already looking into, but if there are any revelations in it, I can’t find them. Or is it a warning? Emphasising that if I simply wait and see what happens, if I don’t act on what I know, then someone I care about may pay the price. If that’s the case, then I think… message received. Hiding won’t bring any answers, and it won’t stop whatever’s going on. I’m going to keep looking into where this statement came from, but it wasn’t sent in vain. [Sigh] I’ve got work to do.

MARTIN
Right. Er, Martin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording statement number… 9900112, statement of Adrian Weiss, given December 1st 1990.

Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
When I was about ten or eleven, my parents moved us from Ipswich out to a small village in Suffolk called Cratfield. I’d tell you what the nearest notable town was, but there really wasn’t one. Nothing much near us at all. It was open and rural and, the way I saw it, absolutely filthy. I was used to the dirt and grime of a city, so all that manure and rot that gave the countryside it’s particular odour made me feel like I could never quite get clean.

Still, I was happy enough to be living there. My school in Ipswich had been very difficult, for reasons I’d rather not discuss, and I had no friends to speak of that I was leaving behind. For all the isolation and muck out there, I still felt like I appreciated the fresh start.

The village kids were an insular lot, but they accepted me much quicker than I had expected. I guess they couldn’t really be picky – a place that small, you end up hanging out with all sorts of kids that you wouldn’t normally look twice at.

That’s how I met Gordon. Gordon Goodman. He never really felt like he fit the name. He was about fourteen, a bit older than most of the other kids by a couple of years, but still one of the smallest, barely five foot two and scrawny as anything. His hair fell over his eyes, and you always had to ask him to repeat himself, because whenever he started talking it was so quiet that you’d miss the first part. I liked him, though. He wasn’t someone who’d judge you; he just took everything in stride.

Now, near the edge of Cratfield, at least as much as it had a clear edge, was a field of about three acres that pretty much everyone avoided. It wasn’t the sort of place that gets named on a map, so everyone around just called it ‘The Dump’, or occasionally ‘Maggie’s Dump’ on account of an old woman called Margaret Carnegie, who owned the place and lived in a small bungalow right in the middle of it. Now Maggie was a classic recluse: hardly anyone had seen her for years, and those that had would only spot her in and around her little house, carefully piling up newspapers or stacking bottles.

Maggie was a hoarder, you see. No-one really knew where she got most of it, you didn’t get much home delivery in those days, but she seemed to have a never-ending supply of food wrappers and magazines and old clothes. At some point she’d clearly run out of space in her bungalow, and started to store stuff outside. She never weighed it down or tied it up or anything, so when the wind picked up it got spread all over the place, and so, gradually, the area became Maggie’s dump.

Cratfield was a good ways away from the nearest actual rubbish tip, so it wasn’t long before local families started to use it as well. Anything too big for normal collection got thrown out there: fridges, sofas, broken electrics. By the time I moved there, the area around Old Maggie’s house was covered in junk, with stained white, broken appliances, dotted all over like blisters on grimy skin.

I learned all this from the other kids when they made fun of Gordon, who they called Maggie’s ‘little pet’ or sometimes her ‘rat butler’. You see, he was the one who delivered her food. I’ve no idea why his parents had taken on the responsibility of providing for her, she was probably a distant relation of some sort, but it was Gordon’s job to bring her groceries every few days, winding his way through the filth that surrounded her isolated home.

Now Old Maggie fascinated me. Or rather, the stories about her did, because obviously there were stories. The two most common were that she was a witch, or that she’d killed her husband and chopped him up, keeping the land as messy as possible so nobody would think to dig him up. I never met anyone in town who remembered her actually having a husband, or course, but there were plenty of kids who claimed to have seen her creeping past their houses at night, or staring into their windows. Davey Morgan even said that she’d chased him through the woods with a knife, but we all knew he was a liar. Even so, the stories terrified me, and I loved them.

I never wanted to actually meet Maggie. I was far too scared of her for that. But, I used to love walking with Gordon while he took groceries to her. I’d see how close to her house I could get before I got spooked and ran home. I used the bigger bits of rubbish as markers. After a few weeks I could always make it past the broken red sofa, and the bravest I got was the washing machine without a drum, all the while picking my way past sodden newspaper and rusted cans.

Gordon, for his part, never seemed to mind. I reckon he was thankful for the company, as he would chat away softly to me as we walked, either ignoring or oblivious to my fear.

Whenever I ran back to the fencepost that marked the start of Maggie’s Dump, and was therefore, in my mind, safe, I would turn back to watch as Gordon reached the bungalow. He’d press the little doorbell, and stand there waiting as the door swung open. I could see a figure stood there: long, white hair and a dressing gown the colour of rust. They would lead Gordon inside, and the door would shut behind them. I would never see him come back out.

I tried to convince myself he just needed to help her with chores, but deep down I knew she was doing something dreadful to him. My mind would conjure grotesque images of knives and bubbling cauldrons full of rotting food, and I’d generally scare myself so badly that I never ended up waiting for more than ten minutes.

Which, thinking about it now, is probably why I didn’t see him come out. But, he was always at school the next day, alive and unharmed. He’d just smile when I asked him what he did in there. He’d shrug and say she just wanted to ask him to stack stuff, but on those days I would notice that his fingernails were always stained, and slightly caked in dirt.

Then, one day in early October, Gordon didn’t show up at school the next day. I’d walked with him the evening before, but I hadn’t even made it to the washing machine. I’d seen him go inside, and now he was gone. Nobody seemed bothered, and one teacher said his parents had called him in sick, but I was certain: this time Old Maggie hadn’t let him go.

I ran over to his house as soon as school finished, and knocked on the door. His father answered, and when I asked him where Gordon was, he told me he was up in his room with a fever. I asked to see him, but was told very firmly that he was asleep. I looked Gordon’s dad in the eyes as he said this, and I knew that he was lying to me. If anyone was going to save him from Maggie’s knife, it was going to have to be me.

The sun had almost set by the time I reached The Dump, and the bungalow seemed much taller, silhouetted as it was against the darkening purple sky, surrounded by the filthy, white corpses of unwanted electricals. But that wasn’t right. Maggie wanted them. Maggie didn’t want anything to be lost. She wanted them to stay, and rot.

You know, for all the fear Maggie inspired in me, I was completely unprepared to be right about her. Not the knife, I got the knife wrong, but I do think that she was a witch. In the years since then I’ve tried very hard to convince myself that what I saw that night was a dream or a false memory or something, but… it wasn’t.

I was past the washing machine before I’d even registered what I was doing, and when I realised where I was, I felt my legs begin to seize up. The lights in the house were on, dim through the filthy windows, and they cast a diseased yellow glow that refracted off a pile of clear glass bottles stacked outside. I don’t know how I’d never noticed the smell of that place before, but now the stench of it hit me like a wave. I gagged, and fell to my knees, not wanting to put my hands anywhere on the litter-covered ground.

As I looked around desperately for a patch of actual grass which I could use to support myself, my eyes fell on something that seemed out of place: A pristine, unopened can of baked beans. The absurdity of it overcame my fear for just a second, and I steadied myself enough to get a closer look.

It stood upright, about two feet from a fallen grocery bag. One of the bags that Gordon always brought when he went to see Old Maggie. Behind it was another bag, and another, and another, until I saw, propped up against the back of the house, dozens, if not hundreds, of shopping bags. Some seemed to be almost new, while others had clearly been there for months. And all of them were full to the brim with unopened food.

I found myself reaching for the tin. I just wanted to touch it, to feel something clean and real to make sure I was still in the world. But as my fingers brushed against it, the can began to shake violently. The metal bent and warped, like something inside was growing rapidly, bursting to be free. I fell backwards, now fully panicked, and started to crawl away as quickly as I could. The throbbing tin was nowhere to be seen now, but as I tried to get away, I felt the ground give way beneath my hand, and it was sucked down, up to the elbow in clinging muck.

Somehow, I managed to choke down a scream, and pulled my arm free, ripping soil and dead grass out in clumps. It was covered in a wriggling mass of earthworms, squeezing and pressing their slimy bodies against my skin. Still, I didn’t scream, as I shook my arm wildly, flinging them away from me. My head was swimming, searching for something I could focus on, something normal, if only for a second.

What I saw instead was Gordon’s face, staring at me from the mud, from the hole I had torn in the ground. His eyes were vacant, and his skin was marked and discoloured. Then I realised with a start that it was a mask, old newspaper and wet cardboard formed into a perfect recreation of my friend. A fleshy knot of worms slithered through the hole of its mouth. And then, all at once, my mind snapped back to Gordon’s plight, to why I was there in that awful place.

The light was still shining through the grime of the bungalow windows, as I gingerly placed my foot on a pile of old newspapers and lifted myself up to get a look inside. My fingers gripped the edges of a windowpane slick with some sort of dark oil. It took a moment for my eyes to focus on the figures inside, and even then they were blurred by the slime-encrusted glass.

I could see Gordon, sat in a thick, threadbare armchair, motionless. Bent over him was the thin, hunched form of Old Maggie. Tiny shapes moved over my friend’s still form, as her thin hands smoothed pieces of ancient, yellowed paper over his face. Her dressing gown was wet, and her wrinkled skin glistened with a pale fluid that dripped from her fingers as she smoothed the strips in place. I could hear her singing a soft, crooning song, and as her voice got louder the things crawling over Gordon got faster and more agitated.

Then my foot slipped, and a glass bottle fell from its pile. It wasn’t loud. It didn’t even break. But that was all the excuse I needed to run. I don’t know if she heard it, the mere idea that she might see me was enough to send me sprinting all the way back home to safety. When my mum saw the state of my clothes, she sent me to bed without dinner, which was fine by me. I crawled under the covers and lay there until sleep finally came.

Gordon was fine. He was in school the next day like nothing had happened, and we never spoke about it. He stopped delivering to Old Maggie, though. At least, I think he did. I lost touch with him about a year later, when my family moved again, this time to Liverpool. And I tried to convince myself that it had all been a dream.

I’d almost managed it, as well, until I found myself in Ipswich last month on business. My drive home took me near to Cratfield, so I decided to pass through for old time’s sake. I stopped at the White Hart for a coffee, and ended up chatting with some locals.

We talked about nothing for an hour or so, until someone mentioned offhand about having to swing by the dump with their old mattress. I asked him when Cratfield had gotten a dump, and he explained it was actually just a patch of old waste ground where folk tossed their rubbish.

Did it have a name, I asked, and he nodded, casually, like he had no idea that what he was saying mattered in the least. Sure, he told me, it was named for the weird recluse who owned the place. They called it “Gordie’s Dump”.

Statement ends.

MARTIN
[RAGGED BREATHING AS MARTIN REGAINS HIS COMPOSURE]
Well, I, er… I think that was okay. Er, yeah. To anyone listening, sorry about the change of tone.

John, the, uh, Head Archivist is… absent, so I’ll be trying to fill in as best as I can. Um. Maybe Tim as well, if he… if he feels like it. It, It doesn’t matter, I suppose. Just as long as it gets done.

Erm, I fol– We followed up on the address provided by Adrian Weiss, and… it… is a pretty unpleasant piece of land, owned by Gordon Goodman. Records show he was bequeathed it by the last owner, Miss Margaret Carnegie, upon her death in 1982. Er, in fact he was her sole beneficiary, it looks like.

Miss Carnegie’s death was listed as ‘natural causes’, most likely pneumonia, but it was apparently hard to be sure given the state of her body. Her lungs seemed to be full of newspaper pulp, and her back and sides covered in… you see, well, the report lists them as “cancerous growths”, but the description… I mean, I mean, they sound more like insect legs. It also describes them as having “significant post-mortem autonomous motor function”, which I’m guessing means they were somehow still moving.

Gordon Goodman is on record as the one who identified her body, and the corpse went missing the following night. Which leads me to wonder if maybe he didn’t want to let her go, either. I mean… maybe he, um…

Oh, er, h-hold on.

[Distant] Er, excuse me? Excuse me!

[DOOR OPENS]
MELANIE
Oh, yes, hello?

MARTIN
This is… The Archives aren’t actually open to the public.

MELANIE
Er, I know. There, there wasn’t anyone on the door, though. I’m… I’m looking for the Archivist?

MARTIN
Ah. You’re Miss, er… Richardson?

MELANIE
King.

MARTIN
King! Yes. Right.

MELANIE
Melanie is fine. Is he here?

MARTIN
Are, are… Oh, are you alright?

MELANIE
Oh, um, no. Not really. Got shot. Sort of. In India.

MARTIN
What?

MELANIE
Oh, it’s, it’s mostly fine now. I can walk on it, at least… It’s what I wanted to talk to John about.

MARTIN
That’s… not really… I mean, I guess I could take your statement?

MELANIE
Oh. Er. I suppose. You mean, you mean now?

Right.

[DOOR CLOSES]
Um, well… I… I flew out and I’ve been, well, that is, before that I was, I was looking at some books. Er, there were history books that were talking… Look, are you sure I can’t just talk to John? You know, Jonathan Sims? He still works here, right?

MARTIN
Er, that’s actually quite a good question.

MELANIE
Oh, okay. Look, I’m sorry, I’ve… I’ve obviously missed something here. What’s going on?

MARTIN
[Long sigh] John’s missing. And they… they think he killed someone.

MELANIE
[Short laugh] What, he finally snapped, did he? Or did he accidentally bore them to death?

MARTIN
I’m serious.

MELANIE
Oh. Oh right.

So, who’d he kill?

MARTIN
He didn’t! It’s just everyone –

Look, it was, it was an old man. No-one here knows him, and the police still can’t actually identify the body, so…

MELANIE
So… what? He’s supposed to have suddenly just murdered some stranger?

MARTIN
With a pipe.

MELANIE
What, like burned him to death, or…?

MARTIN
A metal pipe.

MELANIE
Oh! Sorry, I just pictured him with like a smoking… y’know? I mean, that, that doesn’t sound like him, does it? I’ve only met him a couple of times, but beating an old man to death with a pipe seems kind of out of character.

MARTIN
Right? But everyone just seems totally convinced he did it. I mean, they think he did something to Sasha too.

MELANIE
Jesus. Which one?

MARTIN
Oh, uh, she was, um, another one of the research assistants, like me and Tim.

MELANIE
Yes, I know that, I meant –

MARTIN
She vanished around the same time as the murder, I think.

MELANIE
Oh, you know what, I am not doing this again.

MARTIN
You sure you’re alright?

MELANIE
Yes! I just got… God, I’m kind of at the end, you know?

MARTIN
The end of what?

MELANIE
Everything. Friends, clues, savings. Everything. Options. There’s nowhere left for me to go. I don’t know why, but… I just, I just felt that perhaps coming here might help. And talking things out with John. I mean, I mean he’s awful, but at least he listens, you know?

MARTIN
Yeah. I’m… sorry. Um, is there anything that I could, like, maybe do for you?

[DOOR OPENS]
ELIAS
[Distant] A friend of yours?

MARTIN
Oh, er, it’s okay. She’s, um, er, she’s giving a statement.

ELIAS
[Coming closer] I see. Well, good to meet you.

Elias Bouchard, I run the Institute.

MELANIE
Melanie King.

ELIAS
Ah, you’re not the Melanie King who runs Ghost Hunt UK, surely?

MELANIE
Used to.

ELIAS
Ah, of course. My apologies.

MARTIN
[Disbelievingly] You used to watch it?

ELIAS
I’m sorry to hear it’s no longer running. Your techniques were rudimentary, but you showed surprising promise. On occasion.

MELANIE
Thank you… I think.

MARTIN
[Spluttering] Melanie was actually just leaving. Erm, I think we were done.

MELANIE
Uh, yes… yes.

ELIAS
One moment, Miss King. Martin has filled you in on recent events, I believe?

MELANIE
I mean, a, a bit.

MARTIN
Not everything.

ELIAS
Then you are aware there is currently a vacancy for an archival assistant?

MELANIE
Yes. And an archivist.

ELIAS
Oh, I don’t think we need to worry about that just yet. But the assistant role…

MELANIE
Hang on, are you offering me a job?

MARTIN
What?

ELIAS
You have some experience in the field, I believe.

MELANIE
Well, yes, but…

MARTIN
I mean, that doesn’t actually, er, make her qualified.

ELIAS
[Pointedly] Formal qualifications aren’t everything, Martin.

Do you want the job, Melanie?

MELANIE
Oh… Um, I… Well, it’s, it’s rather sudden, but… er, I mean, sure. Yes. Yes, I do.

MARTIN
Melanie, I’m really not sure that you actually want to –

ELIAS
Problem, Martin?

MARTIN
No, er, no, no, I-I guess not.

ELIAS
Good. Well, if you want to come on up to my office and we’ll have a proper interview. Hopefully get all the paperwork signed.

MELANIE
Lead the way.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of an unknown figure, regarding an encounter that… may or may not have happened in their home. Date of original statement unclear, though paper quality likely puts it at between twenty and thirty years ago. Recording by Jonathan Sims… in his personal investigative capacity.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to put my words to you, and apologies for any problems that… may arise from this conversation. I will try to restrain it.

Are you familiar with the work of the poet William Hughes Mearns? I assume not. Few people are, even now I’m not completely sure that’s how you pronounce his name, having only ever seen it written down. There is one poem, however, I think you will be familiar with. It goes thus:

As I was going up the stair

I met a man who wasn’t there!

He wasn’t there again today,

Oh how I wish he’d go away!

When I came home last night at three,

The man was waiting there for me

But when I looked around the hall,

I couldn’t see him there at all!

Go away, go away, don’t you come back any more!

Go away, go away, and please don’t slam the door…

Last night I saw upon the stair,

A little man who wasn’t there,

He wasn’t there again today

Oh, how I wish he’d go away…

It’s called Antigonish, named after a town in Nova Scotia, home to the ghost of an old man who supposedly haunted the staircases of one of the grander homes. For the longest time I misread the title, and was convinced the poem was called ‘Antagonish’. I thought it was a rather clever play on the word ‘antagonist’, owing to the ambiguous nature of the subject.

I was disappointed, then, to discover it was simply a reference to a haunting. By tying it to a real place and a known story, the strange, disconcerting nonsense at the heart of it was lost. Because nonsense is what it is. It is playfully impossible. He cannot be not there. But he is. He was. And so am I.

I didn’t meet him on the staircase as well. The carpet didn’t bend under the weight of his soft, round body, and I distinctly recall the absence of a creak as his foot pressed on the loose board of the empty fifth step. He laughed, but there was no humour it, because… then it would have had to break the silence. In the poem, I had always imagined a translucent figure, absent in life and body, but visible. But I couldn’t see this man. Obviously I couldn’t. I couldn’t see him or hear him or speak to him. Because… there was nobody there. The staircase was empty, as he stretched his arm to gesture me closer.

My memory is not what it was. Some days it seems that damn poem is all I can remember. I know I had a family. I know I had a house. Was it in Antigonish? No, that’s absurd. The man I didn’t meet had nothing to do with the poem, just a, a coincidence. But I’m not sure… what else I know now; I’m not sure where else I know now. And I’m unsure where I’ve ever been. I had a home. A house. I know it had at least two floors, because there were stairs. The stairs were real. He wasn’t there, but the stairs were. At least to begin with.

It was dark when I didn’t see him, and I was about to walk up to bed. I remember being cold, damp. Had it been raining? No, the water was still. I wanted to be dry, to be warm in my bed. And I couldn’t, because in spite of his own absence, this man blocked the stairs. I think I would have asked others to tell me what or who they might or might not have seen, if that had been an option, and I didn’t, so I must have lived alone. I don’t know why the lights were off, but the moon was bright and cast stark shadows upon the empty floor where this figure stood.

For obvious reasons I can’t describe him. I can barely describe his absence. I could try to say that his… hypothesis was tall and wide. Conceptually, he could have had arms that stretched away from a soft-looking torso, with stubby fingers that did not grip the banisters tight enough to splinter. If he had had a face, it would have been unremarkable, with a small, plump mouth that failed to quite turn into a smile.

He didn’t speak, so I couldn’t hear his offer to join him on the staircase. But I accepted. I don’t know if I was just desperate to try and get up and into my bed, or if I was… generally curious as to what this man had to offer me, when he didn’t even have enough wherewithal to exist. So I placed my foot on the first step and I began to walk. If he’d been there it might have been hard to get past his bulk, but as it was I continued up without any problems.

The staircase in my house was not long, and it wasn’t steep, and it went straight up to the landing with only a single right angle turn. It was not a spiral staircase, so after walking down that corkscrew for almost a half hour, I knew it couldn’t be mine. The man hadn’t come with me, of course, so I wasn’t able to ask how it was he could always stay three steps in front of me without once moving his legs.

I walked and I walked. And then I didn’t walk, and that got me moving much faster. The walls didn’t look like my house, because there weren’t any, so it was hard to tell what they did look like. Eventually I must have reached the end, because I woke up the next morning in my bed, and my bed was at the end of the staircase that was there, so I assume it was also at the end of the one that wasn’t.

The next few days are hard for me to remember, because they happened, and genuine recollections slip through my mind like rippling glass. But the man didn’t come back. He didn’t come back every night. He didn’t come back until I made… a horrid mistake. I called to him. I stood on the landing and shouted at him to go away. I asked him if he was there. I demanded he show himself. All utterly impossible, of course. I was shouting at nobody but myself, and so it was into my own mind that my curses and pleas burrowed and nested. As he wasn’t there, I have no way of telling how many teeth were on show when he smiled at me.

After that, it became hard to tell where he failed to begin, and easier to tell where I ended. People would forget me, but that was alright, because only real people care about who remembers them. And I was no longer among their number. I would have whole days where I failed to exist, a feeling so entirely alien that I am glad I had no stomach from which to throw up. And as I existed less and less, the man ceased to exist less and less… until… I remember the first time he was really in my house, and I wished for nothing more than that I had hands with which to strangle him.

My parents were the worst. They came for dinner once, shortly after I had called to him. They looked so confused when I served them their meal, and the conversations would die after only a few words. My mother’s eyes were bloodshot, and I could see them unfocus when they tried to look at me. She dabbed a napkin at her mouth and asked me where her son was. I asked her what his name had been. She didn’t know. She dabbed her mouth again and the napkin came away bloody.

My father said nothing, as I had taken him up the stairs an hour before, and he now lay dead in his chair, his heart unsuited for the expedition. He had sworn at me as he tried to climb them to the top, telling me I was no son of his, and I was trying to agree with him, but if I could have done so, then he would have been wrong. Eventually, after almost an hour descending the spiral, he keeled over in his seat and lay lifeless. My mother got abruptly to her feet, and told my father that they were leaving. My father got to his feet, and silently followed her out. I never saw either of them again.

Eventually, the man who had never set foot upon my staircase became real enough to have done this to me. He existed so thoroughly that he was finally able to laugh at the joy of being. He looked around for me, but of course I wasn’t there, and in my absence I watched the realisation on his face that, in reality, whoever he was, he had died decades before. And he was now in reality. He tried to scream, but his throat decomposed around the noise, cutting it short with a slough of rotten flesh and collapsing, brittle bone. And as I stared from the empty spiral staircase, I wanted to laugh right back at him. But I couldn’t, because I just wasn’t there.

I haven’t been here for a long time now. Time is difficult. I try to take people up the staircase. Sometimes they make it, sometimes they do not. None of them have called out to me, though. Not like I once called out to an empty house. Most staircases are easy for me to not be on, but this one here took effort. I tried to be just real enough to talk to you. I wanted to share. I, I don’t want to take you up the spiral staircase, so you should try to leave. I don’t want to, but it’s my nature now, and you can’t fight what you are. Or even what you aren’t.

As I was going up the stair,

I was a man who wasn’t there.

I wasn’t there again today.

Oh, how I wish I’d go away.

Statement ends.

ARCHIVIST
There are many aspects of this statement that I desperately want more information on, but I have no real way to do so. There are some short pieces of correspondence in the file, addressed to Gertrude, from someone called Eric Delano, confirming that while he typed out this statement, he has no memory of doing so, and requesting some sick leave to address persistent migraines he has developed. There’s no supplementary research because… what do you research? A nonsense poem from 1922?

No, I am more interested, as before, with who is sending me these statements, and why this one, especially as the message, if indeed there is one, seems to contradict the last one. If the… ‘moral’, shall we say, of Ms. Ashburt’s statement was that ignoring the horrors stalking you just makes them more dangerous, then surely the message of this one is that confronting them directly is even more so. I suppose that leaves skulking around the periphery. Which is what I was already doing!

There is, of course, a different reading, which is that this is a targeted warning about trusting Michael, given the obvious parallels: swap out stairways for corridors and spirals for fractals, and there you go. The Nowhere Man thing is new, though. What was it Leitner said about the Spiral? It deals with fooling your senses, drawing your mind into difficult paths, making you doubt the reality you live in.

Well, if this is a warning about Michael, then it is, as before, somewhat superfluous. If I never see him – if I never see it again, it’s too soon.

Maybe that’s it. It. Maybe whoever sent this wants me to consider how many of these creatures used to be people. How many seem to have taken the mantle from the ones that came before them, and how none of them have been able to overcome their new natures. How most of them don’t even seem to think like people anymore. Given that there is every possibility I’ve taken one of these mantles myself, this is not an interpretation I’m keen on.

Or it could be someone in the Archives randomly sending me statements, with no curation, rhyme or reason. Assuming they come from the Archives. They’re marked as Institute statements, but I have no idea who’s sending them. I feel like I’ve been seeing a lot of police cars about, maybe… no, that’s absurd. Maybe Leitner stole a lot of statements and had a, a sort of dead man’s switch to… [sigh] Occam’s Razor. For now, it makes sense to assume they’re coming from the Institute, and they’re only coming one at a time, so I will work on the belief that they are some way curated. So the current questions are who and why.

I feel bad staying put, like… like I might be placing Georgie in danger, but I don’t have anywhere else to go at the moment, and if the increased police presence isn’t just in my head, then I don’t –

[DOOR OPENS]
GEORGIE
Right, I’m out tonight, ok? There should be some stuff in the freezer if you… Oh.

ARCHIVIST
I was just, uh…

GEORGIE
You didn’t say we got another one.

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t want to worry you.

GEORGIE
I knew it was something. You’ve been weird all day.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry, I… I don’t know.

GEORGIE
Yeah. Well, we can talk about it later. I need to head out.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. Yeah, y… you look great. What’s the occasion?

GEORGIE
I have a date.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Oh! Do you need me to get out of the house for the night?

GEORGIE
[Laughs] Oh, no. Trust me, nothing’s happening tonight.

ARCHIVIST
Oh… How are you so sure?

GEORGIE
Check out his profile.

ARCHIVIST

Good lord.

GEORGIE
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, he does know what a book is, right?

GEORGIE
Unclear. He climbs mountains, though.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, I got that. “Face to face with your own mortality on the frozen peaks, staring death in the face and saying ‘Not today, dude.’” The man’s a poet. And… why are you going out with him again?

GEORGIE
He, uh… he likes Hungarian food. And there’s place just opened.

ARCHIVIST
You’re serious? You’re going on a date with… the Dullard of Skull Mountain, just so you have an excuse to eat a shopska salad?

GEORGIE
I need my sheep’s cheese, John. No one else will go with me. You hate Hungarian food. Jeff says it tastes too “Soviet”, apparently, whatever that means. Melanie says it’s too salty. Everyone I know has bad taste in food.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t hate Hungari–

Hold on. Melanie’s back?

GEORGIE
You didn’t hear?

ARCHIVIST
Hear what?

GEORGIE
Yeah, she… had a bad time in India. She got shot.

ARCHIVIST
She… what?

GEORGIE
Yeah, I know.

ARCHIVIST
Is she –

I, I mean, she survived?

GEORGIE
I hope so. I’m going for a drink with her on Thursday. Be a bit awkward if not.

ARCHIVIST
Right…

GEORGIE
I’d take you along but, y’know, she thinks you’re a dick.

ARCHIVIST
Another startling insight from the piercing investigative mind of Georgie Barker. Is she alright?

GEORGIE
Well, she’s had a hell of a time. Figured the least I could do was get her drunk and listen to her bitch about the new job.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, she found something, then?

GEORGIE
Yeah. Didn’t say what. I think she was a bit embarrassed, says her co-workers are super weird.

ARCHIVIST
Really? Really. Well, er, speaking of weirdos, I think you have a Hungarian mountain man to be courting.

GEORGIE
Yes I do. I’ll see you later. Don’t forget the freezer.

I won’t. Have fun.

Melanie King?

TIM
I know who you are.

MELANIE
I… Did Martin not explain?

TIM
Yeah. Yeah, you work here now.

MELANIE
You sound thrilled.

TIM
It’s not you. It’s his fault. He didn’t warn you properly, and now you’re trapped here. With us.

MELANIE
Oh, is this, this whole ‘you can’t quit because of spooky magic’ deal?

TIM
Yeah. You tried?

MELANIE
No. And I’m not going to. I need a job, and it’s fine here. I like it. It’s quiet.

TIM
Sure. If you ignore all the corpses. And the monsters. And the disappearances.

MELANIE
Oh, trust me, you’ll find plenty of those elsewhere. If this whole ‘give quitting a try’ thing is meant to be some kind of subtle hint… I… I just feel like you two don’t want me here.

TIM
We don’t. Martin’s not big on change. I don’t want anyone to be here.

MELANIE
Well, thanks for making me feel like part of the team.

TIM
You’re suspicious and resentful, right? Welcome aboard.

MELANIE
Good talk.

TIM
Wait. Tell me about the two Sashas.

MELANIE
Oh? What?

TIM
Martin said you were rambling about there being two Sashas.

MELANIE
Look, I don’t, I don’t know, I… um, well, the… the first time I came to give a statement, there was a young woman working here named Sasha, er, and then when I, when I came in again there was a different woman working here. And everyone called her Sasha as well, which… I didn’t think it was too strange. I mean, i-i-it’s a common name, but everyone kept saying they were the same person and, and they weren’t. At all! John kept saying there’d only ever been one Sasha working there, but they were totally different. And everyone’s been giving me really strange looks whenever I talk about it.

TIM

What did she look like?

MELANIE
What? Sorry?

So, uh… marker!

[SHE CLAPS]
Right. Here we go. Er…

MELANIE (STATEMENT)
My parents never let me have a night light. I was always afraid, but they were just that sort of stubborn which doubled down when I screamed or cried about something, instead of actually listening. So no matter how terrified I might have been, I would always end up sleeping in the dark.

I don’t know why it was such a cornerstone of their vision to see me grow up strong, but even an adult they would tell me how they “helped me get over my fear of the dark”. It was such a point of pride for them that I could never bring myself to tell them, to say that the fear never really went away. I’ve heard that being exposed to the source of your terror over and over again can help break its power over you, numb you to it, but in my experience it just teaches you to hide from it. Sometimes that might mean hiding in a quiet corner of your mind, but sometimes it’s literally a blanket.

It wasn’t a specific blanket, either. I didn’t have it from childhood, or carry it for security; it was just whatever was on my bed. Thin summer sheet or thick duvet, it didn’t matter, as long as I could duck my head underneath it and curl into a ball, I was fine. Weirdly, the fact it was still pitch black when I was underneath those covers didn’t bother me a bit. The darkness beneath the blankets was my darkness: it was warm and cosy. I trusted it. But that cold, hateful gloom waiting just beyond the thin wall of my sanctuary never really left my mind.

Eventually I grew up, like pretty much everyone, and as the years passed I forgot my childhood fear. The blanket was just there to keep me warm. Until last week.

The mother of an old friend of mine, Robin Patton, called me out of the blue. Now, at that point I hadn’t really seen Robin in about three years, but she sounded close to panic so I listened. She told me she hadn’t heard from him in almost a month, and was convinced something terrible had happened to her son. Apparently he lived alone, and I was the closest friend to Robin’s address. She begged me to go over, and see if anything was wrong.

I feel a bit guilty about how long I put off going, although in the end I guess it didn’t matter. Robin and I hadn’t parted on bad terms or anything, he was just a bit dull, and I had no real wish to bring him back into my life. Still, I couldn’t not check on him, not after that phone call. So, eventually, I drove the half hour over to his cheerful suburban bungalow.

It was almost evening by the time I got out, and as I walked up to the front door I noticed that none of the windows were lit. I was reassured, though, when I saw a shape watching me from the kitchen. I couldn’t really make it out, and it disappeared almost as soon as I’d seen it, but I managed to convince myself that it was Robin, probably wondering why I’d shown up at his door unannounced. I kept telling myself there was no reason to feel so uneasy. When I reached the front door, I saw it was open, and shadows spilled out of it like paint.

It wasn’t open so wide that you could have seen it from the street, but it was immediately clear that something was very wrong with Robin Patton, and I already regretted getting involved. I expected the door to creak when I pulled it, but the hinges moved in complete silence. Inside, everything was gloomy, lit only by a few stray beams of sunset that had managed to slip in past the heavy curtains. There was no sign of any figure watching from the window, but something in the light made the shadows seem as if they were moving. Forwards and backwards, shifting to a beat that only they could hear. I fumbled for a moment or two, looking for a light switch, until I was able to flick the ceiling lights on and the shadows retreated back to where they should have been.

Inside, the place was an absolute mess. Robin had never been a tidy guy, but it looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in weeks. A thin film of dust coated everything, and there was this rancid smell pervading the place, that I thought must have been coming from the fridge. On the wall hung a calendar, still pinned to January. From the looks of things, he hadn’t been living there in over a month. I was about to head out, and find a phone somewhere to call Robin’s mother, and then maybe the police, when I caught another glimpse of movement. I saw through a crack in one of the doors that lead further into the house. This time it was a slow, languid motion, and I was absolutely sure that I’d seen it.

I called out for Robin, or for anyone who might be in there to respond, but I got nothing but that same thick silence. My heart was thumping so hard I could feel my legs shake as I approached the door. I pushed it open, and reached for a light switch on the wall. I found it, turned it on and… nothing happened. The room remained completely black, and for the first time in almost twenty years I began to feel that childish fear of the dark.

Thankfully, I always keep a heavy torch in the car, in case I break down somewhere at night, so I went to fetch it. The weight in my hand was reassuring and solid, as I walked slowly back and into the darkened room. In the light I could see this was Robin’s bedroom. There was a small writing desk covered with papers, a large oak closet, a single bed missing its covers, and a door to a small en suite bathroom in the corner. As I went in, I noticed the dust in here wasn’t as thick as in the rest of the house, and that the last entry marked on his desktop calendar was the 12th of February. Empty food packets and bottles were strewn about the room and piled up in the corner. It looked as though Robin hadn’t left his bedroom in weeks. The rancid odour that I’d caught wind of outside was stronger in here, and I no longer thought it was coming from the fridge.

Slowly and carefully I made my way towards the wardrobe. It was a stark, imposing thing: a good two feet taller than I was. The smell was making my eyes water, but I pushed through. Even if I knew what I was going to find inside, I felt like I had to open it, if only so I could accurately describe it to the police. So that’s what I did. I gripped the ice-cold brass handle, took as deep a breath as I could endure, and opened the door to the closet.

The shape that slid out did not, at first, resemble anything I would have called human. It looked like a large, wet bag, glistening and slick, with a dark liquid that oozed from it onto the floor. I won’t even try to describe the smell. It was only when I saw a shrivelled, nearly skeletal hand gripping the edge of the bag from the inside that I realised what I was actually looking at.

It was Robin, but when he had climbed into that cupboard he had taken the sheets from his bed. He had wrapped them tightly around himself as he sat in there, clutching them in what I can only assume was mortal terror. And now, in death, they had fused to him, his own putrefying fluids mixing with whatever gross liquid had soaked into that thick fabric. How long had he sat there waiting? Hours? Days? Had it been since the 12th, two weeks before I had come to check on him?

And as I stood there, in utter horror, the growing pool of dark liquid touched the tip of my shoe. That’s it. That’s the moment that I believe it started for me. I don’t know why particularly that moment fixates me, that there must have been dozens of other ways I called attention to myself. But even so, whenever I look back, I cannot shake the conviction that it was that moment I sealed my fate. Because I didn’t watch where I put my feet.

I called the police at that point. They were very understanding, although once a search turned up nothing they didn’t pay any attention to my insistence someone else had been in the house. For all the strangeness of it, there didn’t seem to be any actual evidence of foul play, so I was really just offered some condolences, and sent on my way. They were the ones that called Robin’s mother in the end, and to be honest I’m glad. I don’t really think I could have handled that conversation.

And then it was over. Nothing for me to do but go home, and try to process what I was feeling, what I had seen in that dusty bungalow. And I thought I was doing okay. At least while the daylight held. But that night it came for me.

I woke up at 2:40 in the morning. I don’t know why. There was no sound to disturb me, just a sudden and urgent need to no longer be sleeping. And as I opened my eyes I felt that old fear of the dark hit me again with such force my muscles began to seize up. I raised my head just enough to get a clear view of the door to my room, and I saw what I somehow knew I was going to see.

It was impossible to make out any details of the form that stood in the doorway, it was simply a patch of shadow even darker than the night that surrounded it. A silhouette in the pitch black. At first I thought it was a trick of my eyes adjusting to the dark, but then it began to move. Its body was fat and bulbous, with no limbs or head, so when it came towards me it did so with a slow, undulating pulse along the floor. I could see its outside was covered in what might have been feelers or fleshy tubes, and as it gradually made its way towards me I could see them flicking out and spasming wildly, in what looked horribly like excitement.

Instinct, honed throughout my entire childhood, kicked in and I pulled the thick blanket I was under up and over my head. I gripped the edges close to my chest, weeping and muttering desperate prayers. I clung to it, my tiny island of safety and protection, not even daring to stick my arm out to grab my phone from the nightstand. Who would I have called, anyway? Who could possibly have been prepared to deal with something like this?

As my mind raced through the possibilities, I gradually began to realise that I could hear nothing from beyond the blanket, nor did it appear I had been devoured by whatever the thing in the darkness was. Very gently I poked my head out from my sanctuary. It was still there, looming in the doorway, utterly still. As soon as I saw it, though, it convulsed back into movement and started once again making its way towards me, painstaking and slow. I dived back under the covers, gripping them tighter than ever.

Another hour passed, and then two, but it was only when I poked my head out that the thing would move. As ridiculous as it sounds, it seemed that while I was under the covers it couldn’t move. It couldn’t get me.

I stayed under the rest of the night. When the daylight began streaming in the next morning, I finally left the safety of my bed to see what had become of the thing. It was gone, unsurprisingly, and in its place there was simply a small patch of dark, foul-smelling water.

I wasn’t quite ready to celebrate, though, and the following night proved me right. Because it came back. I woke again, and saw it start that twitching, torturous journey towards me. So back under the covers I went, heart racing, desperately trying to think through what might be happening to me. In retrospect it’s odd that at no point did I even consider that I might be hallucinating. I never had any doubts that the thing was real. At some point I finally fell asleep, and I guess I managed to stay under that blanket.

That’s been my life for the last week and a half. I wake up, gripped by terror of the dark, and hide under the covers from this thing that only comes closer when I leave their protection. It’s been awful, obviously, but in the end it wasn’t the gradual wearing down of my nerves that got me. If anything, it was the opposite. I got too comfortable.

Last night I woke up like before. I sensed it there, but as I raised the covers over my head, I realised that I wasn’t worried. Fear had given way to routine. I lay there, warm and protected, and simply waited to fall back to sleep. But this time, what I felt instead was a sudden weight pressing down on the end of my bed. Whipping tendrils began to smack and grasp against my flimsy fabric barrier. I could see that shape of absolute darkness looming over me, quivering with triumph. Then I heard a voice, crisp and clear, whispering.

And it said, “The blanket never did anything.”

I won’t describe what happened after that. You’ve taken plenty of photos of my back and shoulders already. To say it hurts is the least of its horrors. That thing will come for me again tonight, I know it will, and there is nothing that can protect me. I just thought sharing my story might help some other poor idiot in the future.

I miss my blanket. Hiding was always so much easier.

Marker.

Uh, statement ends.

Well, er, that was… I suppose this is what I do now. Um… there, there aren’t any photos in the file, er, certainly not of weird supernatural injuries. There’s a photocopy of a death certificate for Benjamin Hatendi – looks like Martin has highlighted the cause of death. Says “Unknown – possible biological agent. All samples incinerated”. It’s dated as March 7th 1983, five days after this statement.

Then there are some old cuttings about Robin Patton. Profiles from magazines… um… [papers rustling] Oh, he must have been quite something in the hiking community. Ah, apparently he wrote a book. Something about the best natural pools and lakes for swimming. Yeah, mostly just background fluff, and pictures of the guy emerging topless from waterfalls. Hmm, wasn’t bad-looking, before… well… that.

Er, anyway, er, doesn’t look relevant.

I, I suppose that’s it. Er, the only other thing in there is… a sealed Ziploc bag containing an old fabric tag. Fantastic. Looks like it might be from a mattress or a duvet, maybe. It’s, uh, it’s got some rather pronounced dark stains on the end. It’s probably nonsense. It’s all probably nonsense. But I’m going to keep it sealed.

Uh… I suppose… that’s a wrap.

Thank you for meeting me.

MELANIE
Well, why wouldn’t I? It’s not like you’re ‘wanted for murder’.

ARCHIVIST
[SHUSHING NOISES]
Can you keep it down?

MELANIE
[Stage whisper] Sure, I’ll just quietly sit here and become an accessory, shall I?

ARCHIVIST
You, you –

You know I didn’t do it.

MELANIE
Oh. Oh, do I? Is that what I know?

ARCHIVIST
Alright. Why didn’t you send the police, then?

…

If you genuinely think I’m a killer, why meet me?

MELANIE
W– I mean, it’s not… it’s not like you’ve got any reason to kill me.

ARCHIVIST
[NON-COMMITTAL SOUND]
MELANIE
Fine. I don’t think you did it. But I still don’t want to get caught up in whatever it is.

ARCHIVIST
Should have thought about that before you joined the Institute.

MELANIE
What is the deal with you people? Look, I know it’s kind of a boys’ club, but you all really hate me being there, don’t you?

ARCHIVIST
What? No, I –

There’s a lot of very messed up things going on there and, I… I mean, we were already tied to them, but you I just… You didn’t need to get involved.

MELANIE
I really don’t think that’s true.

…

ARCHIVIST
How’s the leg?

MELANIE
Fine. Got shot by a ghost.

ARCHIVIST
Uh… er, what?

MELANIE
Look, can we not do that now? I’m really not in the mood. What do you want?

ARCHIVIST
I… Right. It’s… like I said, there’s a lot of messed up stuff at the Institute, and… I think the murders might be the least of it. I need someone on the inside to keep an eye on things, let me know what’s going on. I’d ask someone else, but…

MELANIE
Tim hates you, and Martin’s probably being watched.

ARCHIVIST
And Elias is my chief suspect, so… I’m also rather missing the library. My investigative tools out here are, uh, lacking.

MELANIE
You know what? Fine. Fine! But you tell me everything. Okay? Everything.

ARCHIVIST
I mean… you, you won’t believe it.

MELANIE
I don’t care.

ARCHIVIST
Alright. Alright.

MELANIE
Start with Sasha.

Okay.

Look, I’m really not sure about this.

ARCHIVIST
I just need to borrow it for a half hour or so. I, I’ll look after it.

GEORGIE
Wha – No, I don’t –

You can blow it up for all I care. It’s been in the loft for, like, twenty years. If I need tape hiss, I’ll add it in post.

ARCHIVIST
So, what’s the problem?

GEORGIE
With playing an unmarked tape from your stalker?

ARCHIVIST
Uh…

Look, you just have to trust me, okay.

GEORGIE
Yeah, and I want to do that, but how can I when you still won’t tell me what’s going on?

ARCHIVIST
You wouldn’t believe me!

GEORGIE
Try me.

ARCHIVIST
…

[Sigh] You’re right.

It’s… It’s alright. I can just go.

GEORGIE
Come on, I’m not throwing you out, John. I know you wouldn’t be here if you had anywhere else to go, and I… I do want to help, but… y’know, you’re a good person. You were, at least. But whatever this is, it’s messing you up!

[Sigh] Look I’ve, I’ve got work to do. You listen, or don’t listen, or cross-record, or whatever you want, just… just think about it first, okay? You can choose to leave it alone.

GERTRUDE
Case 0141010, Sebastian Skinner. Incident occurred in Gwydir Forest, North Wales, September 2014. Statement given 10th of October, 2014. Committed to tape 4th of April, 2015. Gertrude Robinson recording.

GERTRUDE (STATEMENT)
Everyone always tells me I don’t notice things. “Sebastian,” they say, “you wouldn’t notice if you grew a second nose.” And I suppose in many ways that’s true. It’s not that I’m forgetful or stupid, you understand, just that I’m not very good at spotting things that are out of place. The mind has a way of filling in things it’s not concentrating on; just wallpapering them over with what you expect to see. I rather think that part of my brain is more powerful than in most people. I’ll never notice if you got a new haircut or piercing, and it’s a bit of a gamble whether I notice when you’ve had a baby.

You’d think that’d get in the way of being a plumber, but it really hasn’t, to be honest. The thing you’ve got to remember is, if I know what I need to focus on I spot things just fine. And plumbing’s great for that – depending on the problem, there’s always the things I know need checking, one after the other, until one of them doesn’t look right. Then the fix is usually simple enough. There’s no need to look at the thing as a whole, or pinpoint changes or oddities.

So, even now, thinking back, it’s hard to say if there was anything particularly strange about the call as it came in. Saying that I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary doesn’t really mean anything in that context. I suppose that the location they gave me was a bit of a surprise. I run my business out of Penmachno, out in Gwydir Forest, and it’s not exactly a densely populated area. I service people all over the region, and I wasn’t aware of any village or buildings out in the area of the woods the caller directed me to. I mean, they had co-ordinates on GPS, as there were no street names that they could give for reference. It was an area I did sometimes drive though, and I didn’t remember anything being there, but I also didn’t really think about it at the time. I suppose I reasoned that maybe there were some houses out there and, well, I hadn’t noticed.

The problem sounded like a simple enough blockage, so I packed up my van, and started the journey over. It shouldn’t have taken nearly as long as it did, but the roads aren’t all that easy to navigate at night, even with your satnav doing its best, and especially when heading towards somewhere you’re not familiar with, trying to find the right road to get into some hidden valley or other. The call must have come in about seven thirty, as I’d just finished my dinner. I don’t normally do night callouts, but something about it had seemed urgent, and they had agreed to double my standard rate.

I pulled up to a small collection of ramshackle looking buildings, made of wood and corrugated sheet metal, all set up around a large central building, that seemed like some sort of workshop or small factory. At first I thought it might have been a logging facility, but we were only a few miles from Penmachno, so if there were trees being chopped down here, I’d have known about it. Probably. I mean, even I’d be hard-pressed to miss the sound of industrial chainsaws.

I pulled off the side of what seemed like a makeshift car park and got out. Somebody came over to meet me. Megan, she said her name was, and that we’d spoken on the phone. She was very still when she said this, and seemed to be waiting for me to respond, so I grabbed my tools, and told her to show me to the plughole. She seemed a bit taken aback by this, so I apologised, assuming I’d been a bit too crude for her, and I asked her where I could find the problem drain.

She led me up to the big building, gripped the door, and flung it open wide. There was a damp, metallic smell that came from inside. Probably from the backed up drain, I thought, although I will admit it didn’t smell much like anything I’d encountered before. Megan was stood in the doorway, arms spread wide for some reason, but to be honest I’d been checking my tools, and hadn’t really seen what she was doing. I asked her again to take me to the drain, and she made a rather odd noise, and led me inside.

We walked through the main floor of the workshop, with people bustling about either side, doing whatever it was they were doing. My mind was focused on the job at hand. Megan took me into a back room full of pipes and gratings, and pointed to a drain in the centre of the floor where dark water was pooling out of the top. You’d have thought the dark red would have clued me in to what was happening but, honestly, there are all sorts of industrial chemicals that turn water that colour, so it didn’t really register as worrying. So, I pulled up the grate, and got to work.

All through it, Megan was chatting with me quietly. She was whispering, making it a bit hard to hear her over the noise from the main building, so I mostly just nodded and made the appropriate sounds of interest. And I thought she was talking about her hobbies. After all, I’d never actually heard the term ‘flensing’ before, and the way she was talking about it I assumed it was some sort of a sculpture. I mean, you meet all sorts of strange people in my line of work, and I pride myself on being able to keep up a gentle conversation with all of them. I have, of course, since looked up flensing, and that certainly throws a lot of that conversation into a very different light indeed. I don’t think she was offering to do a sculpture of me.

Anyway, soon enough I’d found the blockage: a big old wad of hardened fat and oil that had congealed at one of the bends, and removed it for them. It wasn’t nearly as big a job as I’d been afraid it might have been, and I talked Megan through my invoicing procedure as we walked back through the workshop floor.

She was silent as I left, and seemed as though she was trying to get over some sort of shock. I guessed that she’d come over a bit queasy when I’d pulled out the blockage, and was embarrassed to admit it. It’s a common enough thing: the sight of the sort of mess that builds up in drainpipes can really get to you if you’re not used to it. Anyway, I decided not to mention anything, just handed her my details, and told her I’d be in touch about payment. Then I hopped back into my van and drove away. Job done.

At least, I had assumed it was job done. I wish, I very much wish, that it had been job done. It was the next day that the phone rang, about midday, and the now-familiar voice of Megan asked me to come back. She said that they were having the same problem, but with a different drain. This struck me as a little bit odd, since I’d been pretty sure a building like that would only have one central drain, which I had already sorted out.

Still, there was no harm in going to have a look, I told myself. After all, they clearly didn’t know anything about plumbing over there, and if I took good care of them I might have gotten myself a nice supply of repeat business. So once again I packed up my truck, and started the drive.

It was the most infuriating thing. Even in the daylight, having been there once already, finding the little valley proved remarkably difficult. I’d set out in good time, but it was still getting well into the afternoon when I finally pulled up into the small, dirt clearing.

I hopped out to a sight that, in the daylight, even I noticed was deeply odd: Megan was stood there, waving a greeting at me, dressed in some sort of bright, blue and red costume, like a jester or a clown. Had she been wearing that the night before? Surely not. Although, I suppose I didn’t really look at her clothes. Sat on a folding chair next to her was a squat, thickly muscled woman with close-cropped black hair, who stared at me with a really vicious-looking smirk. She exchanged a glance with Megan, who just nodded at her, and then she burst into cruel laughter, and I was suddenly feeling very uncomfortable.

I just stood there, toolbox in hand, debating whether or not to turn around and drive away. I had just about decided to leave when I felt Megan’s hand grip my wrist. I hadn’t noticed her moving towards me. Her fingers dug into me, and they felt really, really wrong. Like hard plastic wrapped in raw bacon. She was strong though, strong enough to drag me toward the big workshop and its open door. I was struggling, and told her to let me go, but she just ignored me. I cried out to the woman sat on the lawn chair for help, but she just laughed harder.

I was still begging for help when I felt Megan’s hard, cold fingers dig into the top of my head and turn it to face into the building. I hadn’t noticed that we’d reached the door, but in the afternoon sunlight, the reality of what I had walked through the night before was clearly shown in terrible detail.

Rows and rows of old and broken stools stood before crude frames of wire and wood. Sat on each stool were figures of all shapes and sizes. None of them were human. Some were wood themselves, old, and stained with rot. Some were a shiny, dark plastic or porcelain white. A few were cloth and hessian, stuffed to bursting and leaking sawdust from a dozen places. All of them were featureless, and moved with a jerky motion like nothing I had seen outside of my dreams.

Each gripped a razor-sharp knife, and moved it swiftly over the human heads suspended in the frames from wire and fishhooks, gently cutting around the edges. I could see the rest of the bodies piled haphazardly in the corner, and for a second all I was able to do was wonder why they didn’t smell worse than they did.

Then all the cutting figures turned to face me at once, and I screamed. And when I screamed, the eyes of every head swivelled in their frames and stared at me with the desperate pleading that told me they still knew pain. I was babbling, pleading with Megan, asking what she wanted. “I want you to meet our boss,” she said lightly. I didn’t know who that was, and she stared at me, skin starting to slip away from her painted-on eyes. “You may call them I Do Not Know You.”

I don’t know why those words filled me with such deep dread, but I felt every muscle in my body tighten. On instinct, and without warning, I swung the toolbox up with all the force I had in me into Megan’s face, and heard the crunching crack of something brittle shatter. Her hand released my arm as I stared at her, face now twisted and hanging off the dark plastic of her head, the empty mouth moving, trying to match the vile sounds coming from the rest of her.

I ran, sprinting back to my van as fast as I could, only to see that the woman with the cropped hair had stood up and moved to the driver’s side door. I didn’t have time to slow down; I just prepared to try and tackle her, when she did something I didn’t expect. She opened the door for me, and stepped back.

Not taking time to consider this, I leapt into the seat, and started to fumble for the keys. The engine roared to life immediately, and I was just about to get out of there when I realised I could feel the woman’s hand on my shoulder. I looked at her, the door still open, and she winked at me. Without warning, a terrible, blistering heat erupted on my back, and I screamed again, this time in agony. Reflex slammed my foot down, and I felt the car start as she removed her hand, laughing that same horrible laugh.

I did manage to get away, though there’s a good chance I’ll never use this arm properly again. I went to the police, of course. I didn’t tell them exactly what happened, just that I’d noticed what I believed to be human remains during a job, and had been attacked as I tried to leave. They actually took me seriously, and were all prepared to drive out to investigate, as I understand it, when the fire started. The worst fire in Gwydir Forest for almost two hundred years, apparently. Some of the most beautiful natural scenery in the world reduced to ash. It destroyed my home, as well as quite a few of the others in Penmachno, but luckily nobody died.

The weirdest part, though? Nobody died, officially speaking, because although the police, fire crews and forest services combed the burned area acre by scorched acre, they didn’t find any human remains at all. The closest they found was the warped and twisted frame of an old, plastic mannequin.

GERTRUDE
Final comments: When this statement was added to the Collection, I was convinced it was the Stranger issuing me a direct threat. Mr. Sebastian Skinner. It seemed too targeted a name to be real. But all my research points to him being a real person: a plumber trading out of Penmachno for almost twenty years. Hopefully not too ominous a coincidence.

The concerning part of this statement, at least as far as I’m concerned, is not so much what is happening, as the fact that it is happening so soon. I had assumed Orsinov and her ilk would have spent more time searching for their precious skin, maybe even acting against me directly, before they started alternate preparations. I had hoped I’d have a chance to recover. I can still barely stand.

I’d hoped there would be more time.

As with anything like this, exact calculations are impossible, but based on Mr. Skinner’s testimony, I think there’s every likelihood that they will be ready to perform the Unknowing within the next few years. There may be no chance for a more… ‘nuanced’ way to disrupt it, so I’ll likely have to resort to a somewhat more… direct countermeasure. Hmm.

It interests me that Jude Perry would be involved. I was unaware that The Lightless Flame had had any contact with the Stranger’s ilk, but I suppose it makes sense that it would be a possible ally to the Devastation, especially since their own plans have so recently, erm, gone up in flames. Perhaps they hope to achieve a pride of place in the world Orsinov hopes to bring about? Or maybe, they simply relished the chance to burn down some beautiful forest.

Regardless, I’ve been keeping an eye Jude’s movements ever since she lost Agnes, and it appears she’s back in Havering. Part of me wants to confront her, see what she knows, but I’m not that desperate. Not yet. [Sigh]

I’ve been unable to contact Mr. Skinner since he gave his statement. Sad, but unsurprising. There’s no doubt in my mind that when the Unknowing begins, one of the dancers will be wearing his face.

Hmm. What strikes me more than anything else here is the date. It’s only a year or so before she died. I had assumed Gertrude had recorded to tape for a while and then stopped, but it seems she was recording them right up until the end. But if they did span decades of working at the Institute, why aren’t there more? And what decided which statements she transferred?

Regardless, whoever my mystery pen pal is, it seems they’re pushing me in a very deliberate direction. It sounds like the Unknowing is a ritual, one connected to the Stranger, this ‘I Do Not Know You’. What did Gertrude mean about skin? The page she was given by Mary, maybe? No, that doesn’t add up. [Sigh] God, this is confusing.

For the first time, though, I feel like I might have a lead. It’s tangential, not directly connected to the Stranger or the Unknowing, but… but I have a name now. Jude Perry, and she was still living in London less than two years ago. It’s not much, but it is a start. I don’t know if I have the resources to track her down myself, but if Melanie’s willing to help, the Institute might have more luck.

[FAINT SOUNDS OF CALLIOPE MUSIC COME DRIFTING IN]

If she is an active member of the Lightless Flame cult there’s every possibility tracking her down will be dangerous, but it’s also the… the only…?

Yeah. Yeah, thought I was going mad. Christ, are you alright?

[THE MUSIC FADES AWAY]
ARCHIVIST
Ummm…

GEORGIE
Was it the tape?

ARCHIVIST
What? No! No, it w– it w– it was – it was outside.

GEORGIE
No, not, not the music, your face!

ARCHIVIST
What?

GEORGIE
That’s it. Whatever the hell this deal is, the tapes, documents, I don’t want them in my house.

ARCHIVIST
Look, look… No, no…

Look, you, you don’t need to be scared.

GEORGIE
I’m not! You are! Look at you, you can barely stand!

ARCHIVIST
But I… But I need –

GEORGIE
Listen to me, John. I can’t stop you doing… whatever secret bullshit you want to do, and I’m… not going to throw you out on the street, but I’m not having it in my home.

ARCHIVIST
No… No, they won’t. I’ll make sure it doesn’t… I’ll keep it far away.

GEORGIE
No, you need to stop.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not sure I can.

BASIRA
Huh.

You still recording then?

MARTIN
What?

[CHAIRS MOVING, PAPERS RUSTLING]
BASIRA
Why? I thought that was John’s thing.

MARTIN
I mean, yeah, a bit.

You wanted to see me?

BASIRA
Yeah, well, your boss is busy and I tried talking to Tim, but…

MARTIN
Yeah, right.

BASIRA
And he said Sasha’s gone, so I thought I’d talk to you.

MARTIN
Okay. What do you want?

BASIRA
I’m looking for Daisy.

MARTIN
Oh for – Okay, I don’t know where she is! I don’t know where anybody is! Why does everyone… okay, why does everyone think that I always know where everyone is, all the time?!

BASIRA
Alright, okay, alright, sorry. They just… well, they said at the station that this was the last place she checked in.

MARTIN
When she was interviewing us. That was like a month ago!

BASIRA
Yeah, I haven’t heard anything so I went to check in with her at the station, and they said she hadn’t been in since February.

MARTIN
And no-one’s looked into that?

BASIRA
I mean, they don’t keep a close eye on… Well, she goes off the grid sometimes when working a case. Never this long, though. I thought it might have something to do with… y’know.

MARTIN
Look, he didn’t kill anyone, okay? There’s… I think something’s going on, okay. I actually think he was framed.

BASIRA
Yeah, well, I hope so. If not, well… I just can’t believe I was so stupid, you know? He really got me.

MARTIN
Got you how?

BASIRA
I actually thought I misjudged him. Hell, I liked the guy.

MARTIN
Wait, you mean… like you…

BASIRA
[Spluttering] Oh, what? Urgh, no! Why does everyone think that?

MARTIN
Right, yeah, ‘cause I don’t actually… I don’t actually think he…

BASIRA
I just, I mean he was good company. Y’know, when he wasn’t being a paranoia machine. He was funny, you know?

MARTIN
What, John?

BASIRA
Yeah.

MARTIN
I don’t think I’ve ever heard him tell a joke.

BASIRA
Maybe you weren’t listening.

MARTIN
Right. Well, I’m sure it’ll get sorted out when Daisy brings him in and you can probably talk to him then. Oh, sorry, I forgot you’re not actually with the police any more, are you.

BASIRA
Thanks.

So, you have no idea where Daisy is?

MARTIN
I’m sure she’s fine. She’s probably just using her “operation discretion” to bully someone else.

BASIRA
What did you say?

MARTIN
Well, she was really rude, actually. She threatened to say I –

BASIRA
No, no. Did she use the phrase “operational discretion”?

MARTIN
Yeah. She said she had “full operational discretion”.

Is everything alright?

BASIRA
I need to find him.

MARTIN
Well, I’m sure your partner will find him; I just hope she’s not as –

BASIRA
No, I need to find him now! You’re sure you don’t know where she is?

MARTIN
No! I don’t know anything.

BASIRA
Okay, alright, fine. Just… Here’s my number. You call me immediately if you find anything out, okay?

MARTIN
Fine. Now please, we’re really busy.

BASIRA
Yeah, I need to go.

MARTIN
Yeah, good luck.

[PAPERS SHUFFLING]
Martin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording statement number 0031104, statement of Enrique MacMillan, given 4th November 2003.

Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
I never really loved the digging. Too much like hard work, I always used to say, and I’m not a young man anymore. So generally, if the finds aren’t near enough the surface for me to just pick them up, I’ll leave them be. Sometimes, though, you just can’t help yourself. You need to know what’s under there, so you get down on your knees and dig, dig, dig.

Last Saturday was like that. I hadn’t thought it would be, really. My knees had been acting up all week because of the damp, and I was mainly going out for the walk, rather than looking for any particular finds. To be honest, I was in two minds about taking the metal detector at all; it’s not exactly a lightweight piece of equipment. Back when I lived in London I always used to do mudlarking down the Thames. Wandering through the low tide with nothing but a bag, my eyes and a pair of thick gloves. I miss those days, without the weight of the detector. Without the need to dig.

I don’t even know why I took it. In the end, that stretch of beach is hardly virgin territory for hobbyists like me, and it’s usually been picked perfectly clean. So you can imagine my surprise when I started to pick something up just before Smeatons Pier.

It was almost dark by this point, and the cool salt air of St Ives harbour blew a fine spray of sand against my cheeks. It stung slightly, but not in an unpleasant way. Bracing, I think the word is. It was peaceful, quiet, and I was lost in my own thoughts, staring out over the darkening ocean, when the metal detector interrupted, breaking my trance.

I pulled out my little torch and shone it at the spot, looking for the telltale glint. But there was nothing but sand. Whatever it was must have been buried. I was debating with myself whether to leave it be when the detector barked again, more insistently. I hadn’t found anything else that day, so I sighed, pulled out my small, metal spade out of my bag, and started to dig.

It was only a minute or two before I saw it, a hint of gold-plated metal amid the coarser gold of the sand. A watch. The face was cracked down the middle, and the hands were frozen at four nineteen, but other than that it seemed to be in rather good condition. Not a bad little find, I remember thinking, as I started to clean the sand from around it. And uncovered the wrist it was still attached to.

I think I screamed. I must have cried out in some way, but nobody heard me, as there was no-one to hear but me. I cleared away a bit more sand, just to be sure of what I was seeing, and quickly revealed a stiff, unmoving hand. The flesh was icy cold and discoloured, so I was certain its owner must be dead, but it didn’t appear to have begun decomposing. I lowered myself slowly to the ground, trying to collect my thoughts, considering the thing I had just discovered with my clumsy, reckless digging.

I wanted to call the police immediately, but I don’t have a mobile phone, and it was a little bit of a walk to the nearest phonebox. My legs wouldn’t stop shaking when I tried to stand up, so I sat there for a while, my torch shining on that lifeless hand, trying to compose myself enough to go get help. It was an odd thing, that hand. The fingers were bent and bloody, and the nails had been chipped and broken. From the looks of it, the damage had happened before its owner had passed away.

Then I noticed something else in the sand next to it. Something protruding ever so slightly from the sand I’d already disturbed. It didn’t seem like part of the body, and I found myself reaching over to try and pull it up. It slipped out of the sand easily, eagerly even, and I didn’t even need to dig.

It was a book. The cloth of the cover had worn away, and it was still wet from the seawater that covered the area at high tide. I expected it to be a useless lump of wet paper mush, fused together and unreadable, but when I pulled it open the pages came apart easily. There was a label at the very front, but the ink had run and I have no idea what it might have said. So I turned to the first page.

It was very strange. It was just the one word, solid capital letters in a small, neat typeface at the very centre of the page. It said ‘DIG’. I took that to be the title, and turned to the next page. ‘DIG’. Exactly the same. The third page. ‘DIG’. The fourth page. ‘DIG’. Dig, dig, dig, dig.

Holding it hurt my hands. You know the way that if you say or read a word over and over again, it starts to lose all its meaning? To just sound like a jumble of noises or unrelated letters? Well this was the opposite. Every time I read it, it was like the meaning of the word became more solid in my mind. I knew what it was to find your meaning buried in the earth, to claw your sense from under the sand and mud and soil, to dig.

I had almost completely unearthed the body when the police arrived. Apparently a late-night jogger had spotted the scene, and called them. They believed me when I explained to them how I had found it, though they were none too pleased that I had so thoroughly ruined what may well have been a crime scene. I don’t think it was, and one of the friendlier officers later told me the man had probably dug himself too deep a hole in the beach, and it had collapsed on him when the tide had come in. A tragedy, but not unheard of. They still weren’t pleased with me, though, and once they had my statement I was sent on my way. The book was in my bag, and they didn’t ask to look inside, so… I kept it. I probably should have mentioned it to the police, but they were very rude. I understand now, of course, that they were simply irritated that I had robbed them of their opportunity to dig.

Perhaps they sensed it, that need inside of us. Above us, you see, there’s only the sky, the infinite, a void of space and emptiness so incredible that to think of it in detail is to overwhelm the mind. But down, down into the earth. Through the many layers of this globe, this sphere built and crusted upon a single, beating point. The centre of the universe for each and every one of us, that glorious convergence from which everything, everywhere, is ‘up’. To reach it, to approach that source, that rolling, molten centre of it all, the only thing you have to do is dig.

I’ve dreamed of it, of course. Safe and happy below, wrapped on all sides by uncounted miles of crushing, loving, earth and stone. I see it, and watch the passing of history build upon it, layer after layer. To travel down into the ground is to travel through time, that’s what I always used to say, before I found my book. And I still believe it, but time is the least of the things that waits for us down there, things I can barely think of without collapsing in fear. A thousand terrible things, trapped and alone, out of air and out of light, all contained within those three hideous letters: DIG.

In those dreams I hold a spade. It screams when I plunge it into the weeping soil, and the voice it cries out with is my own. The soft mud begs me to stop, trying in vain to save me. But I do not listen, and the pitted ruin of my shovel moves lump after lump of it, tearing it free of itself, and piling it around me, sculpting my own grave. Bringing the ground up to meet me where I must be buried. It fills my lungs, and I am free. I am awake. The shovel is in my hand, and the book is open to its chapter and verse: DIG.

In the moments without the shovel, without the torn ground, I have tried to find out more about the book, maybe even get rid of it. A bookseller I asked about it pointed me towards you and yours, before I dug into him, and so here I came. To tell my story, of course, but another thing as well; cold, empty and calling. There’s something here, you see. Something to be dug up, rooted out, buried within. A hollow space that all eyes point towards. And I intend to reach it, if my fingers don’t give out first. I know where to dig.

MARTIN
[Recomposing himself] Uh, um, the, uh, the statement ends rather abruptly there. Based on a few scattered notes and accounts from some of the older staff, it sounds like Mr. Macmillan got in a bit of a fight, which led to his arrest, and the replacement of quite a bit of the floor in John’s office. There are still a couple of boards with marks on them that I’d always hoped weren’t fingernail scratches, but I guess…

…

Anyway, Mr. Macmillan passed away while awaiting trial. Official cause of death is listed as “asphyxiation”, but I can’t find any details about exactly what happened. The book is currently held by Artefact Storage in a welded iron box, and placed on the top of the Do Not Access list, but since then it doesn’t look like it’s caused anything weird to happen.

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Er, yes?

[DOOR OPENS]
MELANIE
Hi, have you got a moment?

MARTIN
Um, yeah, I think, um…

MELANIE
Are you alright?

MARTIN
Yeah… Sorry, just a lot of change recently, y’know. You and John and Sasha and… everything’s gone a bit wrong.

It’s the not knowing, you know? I mean, John’s still alive. Not sure why, but I’m sure of that. But Sasha, I…

MELANIE
Yes, it’s… it’s probably, um…

MARTIN
Sorry, sorry, I’m – What do you need?

MELANIE
Oh, right, yes. Is there any sort of database, maybe?

[MARTIN SNORTS]
MELANIE
Statement givers or people referenced? I’m trying to get hold of a witness from a recent one.

MARTIN
Yeah, yeah, I wish. That would… I mean, that would make the job a lot easier.

MELANIE
No-one’s even tried to make one?

MARTIN
Oh, you weren’t here when we took the place over from Gertrude. It’s been over a year just to get it like this. I mean, I think the database was on John’s list, but…

MELANIE
So how do you track someone down?

MARTIN
Oh, oh well, y’know, we’ve a few contacts in various record offices around the place. Aside from that it’s just… just a bit of detective work, really. Er, Tim used to do a great line in impersonating people to utility companies. Ah, the number of times he got them to give him ‘his own’ address…

MELANIE
Right, right… Um, this one, the name is “Jude Perry”. Doesn’t mean anything to you, does it?

MARTIN
Uh… no. Did she give a statement?

MELANIE
Not yet.

MARTIN
Well. Sorry I can’t be more help.

MELANIE
Sure. Oh, er, one other thing. Who do I talk to about Artefact Storage?

MARTIN
Oh, er, depends what you need, probably Sonja. Why? Are you sure you’re ready for it?

MELANIE
What’s that supposed to mean?

MARTIN
No, no, I just, just… Y’know, it’s… There’s a lot of weird stuff in there.

MELANIE
[Indignant] I’m not an amateur, Martin. I know the sort of thing that’s in there. I just need to know who I talk to about missing pieces.

MARTIN
Yeah, prob-probably Sonja.

Wait, why? What’s gone missing?

MELANIE
An old calliope [pronounces it ‘Ka-lee-o-pee’] organ. It’s there in the inventory, but no-one can find it when I ask.

MARTIN
Huh. I mean, that’s not… great. Er, did you need it for something?

MELANIE
Just following up a statement. Trying to get a few answers, you know?

MARTIN
Huh. Well, if you find any, let me know.

ARCHIVIST
Something funny, Ms. Perry?

JUDE
[Chuckling] Uh, yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Care to share?

JUDE
I think it’s pretty obvious.

ARCHIVIST
Look, I lost my normal coat, and i-it’s cold. Some of us actually feel it, you know?

JUDE
You wouldn’t shake my hand.

ARCHIVIST
Well, no, I’m not stupid! Whatever the Lightless Flame is –

L-Look, will you stop that?!

JUDE
[Laughing] Oh, alright. Ah… I hate explaining jokes, but, um… Imagine you’re, um… a butcher, and one day an injured little lamb walks into your workshop, and strides right into one of the mincing machines, but when you go up to it, knife in hand, it shakes it’s head and tells you “I’m not stupid”. Do you get why that’s funny?

ARCHIVIST
Right. But no more abattoir metaphors, please.

JUDE
Suppose it’s not really me, is it? Would you rather be a really stupid piece of firewood?

ARCHIVIST
I just have a few questions. Did you burn down a section of Gwydir Forest last year?

JUDE
Not alone, but yes. You should have seen how devastated they were, such a loss.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sure the Forestry Commission were mortified. Why?

JUDE
…

Stop that! And it was because Nikola Orsinov asked us to. She was done with the place, and we’re always happy to help, when that help is destroying something someone loves.

ARCHIVIST
But –

JUDE
No more questions, Archivist!

ARCHIVIST
I just… er, you were a friend of Agnes Montague, correct?

JUDE
She’s not one of your little stories.

ARCHIVIST
According to the statement of Jack Barnabas, she very much is.

JUDE
The burnt-face little runt? He got what was coming to him. Just like…

ARCHIVIST
Yes, yes, I understand, you could easily kill me, I’m at your mercy, blah, blah, blah. I have heard it before. And from things much scarier than you.

JUDE
That a fact?

ARCHIVIST
Okay, so… why haven’t you done it?

JUDE
We’re in public.

ARCHIVIST
Well, you’re not – You’re hardly keeping your voice down.

JUDE
You talk about god and death and demons nice and loud, and watch people bend over backwards not to listen to what you’re saying. No-one cares.

ARCHIVIST
If you say so.

JUDE
Are you trying to talk me into killing you? If I wanted, I could reach through your chest like runny wax, and hold your heart while it cooked. No-one would even notice, if I didn’t give you time to scream.

ARCHIVIST
Right. R-right. So why don’t you? Does your ‘god’ not want you to?

JUDE
[Considering] Hard to say. When I look at you I feel that burning liquid pain, eager to flow out and purify your rotten carcass, but I feel that a lot.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. M-More or less than normal?

JUDE
Hard to say when every nerve ending’s on fire. Hard to tell degrees.

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] Third degree, maybe?

Oh! Sorry, sorry, it was a…

I have a god too, right?

JUDE
Is that another joke?

ARCHIVIST
N-No, I… I’m new to this. Everyone keeps calling me ‘Archivist”, like I’m special, and that… that I serve the Eye. Trying to kill me for it.

JUDE
Yes.

ARCHIVIST
S-So… I-It’s like… your ‘god’, right?

JUDE
Oh please, your god is nothing! The Eye, Beholding, Ceaseless Watcher, whatever you call it, that’s all it does, it watches and knows, sitting bulbous and comfortable in the ignorance of infinite knowledge.

I serve a reckoning, a surging tide of destruction and pain.

ARCHIVIST
The Lightless Flame.

JUDE
The Desolation. Blackened Earth. The destructive, agonising heat of burning flesh and land scoured of life. The light, the comfort of fire stripped from it, leaving nothing but the terror of its approach. When it triumphs, it will leave The Eye a burned and shrivelled husk that sees nothing but its own agony.

ARCHIVIST
I, er, I think I… I-I see. So if one… if one wants to watch everything, to know everything and the other wants to… destroy –

JUDE
[Exhales laughingly] You don’t even know what this is about, do you?

ARCHIVIST
So tell me!

JUDE
An Archivist pleading for knowledge. That, oh, that is satisfying to see.

ARCHIVIST
Look, if you’re just… You’re just about my only lead, and if you’re… Just kill me, alright? If it’s so easy? If you’re not going to tell me anything worth my time.

JUDE
Now you’re sounding like an Archivist.

ARCHIVIST
Hm.

JUDE
And now I’m obviously not going to kill you.

ARCHIVIST
Why not?

JUDE
Consider it a favour.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

JUDE
Not for you. For Elias.

ARCHIVIST
Wait, but… [Splutters] I mean, if I serve Beholding or… He-He’s in a lot deeper than I am. I think.

JUDE
The rumour is he killed Gertrude Robinson. If so, I feel like I owe him. And he clearly wants you alive, so…

ARCHIVIST
What, no? But she was the last Archivist, so, y-your… your god… Why?

JUDE
The unfathomable contest of eternal forces is not the only reason I might want someone dead.

ARCHIVIST
So… so tell me the story of why you wanted Gertrude – AH – AAH!

[SOUND OF SIZZLING]
JUDE
Try to compel me again, and I’ll burn it out your mouth.

…

[BIRDS CHIRP HAPPILY]
Now you’re scared. Now you’re getting it. There’s no safety in sitting on the sidelines watching. The audience is only safe when the story isn’t about them.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. Fine! Keep your damn secrets.

JUDE
…

No. Maybe I do want to tell you a story.

ARCHIVIST
Well, if it’s not about Gertrude or Gwydir…. And I can’t talk about A– right… Then what?

JUDE
I’m going to give you some advice.

ARCHIVIST
Fantastic.

Well?

JUDE
Aren’t you going to say your words?

ARCHIVIST
[Sigh] Statement of Jude Perry, regarding… some advice. Recorded direct from subject, April 24th, 2017. Statement begins.

JUDE (STATEMENT)
Well, if you smother a flame, it dies. The only way it grows and flourishes is if you feed it. It’s about making sure you find enough fuel for it, and… not caring where it comes from. If you spend your time hiding and fretting about who you hurt, you’ll sputter, and you’ll die as surely as any candle. Don’t be afraid to burn.

The pain is sensational. You feel your flesh cooking, your nerves screaming out as they die exquisitely. Your whole body changes texture as you become that which feeds the fire. In that agonising, beautiful transformation, you can feel it ignite again and again and again.

At least, that’s how it feels for me. I don’t know how it would feel for you. Maybe you get an itchy eye? I don’t care. The point is, whatever form it takes, you have to feed it for it to grow strong. Otherwise you’re the one that gets consumed.

I never hid my flame. Not once. Even before I found my god, I burned as bright as I liked, and those who ventured too close simply ended up fuelling my brilliance. At the time, the closest thing I had to god was cocaine, though I also spent my evenings as an acolyte to alcohol.

But my true thrill was money. Not mine, of course, though I had plenty, but the money of others I could fling upon the pyre of the stock market. Whether it ignited into something more or simply burned down to ash meant nothing to me, it was the thrill that I craved.

This is decades ago now; I was one of the top bankers for… eh, it doesn’t matter, they’re not important. Not to mention that a series of severe fires has long since put them out of business. The point was, that I burned through too much of myself, because I didn’t know what else I could burn. My girlfriend saw it, though she had no idea how to help with the deep depression that had settled over me.

I never slept much to begin with, but… now even the choice seemed denied to me. I was sluggish and listless at work, and people began to notice. My rating began to drop. My colleagues would whisper, and not-so-subtly leave me off invitations for what little socialising there was. I was burned out in every sense but one. And that was the one that saved me.

It was Agnes, of course. I don’t know where she found me, I only remember sitting in a booth with a beautiful young woman who smelled like matches and incense. I was drinking coffee so hot it peeled the skin from the roof of my mouth, but I didn’t care, because looking at her filled me with every kind of heat. We were talking about sacrifice, about power, about… things that even now I struggle to fully understand.

She was soft-spoken and shy, and… I gradually became aware of other people stood around us. There seemed nothing remarkable about them at first: different clothes, different ages, just a dozen or so unremarkable strangers. There was something in their faces, though, a vicious hunger that I knew mirrored my own. And they all looked at Agnes with such devotion.

One of them, a round-faced black woman I’d later know as Sandy, squatted down next to me, and stared into my face. She made a noise of dismissal, and leaned in close to stare at me. She said, “I don’t think so,” and her breath hit me like a furnace. I instinctively thrust out a hand to push her away. But as I touched her face, she remained still, and instead my hand sank into it like softened candle wax.

I screamed, but if anyone heard me, they didn’t do anything. I could only stare as thick rivulets of molten flesh flowed down my arm and onto the ground, and Sandy’s body shook as though with laughter, even as my hand stayed encased in her warped and yielding head. I probably don’t need to describe how much it hurt. It would be a long time before I was able to use the hand again.

At last, I calmed down enough to pull my scalded, wax-encrusted hand from her head. She stood up, pressed her fingers to her face and calmly squeezed it back into shape. It didn’t look exactly the same as before, though there was no mistaking the voice that came from her lips. She turned to Agnes, and nodded her approval. Agnes, for her part, had been talking this entire time, I realised, and somehow I had been listening. I knew what to do.

Nicholas Tregenza was the one that I chose. I had other colleagues I hated far more, of course, and in many ways I might have even called Nick a friend, but… unlike so many of the others, he had a lot to live for. His wife Julie had just given birth to a squalling brat that he’d named Desmond – awful name for a baby – and he’d saved enough money to move away from London entirely. He’d just bought a house. When he spoke to me, he had hope in his face, and so much life in him, it still makes me smile to think about it.

I invited him out for a drink to celebrate his good fortune, got him drunk, and stabbed him to death in a filthy alleyway near the edge of the Docklands. He didn’t even have the wherewithal to look surprised. His skin didn’t yield as easily as Sandy’s had, but I suppose that’s what knives are for, isn’t it?

And just like that, he was dead. And I felt no different. I had a minute of blind panic – how could I have been such an idiot? I hadn’t even planned ahead enough to consider how I might dump the body. I had just been so desperate to stoke the fire I still felt sputtering inside me.

Then all at once, I saw the faintest tongues of smoke creeping around his body. In an instant it was burning, and I was surrounded by that smell of matches and incense… mixed with an oily smell like cooking pork. And as he burned, I felt my senses sharpen. My limbs were alive with searing energy, and my heart was aglow with love; the agonising, terrifying love of something that I knew must be a god. My god. The lightless inferno of desolation, of pain and destruction. My tears of joy were nothing but steam.

Nick’s body didn’t completely burn to ash. Of course not, there needed to be something to identify. After all, what does my god care about death? It was the destruction of his life that it hungered for, the agony and fear of his wife and child, those that loved him, so they had to know that he was dead. Killed and mutilated in a pointless and unforeseeable act of unutterable violence.

Then it was simply a matter of forging his signature on a few documents implicating him in some very illegal transactions to get his assets stripped from him. Oh, and burning down the new house, of course. And with each act of glorious, hateful destruction, I felt my god’s love embrace me, consume me, give me life. Any feelings of pity or mercy I might have had for the poor woman I fed from were cauterised.

Julie’s dead now, of course, though I do keep half an eye on their son Desmond: see if he has anything worth taking from him.

At first I channelled this new energy into my job and my relationship. Gretchen and I had never been happier as I moved from one success to the next. I think she realised there was something else going on, though. Perhaps she suspected how much my mind drifted to Agnes when I held her in my arms. I know she wondered about how I started keeping petrol in the cupboard, and about my newfound love of scented candles.

But she never asked. Never ever mentioned it. Perhaps on some level, she knew as well as I did where we were headed, but there are some things you just have to accept that in the end they’ll cause you pain.

I should have been caught, really. For all that it gifted to me, my faith did little to hide my crimes beyond ensuring they were scoured of physical evidence. And I know the police were investigating a possible serial murderer targeting people in my industry. But for whatever reason, they never gave me a second look. I later learned my new brothers and sisters of the Lightless Flame had taken it upon themselves to help hide my crimes, but even they are only human. Some of them, at least.

I know now they were simply guiding me upon the path to my true epiphany. All this time I was serving my god, but only for my own glory. But with each new gift, each renewal of the fire, I saw how lifeless and hollow it was, how grey and ashen my existence had become. It became clear that, where once I had destroyed to fuel my life, I now lived for the pain that I caused. And for Agnes. My sweet, hopeless Agnes.

And so I ended it. For all the agony and pain on Gretchen’s face, she didn’t seem surprised when I doused myself in kerosene and set it alight. I think she screamed. She must have screamed. But I couldn’t hear it. As the heat warped my bones and bubbled my flesh, all I heard was the loving exaltation of my god.

JUDE
Huh. I suppose you did compel me after all.

B-But what about, um –

JUDE
Uh-uh-uh. Try again and I will actually kill you. I don’t care what favours your boss might have done for me, I will tell my story to your smouldering corpse.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. I just wanted to know when it happened, is all.

JUDE
I met Agnes in 1989, and completed my transformation in 1991.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. I-It’s just that you don’t… I mean you don’t seem like you’re, what, in your fifties? Or – Or burnt to a crisp.

JUDE
Wax is remarkably easy to mould.

[SOUNDS OF DEMONSTRATIVE SQUELCHING]
[NOISES OF A HORRIFIED ARCHIVIST]
JUDE
[Laughs] Oh come on! You’re going to need a much stronger stomach than that if you’re going to walk this path.

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I mean… I don’t…

JUDE
It’s like you’re not even listening. You have your god, as I have mine. Feed it, fearlessly and without hesitation, or it will feed on you.

ARCHIVIST
But I don’t… I don’t… I mean, I mean, what do I feed it?

JUDE
I don’t know? You’re the one it picked. Not a great choice, if you ask me.

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t ask you. Look, is there anything else you can tell me?

JUDE
Yes.

ARCHIVIST
Anything you’re willing to tell me?

JUDE
No.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t suppose I could talk to anyone else in your, um…

JUDE
It’s fine, you can call it a cult. And no, they wouldn’t hesitate. They’re not as friendly as I am.

ARCHIVIST
Well, thank you for the… advice. And the dead end.

JUDE
Wait.

ARCHIVIST
Hmm?

JUDE
If you’re really keen to keep chatting to things that could kill you, I might know someone. We’re not on great terms, he’s closer to your lot than mine, but I know where he… exists.

ARCHIVIST
Who… What is he?

JUDE
Calls himself Mike.

ARCHIVIST
Michael?

JUDE
I guess Mike is normally short for Michael, yeah?

ARCHIVIST
Corridors, weird limbs, laughs like a… headache?

JUDE
What? No. He’s pale, got a big, weird scar. Smells of, um…

ARCHIVIST
Oh, ozone!

JUDE
Yeah, that’s the one. Hangs around with the Fairchilds sometimes.

ARCHIVIST
Michael Crew.

JUDE
That’s him. I know where you can find him.

ARCHIVIST
Where?

JUDE
Not for free.

ARCHIVIST
Okay. What do you want?

JUDE
Oh, nothing much. Just shake my hand.

ARCHIVIST
W-What?

JUDE
You hurt my feelings earlier. I want you to shake my hand.

…

Come on. It won’t hurt.

ARCHIVIST
Fine.

[SIZZLING, INTENSIFIES]
JUDE
I lied.

ELIAS
Tim?

TIM
Hey, boss. What brings you down to the dungeons? Your office just too full of joy?

ELIAS
Not quite. I heard you’d had some absences. Some unauthorised leave. I just wanted to talk it through with you.

TIM
Right.

ELIAS
Were you sick? If you’re sick you really need to call in.

TIM
Nope. Wasn’t sick. Try again.

ELIAS
Well, you hadn’t booked any leave.

TIM
No, I had not.

ELIAS
So, what happened?

TIM
I hopped a flight to Malaysia. Found myself a hotel.

ELIAS
I see. You were trying to leave us?

TIM
Yeah.

ELIAS
But you’ve returned?

TIM
I… I got sick. The longer I was gone… I felt weak, like, like I was losing myself. You gonna fire me boss?

ELIAS
No. I don’t think that’ll be necessary.

TIM
Of course not.

ELIAS
But let’s be sure it doesn’t happen again, hm?

TIM
…

You do know, right? I mean, you must know.

ELIAS
Know what?

TIM
About this place. About what it does to us.

ELIAS
[Sigh] Tim, this place is very old. It has all sorts of… idiosyncrasies and not all of them are good for the people who work here.

TIM
I think I’d prefer asbestos.

ELIAS
I’ve always found the best way to deal with it is to lose yourself in work. Personally, the comfortable rigour of bureaucracy has always helped me. Perhaps doing a bit of mindless filing will help distract you.

TIM
Yeah. I mean… maybe you’re right.

ELIAS
I’m sure I am. And no more unauthorised absence, okay?

[DOOR OPENS]
MARTIN
Oh, er, is everything okay in here?

ELIAS
Yes, Martin, very much so.

[DEPARTING FOOTSTEPS]
MARTIN
Right. Um, I was actually gonna to record a statement, if, if that’s alright Tim?

TIM
Yeah. It’s already running.

MARTIN
Oh. Oh, so it is. Why, why did you tur-

[DOOR CLOSES]
Right. Right.

Martin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording statement number 0130807, statement of Ross Davenport, given August 7th 2013.

Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
So I had to find a new gym. It was a shame, really. I loved my old place, and the guys there were some of my best mates, but… it wasn’t entirely my own decision. See, I recently decided to start taking anabolic steroids to supplement my bodybuilding, and the place I used to go had a very strict policy about them. Matt, the guy who ran the place, his partner had gotten deep into them, and when he had a heart attack, Matt blamed the steroids. Since then, you get seen with a needle or pill bottle that’s not a recognised supplement, and you’re outta there.

Still, I didn’t leave because I got caught or anything like that. I hadn’t even started when I left. I just felt guilty. Like it was an admission of failure. Eleven years I’d been going, all natural, and, physically, I was at the top of my game. I did well in competitions, I felt healthy, I was pretty much the ideal weight for my height, but when I looked in the mirror I still didn’t see what I wanted to. My muscles were smooth and rounded, not like the, the veined, bulging forms I idolised. Even when I spent weeks dieting before a competition, without an ounce of body fat, I, I just couldn’t get there. I’d reached my natural peak, and it wasn’t enough for me.

So, I did my research, and ordered a cycle of steroids online. I didn’t want to be unsafe, so I made sure I got a full check-up from my doctor before I started, though obviously I didn’t mention why. Everything came back fine, so all that was left was to find a new gym where nobody would mind me taking them.

This was harder than it should have been, mostly because of my own standards. Plenty of places had an ‘official’ policy banning drugs onsite and just didn’t enforce it. To me, though, the whole point of moving gyms was that I didn’t want to have to hide like a criminal, or pretend to think what I was doing was wrong. I wanted somewhere I could be honest about who I was and what I wanted to be.

Eventually I found it, weirdly enough, in the Yellow Pages. Online searches hadn’t shown anywhere promising near my home on the outskirts of Aberdeen, so I thought I might as well try the phone book. As you’d expect, most of the listings just pointed me towards the their websites, but I spotted a small, square ad box in the lower left corner. It was text only, and read, “Your perfect body is here. Become all you can be.” Followed by a landline number and an address about five minutes walk from me. So I gave them a call.

The voice that answered was rough and spoke in the sort of English accent that usually gets my hackles up, but when I asked him what the gym’s policy on steroids was, he just laughed, and said that if it helped me “perfect myself” then it was more than welcome. I arranged to swing by the following day and check the place out.

From the outside the gym wasn’t much to look at. Just the faded outline of a dumbbell on a grimy window, and the words “Weights and Cardio” just about readable over the door. I realised that I actually passed this place pretty regularly, I’d just always assumed it was out of business.

The door was open, though, so I went inside. It was a hot day, but the air in the reception was cool, tinged with that familiar scent of sweat, and something else I couldn’t quite identify. There wasn’t anyone behind the desk, and the computer didn’t look like it had been turned on all day. I was about to call out, see if I could get somebody’s attention, when I heard the door to the changing rooms open, and someone stepped out.

The man who stood there was, without a doubt, the biggest guy I had ever seen, and bear in mind I spend my time hanging out with bodybuilders. He had to hunch down to fit through the doorway, and was almost twice as wide as I was. Most of his body was covered in a loose tracksuit, and I could see clear stitch marks where it had been enlarged for him. Embroidered onto the chest was the letter ‘J’.

Despite his enormous size, his face seemed pretty normal, even handsome, with the sort of cheekbones and jawline I’d kill for. He smiled when I stammered out a hello, and asked if I was Ross from the phone. Sure, I said, and he immediately launched into all sorts of questions about my workout, what I was looking for, what safety measures I had for my steroids, that sort of thing. None of it was unexpected, and he clearly knew his stuff.

But then he started asking me some slightly more personal questions: why I’d become a bodybuilder, how it made me feel, what parts of myself I hated. It felt a bit… invasive, but I answered honestly, and he seemed satisfied, turning around and gesturing for me to follow as he headed in to show me around.

The gym itself was good, but nothing special. It actually didn’t have much in the way of cardio machines, but that had never really been my priority, so it wasn’t a problem. There was also quite a lot of old-fashioned gymnastics equipment: parallel beams, vaulting horses, high bars, all that sort of thing. It was a huge room, and to be honest, part of me just assumed that they were there to use up some of the space. It certainly had everything I needed, although I did wonder why we were the only ones in there.

It was the changing room that really struck me as odd, though. There was just the one: apparently unisex, though I doubted any women were members. It was decent size, and had plenty of showers, good water pressure, everything you needed. It all seemed perfectly normal, except for one thing.

The lockers were absolutely enormous. They came right up to the ceiling, which was easily twelve foot from the floor, and must have been a good two or three feet wide. Each had what looked to be a unique lock, and only a few of them had keys in.

My guide explained that every member of the gym had their own locker, and kept it as long as they were a member. I asked what happened when all the lockers were taken and he just shrugged. “No new members,” he said. When he shrugged, the fabric of his hoodie moved in such an odd way. It was fascinating, and I made a mental note to keep an eye out for him in the gym, so I could get a proper look at him.

I walked over to one of the lockers with the key still in it, number 31, and pulled it out. I looked back at him, and he nodded. The locker was just as big inside as I’d thought, and went back about five feet into the wall. Forget a workout bag, I could have stored my entire wardrobe in that thing.

After that, I headed back into the reception, and the guy took down my details, I signed a few forms and, just like that, I was a member. He told me to keep the key, and explained that he preferred to have membership fees paid in cash. That didn’t surprise me. I got the feeling that there were a few things about the place that wouldn’t pass any sort of official audit.

Still, it suited me perfectly, so I had no interest in causing them any sort of trouble. I gave him a big thumbs up, and he nodded, turned and headed out the doors, off down the street. It was a bit abrupt, but to be honest, I wasn’t sure he was all there, if you know what I mean, so I didn’t think too much of it. I did kick myself, though, as I realised I hadn’t actually got his name, so ‘J’ would have to do.

With J gone, it seemed like I was the only one there, so I got changed, and got on with my workout. It was a little bit eerie, being all alone in that huge room. I’m used to having the presence of others to motivate me, to push me further than I’d otherwise go, just to show off a bit. On my own, I found myself working out at a much more leisurely pace; I was more careful than I normally would have been, if only because I didn’t have a spotter.

The whole day I kept expecting someone else to come in. We’d get chatting, I thought, and I could maybe ask them to spot me, but the day slowly passed, and I was still alone. Occasionally I heard a noise from the changing rooms that I would have sworn was someone coming in, but there was no-one. Eventually, I showered, changed back, and headed home for a less-than-exciting dinner of chicken and beans.

The next day was the same, and the one after that. No matter when I went, the place was always empty, with no sign of J or anybody else. I wondered if somehow I’d been tricked into paying to use an abandoned gym or something, but it was well maintained and really clean, so someone was looking after it. In fact, thinking about it, I’d say it might have been the cleanest gym I’d ever used, although at the time I thought that was because I was the only one using it.

About five days into my time there, I finally met someone else. Her name was Marie Balandin, and she seemed just as surprised to see me as I was to see her. Apparently she had been using the gym for about two months and had, like me, thought she was the only one. She’d been off to see her sister down in Glasgow for a week, and was a bit shocked I’d turned up in her absence. We got to talking, though, and got on pretty well, so sure enough after a few minutes she offered to spot me.

Truth be told, I was a bit dubious she’d be able to keep up, but a few sets shut me right up. Whatever she was taking, she was a lot further along than me, and by the end I was struggling when spotting her. Still, there was a camaraderie that came from being the only two people in that weird place, and it didn’t take long for us to become good friends, swapping diet tips and theories about what the deal was with J, whose real name, she claimed, was Jared.

There was one other advantage to knowing Marie was around – it helped me ignore the sounds from the locker room. The occasional thumps and creaks. I could just write it off as her being a bit clumsy. Even when I hadn’t seen her come in.

Marie was apparently quite a big deal in some of the international women’s bodybuilding competitions. I’d never followed them, but she showed me a few of her trophies once. The way she trained, though, it was intense, driven. More driven than I’d expect from someone with so many wins under her belt. She’d push herself way past the point of exhaustion every day, and for all the awards her body had gotten her, it sometimes seemed to me like she wanted to destroy it. Often I’d find her staring at the mirror in the changing room, her gaze locked on her shoulders, moving them slowly up and down with a look of disgust on her face.

I didn’t really think about it too much, though, as my own steroid course was starting to show results, and I was spending plenty of time in front of the mirror myself. It wasn’t enough, though. I knew it wasn’t enough. I knew I was going to have to go on another course as soon as my body had recovered from this one. Maybe even sooner.

I don’t know how it would have ended if I hadn’t lost my phone. I don’t have much of a social life, so I didn’t notice it was gone until I was getting ready for bed. It must have fallen out of my jacket pocket when I’d hung it up at the gym. I wouldn’t have minded waiting until the next day, but it had my training diary on it, and I always spent ten minutes filling it in before bed. It was a small ritual, but an important one, and given it was just down the road, I figured I might as well go and see if the gym was still open. Since no-one ever seemed to be around, I figured, maybe no-one locked it overnight.

So at about half past eleven last Wednesday night, I found myself gently pushing open the door to my gym. It wasn’t locked, just as I guessed, and everything inside seemed quiet. I headed through into the changing room, and there was my phone, where it had fallen in my locker. I grabbed it, and was just about to leave, when I heard movement coming from the gym itself, and nearly jumped out of my skin.

I should have left. I should have turned right around and marched out of that place, but instead I felt a… rage building inside me. Whoever was in there, it was almost midnight, how dare they come in sneaking around like that, trying to give me a heart attack! I set my face hard, and walked through, preparing to give Marie, or whoever it was, a piece of my mind.

The lights in the gym were off, but I could see movement over near the gymnastics equipment, someone swinging back and forth on the parallel bars. It was a smooth, rhythmic motion, down and around and up and over, around and over, up and down. Sometimes the movement flew up, releasing the bars for a moment, before deftly catching them on the way down. There was no sound as I got closer, apart from the faint slap of hands gripping and releasing the wood of the beams. If it was Marie, I’d never seen her doing anything like this before. I walked over, and turned on the overhead lights.

It was not Marie, swinging round and about on the bars. Marie only had two arms. Marie had legs. And Marie had a head. The thing that swung and flipped and twirled around the bars was nothing like Marie, though its flesh looked human enough. It did have a smile, though, stitched… right in the centre of its torso.

I screamed so hard I tore something in my throat. I don’t know if it heard me. I don’t know if it even had ears. But it wasn’t alone, and the other things in that place did hear me, because as I ran back and out through the changing rooms, all the lockers were opening. What came climbing out of them had once been people, I’m sure of that, and they called to me, offering to help ‘perfect’ me. To help me achieve my ideal body.

J was there, standing his full height. A distended, jagged body bared in all its twisted grandeur, and he shook his head in frustration. He said something, I think, but I couldn’t make it out. It might have been “too soon”.

I try to remember some of them in detail, the confusion of limbs and joints and muscles, but all I can remember is the happy, joyful way they called to me. Told me that the pain was worth it. It makes me sick that a small, sharp part of me wishes I’d stayed to listen.

I never went back. I called Marie and told her what happened, but she didn’t believe me. At least, I hope she didn’t. Because if she did, then some of the questions she asked make very worried for her indeed.

Statement ends.

MARTIN
[Deep breath] The, um… the supplemental materials that should go with this statement, providing more details on addresses, names, and stuff, seems to be missing, so we don’t have any way of tracking down the gym, or finding out the name the business might be operating under. Not without a 2013 copy of the Aberdeen Yellow Pages. A bit of relief, in some ways. I tried to contact Mr. Davenport about it, and did get through, but he told me to… um, he… he… wishes no further contact with the Institute.

Melanie looked into Marie Balandin, though. In 2011 and 2012, she did really well in several IFBB competitions, but it looks like she disappeared around the time of this statement. No missing persons report was ever filed, but there’s no record of her anywhere after that.

The last official mention seems to be a police report filed on August 23rd, 2013, which lists her as a ‘person of interest’ in a series of animal mutilations on a farm about five miles west of Aberdeen. A bunch of sheep were found dead, with their femurs removed. Look, I, I know we’re not meant to speculate in these bits, but… well, I just… I wonder what she was planning to do with them.

There. Well, that’s, er… That’s it.

MIKE
You’re sure I can’t get you a cup of tea?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, it-it’s fine, really.

MIKE
Okay. You just seem a bit… jumpy, is all.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, I just, er… Coming in I thought… It’s fine.

MIKE
Grand. Er, okay, what can I do for you?

[SOUNDS OF TEA BEING MADE]
ARCHIVIST
Er… You’re… you’re Michael Crew, right?

MIKE
It’s Mike, please.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[SPOON NOISES]
[Leadingly] I’m from the Magnus Institute.

MIKE
Oh, you, uh, yeah, you said.

ARCHIVIST
I, er… I read… You feature in some of our statements!

MIKE
Oh. Statements of what?

ARCHIVIST
You… There was, there was a book? Er, two of them, at least. Er… Ex Altiora, The Boneturner’s Tale.

You, uh, I think you threw a guy off a skyscraper in Paris.

MIKE
Hmm. Last chance for that cup of tea.

ARCHIVIST
I… Where did you get that scar?

[LONG SIGH AS THE SOUND OF RUSHING AIR RISES]
MIKE
And I was trying so hard to be polite.

[THE ARCHIVIST ATTEMPTS A SCREAM BUT TO NO AVAIL]
Hard, isn’t it, trying to ask prying questions at terminal velocity? The air… it doesn’t… leave your lungs like you expect it to. I mean, I know you’re still sat down, you know you’re still sat down. But whether your body knows it when I decide you hit the ground, that’s… that’s something I haven’t made my mind up about, yet.

A little bit of privacy. Is that really so much to ask? I suppose it is, isn’t it? From you and yours at least. We have a lot in common, really. After all, what, what good’s the height, the terrifying draw of gravity, unless you, unless you really know the scale of what you’re facing?

Maybe I’ll let you live, allow you to drag yourself back down to your den, but… you need to learn some respect.

MIKE (STATEMENT)
My scar, wasn’t it? Always the scar. Ironic, in some ways, because that was one the few marks that was only really ever physical. I got it when I was struck by lightning, age of eight. I was playing outside with a friend of mine, and the storm just came on quickly. That’s really all there was to it.

Have you ever been struck by lightning? No. No, of course not. Not unless that’s what happened to your hand, but I’m guessing that burn came from sticking it somewhere it wasn’t wanted. And you still didn’t learn. Well, imagine a white-hot, stinging pain, your whole body becoming rigid, like for an eternal moment you’re frozen, you’re trapped in a statue of yourself with a thousand needles of agony just erupting through you from the inside out. I don’t know if it’s the most painful thing that can happen to the human body, but… beyond a certain point trying to quantify and measure pain, it becomes pointless. That point is being struck by lighting.

The part that always bothered me was how I didn’t remember it. Not really. The sensation’s still vivid enough, but it exists in my mind completely detached from any actual memory. I remember the feeling, but not the event. One moment I’m playing amid raindrops the size of blueberries, and the next I’m in a white hospital bed, that acrid smell still surrounding me, and these lines of agony just carved through my skin.

The doctors told me there would be no long-term damage from my accident. They, they were wrong, of course, but the damage wasn’t something they could see, so how were they to know? Sitting alone in my room, tracing the lines of electricity with my finger, imagining my pain travelling these branching pathways. I was obsessed with it, and every time my finger reached the end of the line I felt a jolt of fear, because I, I knew they went further, went deeper than would show on my skin.

By age ten I was reading everything I could on what had happened to me. Electricity, Lichtenberg’s experiments, meteorology. My parents thought it was simply my way of recovering, of processing my trauma, but there was something else there. I know that now.

Did you know that Lichtenberg figures are fractals? I didn’t, not back then, but as they travelled along the length of my scars, I sometimes think like my fingertips could feel it. When I was twelve, curled under my bed to escape the pounding of the rain against my window, the roll of thunder that just rattled my skull, I began to travel them once again. My hands ran down and along those jagged, discoloured lines, every branch, every turn, my nostrils full of ozone, my veins full of fear. And they didn’t stop. I knew where my scars ended, but… those I traced in the dark that night, they just went on and on and on, far beyond me and to somewhere that still flashed with that unspeakable white light.

That was the night everything changed. Before it I was odd, certainly, probably traumatised, and gripped with a terror of storms, but after that night, things were different. I think, looking back, that was when I called it. That was when it caught my scent.

It delighted in toying with my perceptions, making me believe a storm was approaching, forcing me to run for shelter or desperately hunt for cover without warning. In the dark it would stand beneath my bedroom window, the light flaring, flashing the awful brightness of sheet lightning across my room.

I could never look directly at it. The bright, arcing glow of its insides almost blinded me when I tried. It was almost a man, but I could never be sure. Its strobing, flashing Lichtenberg organs changed and flickered too fast. It… never hurt me. Not once in all the years I was chased by its… malevolence. Of course, I know why that is now, but at the time it did nothing to dull my fear.

I remember when it found out where I lived. I had dreamed that night of shifting, branching avenues of light. I travelled them so fast I could feel my flesh peeling away, leaving nothing but the coursing, buzzing pain within me as I ran down these hideous corridors, aching for an end I knew simply wasn’t there. I woke up screaming into the darkness. Walking to the window, I looked out over the tiny garden below. I was sixteen at the time, and the house I lived in had a small patch of green behind it, just fighting against the pressing grey of the city, the dull glow of the light pollution overhead. But where the back wall should have been, there was a small wooden gate.

I didn’t feel the cold as I opened the back door, and walked out towards it. My… my tormentor was nowhere to be seen, but the blackened edges of the gate showed clearly it had passed by. Was I afraid? It’s hard to remember now, but I have to assume that I was. I mean, I must have been. As I pushed the ancient hinges back to reveal this darkened forest, how could I not have been?

It stretched away forever, I think, or as close to forever as the human mind can contain. The trees were long and spindly, their branches bare and reaching, as they grew down towards me out of the sky, their roots pulsing upwards into this roiling mass of clouds; the scorched and shattered trunks reeking of ozone.

I found The Journal of a Plague Year when I was seventeen. I was lucky, I suppose, that it wasn’t anything worse. It infected the house, of course, brought it crashing down upon my parents in a collapse of diseased brick and septic foundations, but I escaped. And more than that, my eyes were opened to the powers that might save me. Might protect me from a past that followed me so brightly I could barely see it. But I knew that Filth was not for me. Buzzing flies and rot disgusted me, but they never spoke to my soul. I threw the book into a sewer, and began my hunt.

The Boneturner’s Tale was next. Found tucked away in a waterlogged library basement, and deposited back in another. I played with it, but when I tried to shift the bits of myself I thought might set me free, the only shapes I could form with them were laced with that horrid, hunting fractal. My experiments weren’t entirely pointless, though, they did have a truth to me. I learned that I was more than capable of killing, if it brought me closer to what I needed.

I spent some time with a small grey volume, I think it was in Cyrillic, that decided it was at home amongst my bookshelves. I couldn’t read it, of course, but… when it tried to read me back, I buried it on a lonely stretch of moorland.

Finally I found what I was searching for. In the back of a Chichester bookshop, I found my release. Ex Altiora. ‘From the Heights’. The owner didn’t want to part with it, a nasty, grubby little man who stank of sweat and self-importance, but I got it. And at last I had what I needed.

The thing that chased me, you see, it was an arcing branch of the Twisting Deceit, taken shape to follow me. But the shape it had taken more rightly belonged to the sky. To those same vast unknowable heights that blessed book wanted to take me. Falling had always held a special place in my heart, that wonderful border between terror and delight. When my parents would take me to the fair, I always found my way to the highest ride, the one that would just send me plummeting. It wasn’t simply the rush of adrenaline, but something, something deeper, something that just gripped my soul with this ecstatic horror. And I knew within that book was something that could not only release me from my pursuer, but chain my being to that rush of wind and vertigo forever.

I don’t remember that night in detail. The two most important events in my life, and I have clear memories of neither. I know it was the first storm, the first real storm, I had seen for almost ten years, but nothing else remains in my mind. There are echoes of resignation, I think, almost desperation. That can’t be right, though. What reason would I have had not to jump? Not to become as I am now. Perhaps I just didn’t know the true joy of vertigo. It doesn’t matter. In the end I threw myself into the arms of that vast emptiness, and I bound my tormentor to the book.

That’s… that’s all, I think. Since then I’ve embraced my new life; gladly fed that which feeds me.

A… uh, a Paris skyscraper, was it you said? I honestly, I, I can’t say I recall it in detail, but that does… sounds about right. Sometimes it’s hard to keep track.

MIKE
Hm. You know, that was… that was nice. I’m not, not usually the sort for speeches. That was… pleasant change. So.

[LOUD SOUNDS OF RUSHING AIR AND THE ARCHIVIST GASPS]
Off you go, then.

Er, he… It feels like, he makes you… Vertigo. Like you’re falling.

DAISY
Has he killed people?

ARCHIVIST
Er, y-y-yes. Yes, a few, I think.

DAISY
Does he need to see you to do it? Does he need to speak?

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I don’t know.

DAISY
Okay.

[ADDITIONAL SOUNDS OF KICKING]
Doubt he can do it in a coma. Now turn that off, and help me get him in the car. Don’t try to run.

ARCHIVIST
What are you –

[PUNCH]
DAISY
What did I say about questions? I said turn that off!

[SOUND OF WIND AND VOICES ARE SOMEWHAT MUFFLED]
DAISY
This is it.

ARCHIVIST
[Out of breath] So… so what now? You kill us?

…

DAISY
You think he’s going to save you?

ARCHIVIST
What? What, no –

[GUNSHOT]
[THE ARCHIVIST CRIES OUT]
DAISY
Now… let’s see the bag.

[THE ARCHIVIST IS STILL GASPING]
[SOUND OF ZIPPER]
DAISY
One wallet, brown leather, no cash. One packet cigarettes, Silk Cut. One lighter, gold, spiderweb design. One pocket knife… blunt. Huh. One set of keys to the Magnus Institute. And one tape record-

[VOICES BECOME CLEARER AS DAISY EXTRACTS RECORDER]
You sneaky little freak! You want to record this? Alright. I’d have to destroy it anyway.

ARCHIVIST
What, I? I, I didn’t –

[RUSTLING NOISES]
Pl-please don’t shoot me.

[SOUNDS OF PANIC]
Why are you doing this? Tell me!

[GURGLES MORE AS DAISY GRABS HIM ROUND THE THROAT]
DAISY
Stop… asking… questions!

That’s how you want it? Fine. You brought a knife. So we go through the voicebox.

BASIRA
Daisy!

…

Daisy, put him down.

DAISY
You been following me, Basira?

BASIRA
Didn’t need to. I know what you do here.

DAISY
He tell you?

BASIRA
He didn’t need to. You’re not that subtle. But I – I always thought you just killed monsters.

DAISY
I do!

[ARCHIVIST CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE]
BASIRA
Just let him go.

DAISY
You don’t know what he is. You don’t know what it’s like to have your secrets pulled out like teeth, just because he asked?

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry, I didn’t –

DAISY
Shut up!

BASIRA
Daisy!

DAISY
Don’t you… Don’t you dare look at me like I’m crazy! It got you too, or do you think we gave him those tapes because we like handing out evidence?

ARCHIVIST
What?

BASIRA
That’s not how it happened.

DAISY
No? You ask me to take a tape over to this murdering freak, and I’m all set to tear you a new one for it. But then I get the cassette in my hand, and suddenly all I want to do is deliver his tapes, and spill my guts.

BASIRA
So, so now you kill him?

DAISY
First him, then his creepy boss.

BASIRA
This is too far, Daisy. You know it is.

DAISY
He murdered two people, Basira. Maybe more. I’ve done one monster today, no reason not to do another.

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t… I didn’t kill anyone!

BASIRA
For god’s sake look at him!

DAISY
Then who?

ARCHIVIST
I thi- I thi- I think it was Elias.

DAISY
Yeah. Well he’s on my list too.

BASIRA
What if he asks?

DAISY
What?

BASIRA
You reckon he can mind control people. Make them tell the truth? Why not try it on Elias?

DAISY
…

He’s got, he’s got his own… He knows things. Would that work?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. I, I could try.

BASIRA
Daisy! This might be our only chance to find out what’s going on.

DAISY
…

Alright. But if this doesn’t work, you’re still dead.

ARCHIVIST
[Exhaling heavily] Yeah. Yeah.

What about Mike?

DAISY
Who? Oh.

Grab a spade.

Yes, I’m calling to report a crime in progress.

OFFICER
Sir, are you in any immediate personal danger?

ELIAS
Ah, y-yes, not immediately, but I will be shortly.

OFFICER
Sir, where are you calling from? I need –

ELIAS
Could I speak to your Chief Inspector, please? Tell her Elias Bouchard is calling. Of the Magnus Institute.

OFFICER
Oh, er… Sure.

ELIAS
Thank you.

Chief Inspector Kaugery.

ELIAS
Ah, yes, er, good afternoon. Er, sorry to bother you. I believe you’re looking for Detective Alice Tonner?

Do you know where she is?

ELIAS
I do, yes. Er, she should be here in about fifteen minutes.

CHIEF
I’ll send some officers over immediately

ELIAS
That would be wonderful. Much appreciated.

[STEADYING BREATH]
Statement of Barnabas Bennett, as given in a short letter to Jonah Magnus. April 9th, 1824.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
My dear Jonah,

You must help me. If anyone is still here, it is you. I know your work brings you into contact with all sorts of fantastical terrors, so perhaps you might have it within your power to save me from this place. And it was you who warned me not to cross Mordechai Lukas. Advice that I have, I’m afraid, disregarded.

It was a small enough thing, as I believed. A trifling debt I fell behind on. And when he met me in that garden, quiet as it always is with him, he demanded repayment. Well, I took it poorly, and laughed at his insistence. “Bring it before the courts,” I told him. After all, what judge would find in his favour over mine? He simply regarded me silently for many minutes, staring with such a cast to his face that I could feel my resolution beginning to falter. “You shall pay me,” he said at last, “in kind.” Then he walked away.

Let me tell you, Jonah, I believed myself profoundly lucky that day as my hansom deposited me on the steps of my townhouse, a mood only slightly shaken by the impression that, as the cab pulled away, it seemed to have no driver that I could discern.

I am lucky, Jonah, but only insofar as that I never married. Never fathered children. Never let anyone get closer than my brother. The pangs of loneliness I feel are no more acute than my general longing for the company of my fellow man. I have no-one whose absence truly pains me.

And yet here, in this empty world, I cannot but spend these nights, these dreadful, silent nights, huddled and frozen in some terrible fear I find myself unable to name. I almost think I hear the mocking joy of my friends, but there is nobody here, and never shall be again. I try to read, to lose myself in something that is not the absence of humanity. How is it that the books speak to me of my isolation more acutely than the silence? For every treatise I read on this world and its workings, the more I know I am to spend my time left in it without comfort or reprieve. With every tale of love or society I feel more keenly the absence of both.

I went to Egypt once with the Royal Society, to the temple of Ramses the Second in Abu Simbel. The place was remarkable, of course, but what sticks so keenly in my mind is the journey. Two days earlier, on the road from Aswan, I found myself separated from my fellow travellers. I do not know how it happened, but I spent two hours alone there, under the blazing sun, staring across the vast empty expanses of that ancient country. I revelled in the silence, then, embraced the loneliness like an old friend. But now that friend has devoured me, and I shall not emerge from its jaws. Not without your help.

And you must help me, Jonah. If anyone knows of what might break me from this dreadful place, it is you. I know that what is done by those I cannot see might be felt here – I have found glasses broken and pages torn that were not so the night before. It is my hope that if I leave a letter here, in your institute, you might find it, you might be able to save me. I have no other hope.

Please, Jonah, if you have any compassion within your heart, you will not leave me in this place.

Your loyal servant,

Barnabas.

ELIAS
Jonah Magnus did leave him in that place, John. He got the letter, oh yes, and was on good terms with Mordechai Lukas. He could have interceded, perhaps even saved him, but he did not. And it was not out of malice, or because he lacked affection for Barnabas Bennett: he retrieved those bones sadly enough when the time came. Bones that you can still find in my office, if you know where to look. No, it was because he was curious. Because he had to know, to watch and see it all.

That’s what this place is, John, never forget it. You may believe yourself to have friends, to have confidantes, but in the end, all they are is something for you to watch, to know, and ultimately to discard. This, at least, Gertrude understood.

[SIGHS CONTENTEDLY]
Let us begin.

[FOOTSTEPS ECHO AND THE DOOR OPENS]
MARTIN
Uh, sorry to interrupt, er, J-John’s here! And he’s – well he’s – He seems – He seems angry.

Um, [splutters] I actually think he’s brought a coup-

DAISY
Bouchard.

BASIRA
Easy.

ARCHIVIST
Hello, Elias.

ELIAS
Goodness, John. Whatever happened to your hand? And your neck?

DAISY
[Satisfied smirk] That one was me.

ELIAS
You look a mess.

ARCHIVIST
[Chuckles] I’ve had a hell of a week.

ELIAS
Martin, would you be so good as to fetch Melanie and Tim. I think it would be worth their time to be here.

MARTIN
Er. R-Right. Okay. I’ll just… what, go then?

[FOOTSTEPS, THEN DOOR CLOSES]
DAISY
Okay. Let’s do this.

BASIRA
Er, John? Do you… You want to get this on tape?

ELIAS
No need, Basira. I’ve already got one running.

Now, you have something to ask me?

BASIRA
Go for it.

DAISY
Before I strangle the grinning bastard.

ARCHIVIST
Elias. Did you kill Gertrude Robinson? And Leitner?

ELIAS
[PLEASURED EXHALATION]
That’s… That’s quite nice, actually. Tingly… but sort of freeing. [Chuckle] You know, even Gertrude never properly tried to compel me. I always wondered –

BASIRA
Just answer the question.

DAISY
Or don’t.

ELIAS
Oh, no need to worry about that. I just feel it’s only fair to wait for your colleagues, John. They’ll want to hear this too. Uh, it’s also very important to me, in a personal capacity, that you understand I’m answering you of my own free will.

ARCHIVIST
[Angry] I don’t care!

ELIAS
I know, but I do. There’s so much of this place, of ourselves, twisted by forces far beyond us. I just wanted you to know –

[DOOR OPENS]
MARTIN
Uh, okay, okay, so I’ve got everyone, but I’m honestly kind of lost as to what’s happening.

TIM
[Speaking over Martin] Yeah, I…

Oh, Christ, what is it now?

MELANIE
Er, yeah, same question, please.

ARCHIVIST
[Snarling] Elias here is about to confess his crimes.

TIM
What?

MELANIE
Oh.

Good?

MARTIN
Is, is that like, er…

ELIAS
Yes, I was just saying to John. It’s very important to me you understand that no action I have taken has been controlled. I have done everything because I wished to.

DAISY
Get to the point.

ELIAS
[Sighs] Of course, Detective. So. For the avoidance of any doubt. I killed Gertrude Robinson because she intended to destroy the Archives. And I killed Jurgen Leitner because he was… an unnecessary complication. Likely to tell John too much, too early.

MELANIE
Bloody hell!

TIM
Oh, no.

MARTIN
So-So-S-Sorry, that guy was Jurgen Leitner?

ELIAS
It was.

BASIRA
Daisy, where do I know that name from?

DAISY
Oh, the Yousuf case. An Introduction to Higher Anatomy.

BASIRA
Ah… Oh, god! And you killed him? You sure we shouldn’t be giving him a medal?

ARCHIVIST
Very sure.

MARTIN
And Sasha? Did you kill her too?

ARCHIVIST
Sasha died almost a year ago, Martin.

MARTIN
Wh-What?

TIM
Oh, god.

ARCHIVIST
When Prentiss attacked, something else, it… it… it replaced her. I still don’t know how, but –

TIM
Goddamn it! This is… [dejected, exasperated sigh]

MARTIN
[Splutters incomprehensibly] It wasn’t… Sasha?

ELIAS
He’s right, Martin. The thing you remember as Sasha was nothing like her. It toyed with your memory. If I showed you a picture of the real Sasha now, you’d have no idea who it was.

MARTIN
So that thing we saw…?

ELIAS
Precisely. It finally tried to kill John. Then Leitner killed it. Then I killed Leitner. And I believe that brings us up to date. More or less.

ARCHIVIST
What about Michael?

ELIAS
What about him? An irritant. Interfering because he’s bored, and he resents us. He has no purpose –

DAISY
Right. That’s enough for me. Even got it on tape.

Everyone get back.

[SOUNDS OF CONSTERNATION AS DAISY DRAWS A GUN]
MARTIN
What?

BASIRA
Daisy, wait.

DAISY
Out the way.

MELANIE
Now hang, hang on, I thought you were about to arrest him.

DAISY
Get out the way!

MARTIN
John, do something!

[INTERCOM BUZZES AND ELIAS CHUCKLES]
DAISY
Don’t.

ELIAS
…

Excuse me.

[RINGING THAT CEASES UPON KEYPRESS]
Yes?

ROSIE (INTERCOM)
Elias, there are some police officers here to see you?

ELIAS
Ah, yes, thank you Rosie. Er, could you ask them to wait a minute or two?

ROSIE (INTERCOM)
Yep, will do.

ELIAS
There. That should make it even easier for you. Right, Detective? I know you were planning to kill me, but surely an arrest is a consolation prize?

[DAISY’S QUIVERING FRUSTRATION IS AUDIBLE]
BASIRA
Daisy?

ELIAS
Oh, didn’t she tell you why she hadn’t gone back to the station?

Allow me. She rightly suspected that I held evidence of various murders she had committed, and that I sent this to her superiors.

DAISY
…

ELIAS
She’s quite the killer, your partner. All in the public good, of course. And she was correct, I spent some time acquiring that evidence. Or creating it. And while your superiors don’t much care about the killings, the fact there is proof… They’re not happy. And they want you brought in.

DAISY
Heh. So I kill you, and go to jail. I’ll take that deal.

ELIAS
For someone who used to be a detective, you’re remarkably reluctant to think things through. You think you’re the only police officer eager to do violence and call it justice? No, there are plenty of other rabid dogs out there, mad with the hunt. And some of them have signed a Section 31. There are plenty of others your superiors can call on to clean up this mess.

BASIRA
Er… they wouldn’t.

DAISY
Yeah. They would.

ELIAS
And anyone close enough to be implicated. They will kill Basira.

MARTIN
Okay, wai-wai-wai-wait, that’s the police that you’re talking about! Okay, they… they wouldn’t…

Would they?

DAISY
I’m sorry, Basira.

BASIRA
Yeah.

ELIAS
If the officers down there take you away…

Oh, but perhaps I was wrong when I called them. Maybe it was a false alarm.

DAISY
What do you want?

ELIAS
Collateral.

[PAPER IS PUSHED ACROSS THE DESK]
DAISY
That… What?

ELIAS
A contract of employment. For Basira.

BASIRA
Uh?

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
Oh, no…

ELIAS
Sign it, and I’ll send your ex-colleagues on their way.

DAISY
Basira, I…

TIM
Don’t do it.

BASIRA
There.

ARCHIVIST
Oh damn it.

ELIAS
Hmm.

[PUSHES BUTTON]
False alarm, Rosie. Could you apologise to the officers for me, and thank them for their time.

ROSIE (INTERCOM)
Oh. Um. Alright…

DAISY
So… what, you’re her boss now? Is that supposed to stop me?

ELIAS
Yes.

MELANIE
Um, I mean, she’s still got a gun?

ELIAS
Ah, of course. Er, sometimes I forget how new you all are to this.

Basira is now tied to the Institute. All of you are. Like fingers on a hand. And I am the beating heart of it. Should I, or the Institute, be destroyed, you will all, unfortunately, follow suit.

MELANIE
Wait, what?

TIM
Yup, that sounds about right.

ELIAS
And it would not be a pleasant death.

DAISY
Bullshit!

ELIAS
Then shoot me. Just squeeze the trigger, and watch the only person you care about die screaming. Your last connection to humanity.

Do it.

BASIRA
Daisy…

[DAISY EXHALES, AND EVERYONE ELSE SIGHS AS SHE LOWERS THE GUN]
DAISY
What do you want?

ELIAS
The police are not the only ones who can find a use for your violence. I’m sure there’ll be plenty here for you to do. Feel free to go where you like in the meantime. I’ll be in touch.

DAISY
You piece of –

BASIRA
Daisy, it’s… it’s okay. We’ll figure something out.

MELANIE
This is insane!

TIM
You get used to it.

ELIAS
Now that’s taken care of, if you’ll all give me and John a moment alone. I’m sure we have some things to discuss.

DAISY
Yeah.

MARTIN
Come on.

[FOOTSTEPS AND DOOR CLOSES]
ARCHIVIST
So.

ELIAS
Come on, John, there’s really no need for the scowl.

ARCHIVIST
What do you want?

ELIAS
Honestly? To offer some congratulations. You’re doing a lot better than I expected.

ARCHIVIST
Feels like all I’ve managed to do is… not die.

ELIAS
And believe me, that is a remarkably rare skill.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not getting any answers out of this, am I?

ELIAS
The easily-digestible sort that wipe away any doubt and fear, and neatly organise your new world into happy little columns? No. Not from me.

These are things you must discover on your own.

ARCHIVIST
Why?

ELIAS
[Sighs] What are you?

ARCHIVIST
I… The Archivist.

ELIAS
Precisely. It is your job to chronicle these things, to experience them, whether first-hand or through the eyes of others. To simply be told, well…

ARCHIVIST
It doesn’t please your master?

ELIAS
Our master, John.

ARCHIVIST
[Emphatically] I never chose this.

ELIAS
You never wanted this, no. But I’m afraid you absolutely did choose it. In a hundred ways, at a hundred thresholds, you pressed on. You sought knowledge relentlessly, and you always chose to see. Our world is made of choices, John, and very rarely do we truly know what any of them mean, but we make them nonetheless.

ARCHIVIST
[Signs heavily] So what now?

ELIAS
You were doing fine before you forced this little scene. I suggest you continue.

ARCHIVIST
So it was you sending me statements.

ELIAS
A little bit of direction never hurt anybody. So to speak.

ARCHIVIST
[Chuckles] Directed towards what?

ELIAS
The Unknowing. I need you to stop it.

ARCHIVIST
Again with – What is “the Unknowing?” Exactly.

ELIAS
A ritual. The Stranger and its kin attempting to gather power enough to bring it closer.

ARCHIVIST
They’re trying to, what, summon it?

ELIAS
Not exactly. These things that touch us, they… don’t have a form of the sort that could exist in physical reality. So the Stranger wishes to remake that physical reality into something closer to itself. It wants to make this world its own.

ARCHIVIST
And how do I stop it?

ELIAS
That is what you need to find out.

ARCHIVIST
No. You are not doing that. I know you have Gertrude’s notes, her, her files. She was working on a way to stop this. Not to mention that apparently you can… effortlessly see anything at any time!

ELIAS
Hardly effortlessly, but I take your point.

ARCHIVIST
So you obviously know how to stop it. You could just tell me!

ELIAS
I could. But I believe that if I did so, you would fail. The Stranger is antithetical to us.

[THE ARCHIVIST SIGHS HEAVILY]
We thrive on ceaseless watching, on knowing too much. What we face is the hidden, the uncanny, and the unknown. If you are to stop them, you need to get better at seeing. And my explaining things is simply not enough.

ARCHIVIST
And you can’t just give me all of the statements?

ELIAS
John, even when you had them all at your disposal, you barely got through one statement a week. Why do you think that is? It takes its toll on you. And I know you’ve had problems with moderation.

ARCHIVIST
So it’s… it’s back to breadcrumbs, and statements, and risking my life talking to things that barely remember how to be human anymore?

ELIAS
For now. I’ll be in touch.

…

[RESUMES WRITING]
Anything else?

ARCHIVIST
Am I… Elias, am I still human?

ELIAS
John, what does human even mean? I mean, really? You still bleed, you can still die. And your will is still your own, mostly. That’s more than can be said for a lot of the ‘real’ humans out there.

…

You’re worried about ending up like that thing, lurking in the dirt under the streets of Alexandria? Don’t be. Just do what you need to, and you’ll be fine. Understood?

ARCHIVIST
I suppose so.

ELIAS
Good. Well, I have work to be getting on with. I’ll send you a Return to Work form, but don’t worry about the doctor’s note. Now, if there’s nothing else?

ARCHIVIST
Right.

Statement of Lester Chang, regarding the cleaning habits of his father-in-uh… Er, er, right. Um…

[ADMIRAL MIAOWS, DEMANDING ATTENTION]
Hello Admiral, how’ve you been? I’ve missed you too. I just – I’m trying to…

[Sighs] Fine, you want a belly rub, alri– aaargh. Wrong hand, cat, wrong hand. Ah-hah… just… Sorry Admiral, it-it’s been a hard few days.

[ADMIRAL STARTS PURRING]
Hope I haven’t upset Georgie too much. How can she be mad? She’s got you. Er, yep, that’s your arse. Thanks for that. Look, I know, I love you too, but can I have my lap back? I kind of… I kinda need to – Aaah… Okay. Okay. Belly rubs. You don’t have to worry about all this stuff, do you? A bit over your head, I guess. Bet the world ends, and you do just fine.

[PURRING CEASES]
Oh, right. You done? Okay.

Statement of Lester Chang regarding the cleaning habits of his father-in-law. Original statement given March 5th 1995. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, H-Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
My father-in-law was always a fastidious man. When we first met, I made some jokes about OCD, but a few warning looks from Dani shut me right up. Greg Russell was very tidy and very clean, but balanced out, I always thought, by his wife Sandra, my mother-in-law. I know I’m meant to hate my mother-in-law, but honestly Sandra and I got on fantastically. Both of us were kind of messy, and found the chaos comforting and homely, and we had very similar senses of humour. I never figured out whether she and Greg complemented each other, or drove each other up the wall. When I first met them I was horrified by the way they talked to each other, convinced I was about to witness the messy divorce of my girlfriend’s parents. But twelve years later, they were still together, and I found myself privy to their more tender moments. To be honest, I’m still not sure how healthy their relationship was, but it seems to work for them, and Danielle, my wife, didn’t seem to have inherited any of their more confrontational habits when it came to our relationship.

All in all, I enjoyed seeing them two or three times a year on holidays, but was kind of glad they lived all the way up in Newcastle. Dani would talk to them on the phone for hours, and I’d get all the updates, but crucially, I didn’t have to do much of the interaction myself. And that was more than enough for me.

Then, last year, the… unthinkable happened. Hereditary conditions, right? They… They can really ruin… everything. The doctors told us the chances of it happening were astronomical, like we should be proud of having something so unlikely march in and ruin our lives, but within ten months both myself and Greg were widowers. I think I must have spent more nights that year in hospital chairs than I did in my own bed. But November rolled around, and I had it all to myself. You don’t realise how big a bed can be until something like that happens.

I don’t really know what I expected it to do to my relationship with my father-in-law. I mean, I didn’t really expect anything at all. If you’d asked me at the time, I probably would have said that it should have brought us closer together, that we’d probably end up leaning on each other for support. But that never really happened. Instead, he stopped contacting me completely. He still answered the phone when I called, but was polite when I went to check upon him. Every bit of communication had to be instigated by me.

And he had gotten… cleaner. I didn’t think it was possible, but every time I went over there, the smell of bleach was almost overwhelming. More often than not he was wearing rubber cleaning gloves when he opened the door, and as I walked around I could feel his eyes making note of everywhere I walked, everything I touched. I tried to talk to him about it, suggest he get help, but whenever I mentioned it he would try to change the subject, and talk about television or news, though… if I tried, it became clear he didn’t actually follow either.

Finally, I decided I just couldn’t stand it any more. I sat him down, and told him that if he didn’t talk to someone about his compulsions, I was going to have to set something up for him. I told him that whatever he was doing, it wasn’t the right way to deal with Sandra and Dani’s death. I didn’t handle it well. I was still deep in grief myself, and I almost broke down, pleading with him, telling him it wasn’t healthy. When I said that, he laughed. He actually threw his head back and laughed. It was one of the most unnerving sounds I’d ever heard.

Greg stood up, walked over to a small cabinet in his kitchen, and opened it to reveal row upon row of individually packaged miniatures of gin. He picked up one of them up and inspected it, checking the top and bottom, and examining the seal to make sure it was unbroken. Then, in one swift motion he opened the tiny bottle, and emptied it down his throat. He did this three times before he finally looked back at me. His gaze was softened by the alcohol, but it still looked like an almost physical effort for him to force out the words.

“There is mould in my drain.” That’s all he said. Not all that strange a sentence, all things considered, especially in that context. But something in his face, something in the way he pressed those words out through his lips made me suddenly feel cold all over. I made my excuses and left. He didn’t look up as I closed the front door behind me.

I tried to forget, tried to just move on and ignore it. If he didn’t want my help, then I had no business trying to force it on him. But I couldn’t do it. He was Dani’s father, my last connection to her. I don’t believe in ghosts, or the afterlife, or anything like that, but I knew she would have wanted me to do something. Dani never gave up on anyone.

Work wasn’t expecting me back for another few weeks, and Dani had had a solid life insurance policy, so there wasn’t any problem booking a decent hotel room for a week in Newcastle. I knew that my father-in-law would never allow me to stay in his home, not at that point, but he couldn’t stop me being nearby. So I started to check in on him every day. I brought him hot meals, and talked to him for hours, even when he didn’t want to talk back. But none of it seemed to weaken the cleaning compulsion that had taken hold of him. If anything, after a few days I noticed that I had adopted the habit of cleaning my hands a second time before leaving the hotel bathroom. Greg wouldn’t let me use his.

On the fifth day, I did see inside his bathroom, though. I won’t go into details, but suffice to say my use of it was over his protests. It was just as clean as the rest of the house. Beyond clean, really, as I could see some of the enamel fittings had been worn down, and the tile grouting and sealant around the sink were starting to corrode. I shook my head and turned to leave, but as I did so, I saw a small flash of colour in the bath. I pulled back the white curtain and looked down. Surrounding the edges of the plug’s pristine chrome was a small halo of purple. I leaned over to get a closer look. It appeared to be some sort of fungus, scrubbed away so only the faintest traces remained. There was a spongy, fibrous look to it, and I had the sudden image of long, soft tendrils stretching away down through the pipes. It was the colour of a fresh bruise and smelled sour, like old milk.

I don’t know how long I stood staring at it, but when I looked up, my father-in-law stood in the bathroom door with a look on his face that was a mixture of anger and embarrassment. He started screaming at me about privacy and respect, about how he was a clean man, and knew how to keep his house pure. He had a lump of wire wool in his hands, and I left quickly, because…. I was somehow sure that if I didn’t he was going to start scrubbing me with it.

I didn’t go back the next day, both to let him cool off, and because I need to spend some time convincing myself that I shouldn’t just head home and leave him to whatever the hell he thought was going on. I couldn’t get that mould out of my head, though. When I went out to eat, I kept thinking I could smell that awful, sour odour, and I ended up just sitting there, watching my burger as it cooled down, searching its surface for any signs of… something. At one point a fly landed on it, and I just found myself nodding, like everything was exactly as it should be. I don’t know. I wasn’t sleeping well; my sheets felt odd. Slimy, somehow, though whenever I turned the lights on to look… there was nothing out of the ordinary.

I did go back. Of course I did. He wasn’t well. I know I should have done something, forced some help on him somehow, but even now I’m not sure how I could have done it. Greg didn’t answer the door, but it wasn’t locked. The house was still spotless, but the cleanliness didn’t look quite as fresh as it had before. Like it had been cleaned earlier, and just hadn’t been used since then. My father-in-law was sat on the sofa in the same clothes he’d had on the last time I’d seen him. His skin was slick with sweat, and his face was blank. I called out to him and he looked up, but there was… no recognition in his eyes.

I glanced behind him, and saw the bathroom door was closed. Not just closed, but sealed. All the edges and the cracks had been packed through with sealant. He’d even nailed extra wood to the bottom of the door, and sealed all the crevices of that. It didn’t do anything to stop that sour smell, which seemed to pulse and ooze from the doorway, and as I stared at the edges of it, I noticed the sealant was laced through with thin tendrils of purple.

I turned to Greg to say something, to ask a question, but then… I noticed something. I began to realise that, aside from his head, every inch of skin was covered with clothes, with gloves, or a scarf. Whereas before he had been dressing to be sterile, now it seemed like he was dressing to keep covered. And then I looked into his face. I saw the thin crust of purple around his eyelids, the corner of his mouth, and the colour of veins in his bloodshot eyes.

He started to move, to open his mouth, but I didn’t give him the chance. I didn’t even stop to consider alternatives, I just turned on my heel and ran. Some people might call me a coward, but I am absolutely sure those people would not have made it out of that house alive.

I know I should have called someone, told the police or the ambulance service, but I was in shock. I didn’t know what I’d just witnessed. I still don’t, not really. I went back one more time, but I didn’t even get past the front gate before the smell hit me, and I turned back. It looked like my father-in-law was moving, though. I remember, it was Breekon and Hope doing it; they had a depot a ways down the street, and I recall thinking how odd that was, using a couple of local lads with such a small van, given how much furniture they were having to load up from Greg’s house. I asked them about it, about where he was, but they just looked at each other and mumbled something in Polish or Russian, and then they completely ignored me. I was going to press the issue, but I got another wave of that dreadful, rotten smell from the house, and realised I had to leave before I was sick.

The next time I went back the place was empty, the smell was gone, and I never saw my father-in-law again.

Statement ends.

ARCHIVIST
[Heavy sigh] Elias gave me this before I left. Said it might help me “clarify my next move”. I should really have waited, got some rest before I recorded it, or until I’d had a chance to move out of Georgie’s. I’ve already stayed here too long. It’s not fair, putting her in danger like this. Or the Admiral.

God, if Daisy had come while I was here…

I wasn’t sure what Elias meant by “my next move” until the end of this statement. Horrible as whatever it was that overtook Greg Russell must have been, it seems less than entirely relevant to the current situation. But Breekon and Hope? Speaking Russian and helping transport a victim of… whatever dark power rules over disease and rot. And insects, maybe? I was just about convinced that they served the Stranger, and their speaking Russian might well support that if it ties them to the Circus, but… this is not the first time they’ve been delivering things that seem to be tied to other beings. Are they a neutral party, carting round whatever horror needs delivering, just a piece of otherworldly infrastructure? Or are they fully part of the Stranger, just serving as allies of convenience for other things that need to be moved?

Most importantly, though, it mentions a depot in Newcastle. Sasha checked on the Nottingham depot when they first came up… huh, almost two years ago now. A different time. But that had long been gentrified into luxury flats. Sasha never mentioned there might have been other depots, and I never asked. I need to do some digging, because if the place is still there, if – if the building is still standing, I might just have an idea where to –

GEORGIE
So, what? You were just packing this away?

ARCHIVIST
Georgie, I just, I needed to do one more.

GEORGIE
I asked you not to record them here.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry, I… I honestly forgot. It’s been a hell of a week.

GEORGIE
Yeah, not just for you. What, you think you just disappear for five days, then turn up looking like the, like the end of Die Hard, and I’ll just write it off? ‘Classic John, what an interesting life he must lead.’

ARCHIVIST
No, I –

GEORGIE
Where have you been? And what happened to your hand?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t want to talk about it.

GEORGIE
Tough.

ARCHIVIST
Look, I’m moving out anyway, so just… just forget it. I’m out of your life. Alright?

GEORGIE
No.

ARCHIVIST
No… No, what?

GEORGIE
You leave, you don’t get your tapes back.

ARCHIVIST
What?

GEORGIE
When you disappeared, I took the tapes you recorded, and locked them away. Honestly, I thought I might need them as evidence. You want them back, you tell me what’s happening.

ARCHIVIST
Georgie, please… You’ll think I’m… You’ll think I’m delusional.

GEORGIE
I really hope so, John. Because right now I just think you’re a dickhead.

ARCHIVIST
…

Alright.

[Sigh] Okay. It started when I got that job at the Magnus Institute, you remember?

GEORGIE
Yeah, they do… studies on ghosts and psychics and that, right?

ARCHIVIST
More or less. Well, I was hired as a researcher, and that was fine. I-I enjoyed it. Nothing really paranormal, but life was… fine. It was good.

Then, a couple of years ago, the Head of the Archives, Gertrude Robinson, she disappeared, and Elias, my boss, chose me as her replacement.

GEORGIE
Why?

ARCHIVIST
What?

GEORGIE
Why would he give you that job?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… He thought I could do it?

GEORGIE
You were a researcher, John – I mean, that’s, that’s a long way from an archivist. And I know you don’t just have a Library Science degree hanging around.

ARCHIVIST
I – I mean it’s all the same… data and, and papers and stuff. Isn’t it?

GEORGIE
Not really.

ARCHIVIST
Uh… Well, I was given some assistants. Tim, Sasha, and Martin. They helped.

GEORGIE
Were any of them trained in Information Science?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t… No? I mean, I haven’t even got to the weird bit yet.

GEORGIE
Now, I know you talk a good game, John, but hiring you out of the blue as an archivist is pretty weird.

ARCHIVIST
Head Archivist.

GEORGIE
Well that does make sense, actually. In context.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not sure I follow?

GEORGIE
What I mean is, if there’s no-one above you, there’s no-one to point out you’re doing everything wrong.

ARCHIVIST
Look, can we put my professional competence to one side, please. Because I’m trying to tell you monsters are real!

GEORGIE
Okay.

ARCHIVIST
[Confused] Okay? Okay, what?

GEORGIE
Okay, I know monsters are real and I… assume there’s more?

ARCHIVIST
I… erm, you, you know?

GEORGIE
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Y-You just believe me?

GEORGIE
Yeah, I mean, it’s not belief. I’ve seen them.

ARCHIVIST
You’ve seen monsters?

GEORGIE
Not the time, John.

ARCHIVIST
Right, it’s… it’s just, I think I’m turning into one.

GEORGIE
Really? That’s… not great.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. Ever since I took this job, I’ve felt a compulsion to read out some of the statements. The ones that really touched the supernatural. And when I do… I… I feel them. I feel their confusion and fear. I tried to write it off, but… And, and I can make people tell me their stories. Anytime I ask a question, people just… answer.

GEORGIE
Okay, well that bit… will need some proof.

ARCHIVIST
Fine, er…

What is something you would never choose to tell me?

GEORGIE
When we first met I thought you were putting on that accent to sound more impressive.

Oh. Oh, John… I’m so sorry.

ARCHIVIST
Oh… No, it’s alright. I, er, I mean, I-I guess I did exaggerate it. It’s a long time ago, anyway.

Proof?

GEORGIE
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

ARCHIVIST
The Institute is… There are beings. Like, weird gods, or powers, or… something. They’re outside our universe somewhere, but they push through sometimes in the form of these monsters. A-A-And sometimes they choose people to be… er, servants? Conduits?

GEORGIE
Avatars?

ARCHIVIST
Avatars! But they end up getting these abilities, and they lose a lot of their self. Sometimes all of it.

GEORGIE
And you think… that’s what’s happening to you?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Yes. The Institute serves one of these beings. A-At least, Elias, who runs the place, does. Since accepting the Archivist job, I-I’ve been… different. A-And I can’t quit or, apparently, do any violence to him. I’m bound somehow.

GEORGIE
That does at least explain why he picked you.

ARCHIVIST
Uh?

GEORGIE
If your job is asking questions, I mean. You were always the one who pushed too far, and asked smart-arse, awkward questions. I always was surprised you never got punched.

ARCHIVIST
Well, I think that bit of luck’s run out.

GEORGIE
So, you’ve discovered your boss is evil, making you kind of evil, and you can’t quit, so you… fled here?

ARCHIVIST
And… there were some… murders.

GEORGIE
Oh. Ah. I assume that’s why I had the police asking after you?

ARCHIVIST
Oh, they came here?

GEORGIE
It’s fine, you were asleep. Anyway, that –

ARCHIVIST
Wh–

GEORGIE
– that makes sense, but it doesn’t explain the hand.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, that was… that was one of the other… ‘avatars’.

GEORGIE
Of your guy, or…?

ARCHIVIST
No, no. My… my patron is focused on knowledge and observation. Elias calls it The Eye, but I’ve also heard it called Beholding, or Ceaseless Watcher… a lot of names. This one was… The Lightless Flame, or, or I think she called it The Desolation. It’s burning, destruction, pain. All the bad bits of fire without any of the light or joy.

GEORGIE
Sounds lovely. And you were meeting them because…?

ARCHIVIST
One of the powers, The Stranger, is… Its beings are trying to perform a ritual they call The Unknowing. Apparently it’s meant to remake the world, bring it closer to their master. I don’t know exactly what that means, or where it is, but… I need to stop it.

GEORGIE
Jonathan Sims, are you trying to save the world?

ARCHIVIST
I…

Yeah. I… I guess I am.

But, but I need information, so I’ve been trying to find as many like me as possible. I’ve got a lot of leads: a weird Russian circus run by Gregor, or, or Nikola, Orsinov, and these weird van drivers that seem to turn up everywhere, and mannequins and taxidermy and skin, and all sorts, but… nothing solid.

Elias has been sending me statements, apparently to prepare me, whatever that means, but some of the people I’ve been talking to have been… very dangerous. I’m starting to feel like a bit of a punching bag, to be honest. Would be nice to meet a monster, and not have a scar to show for it.

GEORGIE
Well. Shit.

ARCHIVIST
So… You believe me?

GEORGIE
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

ARCHIVIST
[Exhales] Oh, thank god.

GEORGIE
John. These, these things you’re talking about? Is… Is one of them, like, Death?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, yes. I-I-I think so. There’s one I’ve heard called “The End”. Why?

GEORGIE
…

I’ll make us a cup of tea.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
ARCHIVIST
Right.

GEORGIE
Right.

ARCHIVIST
And… you’re… sure you’re okay with this? And with me recording?

GEORGIE
I mean… no? But… You told all your stuff, so… I mean, it’s just fair. I think.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, maybe I know something that can help.

GEORGIE
No, it’s not, erm… There are some things it doesn’t help to know more about.

ARCHIVIST
[Sotto voce] Right.

GEORGIE
So how does this work?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, you just… tell your story.

GEORGIE
Right.

ARCHIVIST
Would it help if I… ‘asked’?

GEORGIE
Erm… Yeah, yeah. Maybe.

ARCHIVIST
Okay. Statement of Georgina Barker regarding the last words of a possible corpse. Recorded direct from subject, April 29th, 2017.

Statement begins.

So… what happened?

GEORGIE (STATEMENT)
It was my first year of university, before I’d met you. I was still studying English at Balliol back then, and trying to hide how poor my family was from everyone else. None of them said anything, of course, but whenever they talked I could count the seconds before I got lost. Before one of them made a reference, or assumed something about my life, and I realised I was out of my depth. I’d learned what a punt was; there couldn’t have been that much more, surely?

I’d read so many books, and nobody knew any more about my subject than I did, but the way my classmates all seemed to read Latin, or reference philosophers I’d never heard of… I’d, I’d never been able to travel outside the country, but everyone seemed to assume I went skiing every winter. I felt I’d wandered onstage without a script. I felt boring, like I was being judged on all the experiences I’d never been able to have. And I always remember their faces when I’d get excited, and a hint of Scouse would creep into my voice. Like I was some sort of… curiosity. I was scared all the time, terrified that someone would see through me, see the fraud I felt like I was.

There was only one person I really felt myself around. Her name was Alex Brooke, and she was a medical student at Corpus Christi. She’d grown up in an ex-mining town in the Black Country, though I can’t remember which one, and she seemed to feel the same way I did. But where I was anxious and self-conscious, she was angry. I never met anyone who could skewer the pompous dickheads like she could. I think she actually head-butted some rich kid from Christ Church once.

She was a couple of years above me, and we met after we both went to some self-satisfied theatre thing in my second week. We simultaneously decided to ditch it halfway through when they started talking about the ‘highlights of the last season at the National’. We went for a drink instead, and just like that we were inseparable.

Alex was always so confident, so… utterly unafraid. I always admired her for that, even if I sometimes found it almost as intimidating as the posh boys quoting Latin. I think she made a point of never letting anything shake her. Even when talking about the most morbid subjects, she never lost that smile.

And as a medical student, there were plenty of morbid subjects to talk about. She’d discuss her dissections with me, I think just to watch me squirm a bit, and talk about how hungry she always got at the smell of preserved brain. Apparently, it’s exactly like tinned tuna. She liked to make that observation just before taking a big bite of her sandwich. I don’t think I actually ever saw her eat tuna any other time. Maybe she didn’t even like the stuff, she just wanted to make a point.

I’m sure you remember all the protests back then. I went on a few marches myself, so it didn’t exactly come as a huge surprise to hear that there was a group occupying one of the faculty buildings. What was strange about the whole thing was nobody seemed to exactly know what the group were protesting, or exactly when it had started. They’d taken over part of the Medical Sciences building, though, so I think most people assumed it was some sort of scientific ethics or animal rights thing. The staff were all very quiet about it.

Alex was loudly angry about it, as was her way. I wasn’t sure exactly what it was about, but reckoned I was probably on the protestor’s side, or close to it, but she was having none of it. Apparently classes were being changed all over the place to avoid that part of the building, and it was playing havoc with her schedule.

One night, when we were both through a few pints in Balliol bar, I mentioned that it was a bit weird there weren’t more police around, if they were illegally occupying the place, and she got this little light in her eye. This wrinkle round the edges that I knew meant trouble. I asked her what she was planning, but she just shook her head, and gestured to get another drink.

I didn’t see her again until the following afternoon. She called me up out of nowhere and demanded we have lunch. I didn’t point out that it was four. There was something in her voice that made me think she hadn’t slept, and not because she’d partied the night away. I pushed a plate of chips and sausage towards her, but she barely looked at it. Finally, she looked up at me, and I saw something new in her face. I saw fear. “They were just… sitting there,” she said.

Apparently, Alex had found her way back into the Medical Science building after putting me drunkenly to bed. God knows what she was planning to do; I don’t think even she was completely sure. Something about catching the protesters sleeping and bothering them the way she thought they’d been bothering her. She’d found her way to the rooms they’d taken over, and was about to go in, when she’d glanced through the small window on the swinging double doors.

They were lying on the floor, she told me. All of them. Not like they were sleeping, but like they’d just… collapsed, motionless, where they had been standing. There were no placards, no signs, just a couple dozen normal-looking students fallen to the floor.

Their chests moved up and down slowly, so Alex was sure they’d been alive, but… their eyes stared vacantly into the space in front of them, and everything else about them seemed lifeless and empty. Some of them were lying with their heads or legs at odd, uncomfortable-looking angles, but they either didn’t notice or didn’t care. They all seemed to have fallen away from a single, central point in the room. Kneeling there was the only figure who hadn’t collapsed.

She was an older woman, Alex said, and was almost completely naked. Her skin was pale and her head was shaved. Like the others, she was still, with only the movement of her chest showing she was still alive, but unlike those on the floor, her eyes moved. They gently swept from one side of the room to the other, like she was searching for something.

Then those eyes settled on Alex, staring in through the door. The eyes didn’t light up, they didn’t narrow, or show any sign they’d registered her existence. They just stopped moving and looked at Alex, as though waiting for her next move. And it was at that point Alex had recognised the woman, and run.

Obviously I wanted to know who the woman was, and I demanded Alex tell me, but she just told me to… Well, she said she didn’t want to say, and pushed her now-cold lunch away from her. I wasn’t letting her get away that easily, and I pressed the point. Who was this woman with the shaved head? Where had she seen her before?

Finally, Alex admitted she’d seen the woman during classes at the Medical Building. Was she a tutor? What was her name? Alex looked me right in the eyes. “They weren’t allowed to tell us their names.”

It took a few moments to work out what she meant, and when I did I felt dizzy. Alex had such absolute certainty in her voice, but she had to be wrong. It was impossible. I had no idea what to say, and all I could manage to do was blurt out, “Tuna?” She stared at me for a few seconds, then shrugged, and looked to the floor.

We sat there in silence for a long time, trying to understand what had just been said. I mean, there was no way that there could be something in a university building causing students to collapse, and nobody was taking any steps to deal with it.

Especially if it involved one of the cadavers, it just wasn’t possible. But the only other explanation I could come up with was that Alex was lying, and I just needed to look at her to know that was even less likely. So I did what I felt was the only thing I could do in that situation. I told her I’d go with her if she wanted to take a second look. She didn’t, but we went anyway.

It was Saturday, and the place was eerily quiet. Even without classes or labs, there were always a few students hovering about, going to and from places, eager to get some work done when everywhere wasn’t so crowded. But all we passed heading into the building was a single police car, sat empty, just slightly mounting the kerb. The door to the Medical Science building stood open; it was a bright day, but the hall stood dark. Alex looked at me, just once, as if asking whether I was sure about doing this. I wasn’t, but… I still nodded.

We stepped inside. The building was cool and quiet, with just the faint drone of the air conditioning in the background. I’d never actually been inside before, but Alex’s steps were confident in their direction, even if she wasn’t confident in her purpose. Finally, she pushed open a pair of doors to one of the teaching rooms, and… I saw the scene she had described.

There were the students, lying on the floor. But not just students. I saw faculty and even a policeman slumped there like the others. What Alex hadn’t mentioned was how grey they all seemed. Not in the sense they were sickly, but… like they’d had the colour simply drained away from them. And knelt in the middle was the woman. Her skin seemed grey as well, but in her it was clearly the colour of death. It didn’t matter that her ribs rose and fell like she was breathing, even if Alex hadn’t told me before there would have been no doubt in my mind what she was.

Her eyes settled on us with that same disinterested stare. No-one moved. Not us, not the corpse, and not the bodies on the floor. There was nothing but the sound of breathing, and maybe the faintest whimpering cry from somewhere among the fallen. Then, very slowly, without any sense of urgency, the dead woman began to stand up. I remember what it was like only vaguely, like trying to describe a dream long after you’ve woken up from it.

As the woman got closer, I could see something in Alex tighten, wind so taut that it finally snapped. She lunged forward, grabbed the corpse by its shoulders, and began to scream into its face. What did it want? What had it done? Demanding answers. The dead woman with the shaved head ignored her grip, leaned close to her neck and opened her mouth.

For a moment I had visions of teeth sinking into Alex’s flesh, of arterial spray coating the clean, white laminate, but all that passed between them was a whisper. Something soft spoken into Alex’s ear. Her arms dropped to her sides, and she turned to look at me.

Her eyes were different. They were still hers, and I could tell they still knew me, but something in them was gone. As my gaze met hers, Alex gave a simple, small shrug, so slowly, it was as if every ounce of will she had went into that one small gesture. Her head drooped, staring at the floor, and she gently lowered herself down to lie there.

And just like that, I was on my own. It feels strange to think that even then I couldn’t find the strength to run. If I’m feeling generous to myself, I try to believe it’s because I was unwilling to abandon Alex, or maybe the thing had some power to keep me there, but honestly, it was fight, flight or freeze. And I froze.

I saw the dead woman approaching me. Smelt the chemicals that kept her from rotting, saw her lean towards me, saw her lips begin to form words. In desperation I slammed my hands over my ears and shut my eyes, willing myself not to hear, not to understand. As far as defences go, it was basically nothing, but I still think it saved me, at least a bit. I still heard the words.

“The moment that you die will feel exactly the same as this one.”

And in an instant I understood. There’s no… difference between the present and the future, no other me that will suffer the indignity of death while I live on. It’s all a single moment, and there’s… there’s no difference between that last moment that ushers us out into oblivion and the one we experience now. The promise of a cold and lonely eternity in the grave would have been a mercy; at least it would be eternal. But everything ends, even the universe, even time. And… that means it has always already ended.

I felt every feeling within me boil up: anger, despair, joy, hope, fear. Especially fear. They overwhelmed me, and burned up with the monumental realisation of the scale we existed on. Not the meaningless vastness of the universe, but the… the smallness of it.

And I realised I was in my bed. According to my phone, I had been for several days. I numbly got myself some water, and ignored my weeping mother. She tried to hug me, but her arms just slid off my limp shoulders.

And that was my life for several months. Eventually, the memory began to fade, and I started to feel again. I took the year out of university under the umbrella of ‘medical reasons’, and by the time I met you I was, well, I don’t think I’ll ever be the same person I was before, but I had started being able to actually live again.

I never learned for sure what happened to the people in the Medical Science building, or the dead woman. Someone said a police van and ambulance had turned up in the night, and taken them all away, but I couldn’t find anything more on it. None of them came back to the university, and I never saw Alex again.

There was one thing that never returned to me afterwards, though. Since that day, I’ve never been able to feel afraid. My fear’s just… gone. I’m not foolhardy. I can still recognise danger, and I understand the likelihood of harm, but actual fear? Simply not something I experience anymore. And I’ve never been able to figure out if it was cauterised, or… if it was stolen.

GEORGIE
So that’s it.

ARCHIVIST
I see. That, um… I mean, that –

GEORGIE
Explains some things?

ARCHIVIST
A bit. I can’t believe you never told me.

GEORGIE
Well, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me you were on the run from the police over two murders, so…

ARCHIVIST
No, you – you’re right, I…

GEORGIE
Are you alright? You look like you’re about to keel over.

ARCHIVIST
Uh, no, I – I just… Ther-there’s been a lot of statements, in not a lot of time. I’m… I’m exhausted. I kind of wish I knew, uh, knew even one person who genuinely wasn’t involved.

GEORGIE
Maybe that’s why you thought of me?

ARCHIVIST
Hm?

GEORGIE
I mean, it’s been years, and there must be other old friends you lost touch with. Maybe you did know?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, maybe. I, uh…

GEORGIE
[Sigh] It’s alright, John, you sleep. I’ll tidy up here.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, I, uh… Yeah.

MARTIN
Right. Statement. Another statement. [Sigh] Fine.

Martin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording statement number 9770211, statement of Luca Moretti, given November 2nd, 1977.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
There is no glory in war. I learned that early. Maybe there was once, riding out onto the battlefield with your banner held high, a warhorse below you, and a lance in your hand. But no, probably not even then. It’s just fear. Fear that some unseen enemy might end your life from a mile away with a tank round or an artillery shell. Fear that you might look another man in the eyes the moment before he pulls a trigger and takes your life. Fear that you might have to look in his eyes before you do the same. I joined up because I wanted to serve my king, because I thought that out there, on the field of battle, I could be the hero my country needed. But it turned out I was only ready to kill for my country right up until the moment I had the chance.

They never tell you how difficult it is to take a human life. They tell you the enemy are monsters, an evil force sweeping across our fair land, burning and murdering because that’s all the enemy knows. They try to keep you far away, firing round after round from whatever hidden spot you’ve found. All so you don’t look your enemy in the eyes. Because they’re just people.

That’s not to say I never killed anyone. I honestly don’t know. A battle is a terrible, confusing place. I fired my gun plenty, and many Allied soldiers ended up dead. I can’t be sure none were because of me. But, I never took a life with full knowledge and intention. Not during the war, at least.

I wasn’t a fascist. I know that’s always the claim people try to make, but I honestly had no time for Mussolini. I’ll admit there was a certain poetry to D’Annunzio’s words, which brought me close to believing in him on occasion, but when he made way for “Il Duce”1 I rapidly lost interest. I had no time for that bald, pouting fool, strutting about and preening. I, like my father, served for the King. I wasn’t happy he had thrown his lot in with the Fascists, but loyalty was always a failing of mine. That said, I despised Communism, and under Mussolini’s rule the military enjoyed freedom and prominence as never before. I ignored, though, the rumours of what my brothers-in-arms were doing in Libya.

By the time the war broke out, I had been a soldier for most of my adult life, but I had never seen full combat, despite having made the rank of Maresciallo capo2 in the 4th Alpini. We were trained in mountain warfare, some of the toughest men I ever knew, and eager to see combat, even if to do so, we would stand side by side with Nazis. True battle was worse than I could have imagined. We were trained and equipped to fight in the Alps, in mountain terrain, but our commanders would send us against tanks and motorised infantry in wide open plains, with no proper cover or elevation. For all our leadership hungered for war, they had little idea, it seemed, how to wage it. For my part, I discovered that all my dreams of honour were only that. The war tested my mettle, and it broke.

When the King broke with the Fascists and signed the Armistice with the Allies, our erstwhile German companions wasted no time turning on us. I spent the last two years of the war in a Nazi prison camp, but strange as it feels to say, it wasn’t actually that bad. They treated us well enough, and having fought together, the abuse was minimal. It was only in the last few months, when our hosts were being pressed by the Russians, and resources became scarce, then we suffered. But this is not what I care to dwell on. It was what happened after we were released that brings me to tell you my story.

You cannot imagine the chaos immediately after the war was lost. Unlike Germany, carved up between East and West, Italy’s division was… messier. There was the South, that had surrendered with the King in 1943, and the North, occupied by the Germans for the most part, but some of our forces had still fought alongside them in Mussolini’s puppet state. To give you some idea of what I was returning home to after the war: Il Duce died in April of ‘45 and the Germans surrendered in May, but the official peace treaty between Italy and the Allies was not to be signed until 1947. The country was split, divided and bleeding. There was ‘interim government’ and ‘moves to restore order’, but nobody really knew what was going on. There was no debriefing, no official response to our release; I didn’t even know I was part of a military that still existed. I had to make my own way back to my home near Teramo, walking, hiding and riding in whatever vehicle had a driver who took pity on me.

I don’t know what I expected to find when I finally arrived home. Whatever it was, it wasn’t my old Alpini comrades, uniforms torn and fading, preparing what weapons and equipment they could find for an expedition into the mountains. My home was in the foothills of the Appennino Centrale, and many of the men I served with I had known since childhood. I was glad to see them alive, and they greeted me with smiles and open arms, but there was something tight about their faces that filled me with a faint dread.

I asked what they were doing, and their eyes fell to their guns. Deserters, I was told, in the mountains. Attacking people, and stealing from nearby villages. We were going to find them, and take care of them. I started to protest, sure there must be others better suited to the task, but even before I spoke I knew this wasn’t true. Instead I asked if the deserters knew the war was over; it was likely they no longer needed to hide. Again, a shake of the head, and there was quiet for a few seconds. It was Antonio Cannavaro, one of my oldest friends, who finally spoke up. The deserters, he said, had gone rotten. Not mad, or desperate. Rotten. Sono andanti marcio. 3

I suppose I could have left them to it. Turned my back on them, and tried to leave my war far behind me. But I don’t think that was ever really an option. I told them I was coming, and Antonio nodded his head. There was no joy in the movement. He was a huge bear of a man, was Antonio, but I saw his hands shaking as he checked his weapon yet again.

My father served his King in the Great War. He told me tales afterwards, stories of courage and heroism, of men fighting for the glory of their country. I now know these stories were lies. But when he was drunk, as he was more and more towards the end, he told other stories. Stories that didn’t always make sense. Once or twice he had talked to me about the ‘wild deserters’. These men, he had said, had fled from their units, but rather than trying to escape behind the lines, where they might be caught and shot, they would run into the battlefields, into no man’s land, and tunnel under the mud and carnage. They lived down there, so he said, desperate, ragged and barely human. At night you could hear them creeping around the battlefields, stealing what they could, and dragging the bodies of the dead down into their dens. If you were quiet, my father would say with a shudder, you could hear them eating.

I didn’t mention these stories to my companions as we started to trek up the slopes of Monte Vettore. They clearly had enough on their minds, eyes narrowed against the glare and mouths pressed tight. We didn’t talk about the war. There was no question I could have asked that did not risk breaking the fragile solidarity of our small band, but as I walked alongside them, I knew that each of them was dwelling on ghosts and stories of their own.

The first sign we saw of our quarry was a thin column of smoke ahead of us, clear against the deep blue sky. It was a mountain cabin, not uncommon in these parts, with a well-built chimney stack gently announcing its warmth. In front of the door sat a woman with coarse, dark hair, built almost as solidly as the chimney, and quietly mending a thick, woollen shirt. As we approached she looked up and we saw, in the middle of her throat, a ragged bullet hole. Her eyes were cloudy and unfocused as she got to her feet and began to walk towards us, blood still trickling from her throat.

I heard a scream, and it was so hoarse and inhuman I assumed for a moment it must have come from this half-dead thing with its ruined throat. But it was Antonio. His face was ashen, and for a second it seemed he was about to drop his weapon and run, but instead he barrelled past me, tackling the woman to the ground. There was an awful snapping sound, but her limbs still moved and flailed weakly as Antonio stood, and began to stomp down with all his weight. The others joined in, shouting or screaming, kicking and beating until the corpse was still. I was the only one left standing at the side, staring down at the beaten and bloody mess of… something. None of us said a word.

The silence lasted for about four seconds. Then there was the gunshot. It echoed around the mountain for far longer than it had any right to. We scattered immediately, instincts triggering to find cover. Too late for poor Alfredo, a small man whose sister I had once courted long ago. He remained stood exactly where he’d been when the bullet went clean through his skull. It was almost five minutes before he finally collapsed, but we watched for far longer to see if he got up again. He didn’t.

That was the turning point. Not the dark-haired spectre of death, but that sudden, unseen death. Uncaring savagery that could be neither foreseen nor avoided, only awaited. From that moment the mountain was no longer the place where we hunted. But neither was it somewhere we were prey. It was simply the place we were going to die.

We continued like this for several days. We saw no other signs of life, or whatever passed for it up there on the mountain. The only indication we saw that we weren’t utterly alone would be the periodic sound of a gunshot, as another of our number fell. The stark terror was evident on every face, but none of us even considered turning back. Something in us just knew that we were far beyond anything we could control, and if we were leaving this mountain alive, it would not be through our own decision.

By the time we found the cave, it was only myself, Antonio, and a young lad from the village, who should not have joined us in the first place. I never learned his name, but he’d been a drummer in the fanfara4, or so he said. Judging by how he held his rifle, I believed him. I would have laughed, told him he would have fared better with his drumsticks, but the joke died on my lips.

The smell that came from that cave was far beyond anything I had experienced in the war. The jagged hole into the cliff face oozed bitter, icy cold, and to call it the smell of death would miss the point of it entirely. It was the smell of our death. Antonio turned to me without a word, gripped my hand in his, and kissed me once on the forehead. Then he walked to the edge of the cliff and hurled himself over the edge. I didn’t look down after him. Truth be told, I envied him his resolve.

I walked into the cave. The drummer boy might have followed after me, or he might have joined Antonio. I never turned around; he was the last thing on my mind. The cave was a long way from natural, forming a smooth but uneven tunnel heading deep into the mountain. It narrowed slightly as I descended, until I was stooped, half-walking, half-crawling along the floor. The smell seemed milder inside, but I don’t know if it was truly less, or I had already grown accustomed to it.

The texture of the earth beneath my hands changed so gradually I barely noticed, and the torch I had brought was too weak to show anything more than a few inches in front of me. The first moment I realised what the tunnel had become was when I placed my hand fully over the cold and clammy skin of someone’s face.

I pulled my hand back with a cry, and pushed my torch down to focus on what was below me. It was a corpse, as I had thought. Its eyes were closed and its face was serene, but it was dressed in uniform, cut through and black with blood. It was Italian, I thought, but an old design, and not one I really recognised. Shining my torch around, I saw more of them, half-buried in the walls and ceiling. More dead faces, more uniforms, and not just Italian, either.

I pressed on, trying to find gaps between the bodies where it was still dirt, trying to avoid touching them. But those spaces became smaller and smaller, and the corpses were now piled two or three deep. It wasn’t long before the one way forward was clambering over them, climbing along their stiff, unfeeling limbs.

When they all opened their eyes, it was unhurried and deliberate. They were already focused on me, as though they’d been following my progress from behind closed eyelids. They were not cloudy like the woman at the cabin, but sharp and clear, slowly swivelling in their sockets to watch me climb over them. They did not move. I believe, though, at one point they started to sing, but that might just be in the nightmares I have since endured.

When I reached the end of the tunnel, the deserter was waiting. He had his rifle pointed at me, and sat in a tiny hollow with nothing but a small pile of soiled bandages and two dead rats. He was young, and so thin that for the briefest of seconds I felt a deep pity for him. The mud caked on his face had lines carved through it where tears had fallen, but they hadn’t been shed for me. He lifted his rifle, and prepared to kill me. I tried to raise my own, knowing with a perverse sense of relief that I was too slow. He would pull his trigger before I would pull mine. It was over.

But as I lifted the barrel to fire, I heard shots, five or six of them, ringing out in rapid succession. In the closeness of the tunnel, they were deafening. The deserter slumped. He was dead the moment the first shot sounded. Maybe even before that. For all his gaunt frame and emaciated body, he hit the ground with a weight that seemed to shake the mountain. I’d never before witnessed a firing squad, and I never care to again, although of course, I was alone in the tunnel.

I left the deserter’s corpse there. Left the cave and the mountain. Left my home and my country. Eventually I came here, and I never want to return. That is my story.

MARTIN
S-S-Statement… done.

[HEAVY BREATHING & TREMBLING AS MARTIN STEADIES HIMSELF]
I don’t like recording these. There. I-I said it. I’m sorry whoever’s listening to this, I know it’s unprofessional, but they f… I don’t like it. I guess we’re past professionalism now. Probably. I don’t even know why I’m still doing them, since John’s back now. Well, ‘back’ is a strong term.

[Sigh] I guess just nobody told me to stop? Melanie’s been asking about cases related to wars, so I thought… I mean, it’s not even like there’s any follow-up I can do on an unofficial Italian military operation from a period in Italian history where there’s basically no records.

[Sigh] John came by. He asked Melanie to see what she could hunt down about the owners of an old depot up in Newcastle, and asked me to get him a couple of books on taxidermy from the library. Then he left. Again. I mean, I’m glad he’s back, and I guess he seems to trust us a bit more, now, but… And – and I’m glad we can help, of course I am. It’s just what he’s doing seems really dangerous. And I get that he’s worried about us. I mean, we worry about him as well.

I worry.

And we should just –

BASIRA
Could you pass me that pen?

[NERVOUS, SURPRISED SPLUTTERING]
MARTIN
Oh, er… Hi Basira…

Um, how long have you been there?

BASIRA
Erm, I don’t know. Couple of hours? Why?

MARTIN
Y-you didn’t say anything.

BASIRA
Yeah, I was reading.

[MARTIN CLEARS HIS THROAT]
Did you need me?

MARTIN
No… erm, I just… er, feel a bit… self-conscious?

BASIRA
About what?

MARTIN
Well, I was just, doing a statement and notes and…

BASIRA
Ah. Was it… good?

MARTIN
You weren’t listening?

BASIRA
No, I was reading.

MARTIN
I just…

BASIRA
Erm, do you want me to find somewhere else to read? Somewhere more… I dunno, obvious?

MARTIN
No, sorry, you just surprised me, is all.

BASIRA
Sorry.

MARTIN
It’s okay.

What are you reading?

BASIRA
Introduction to Alchemy. It’s, um, really interesting, actually – you know a lot of the symbols people use come from astrology and alchemy. Like the symbol everyone thinks is the female symbol is actually the old astrological sign for Venus, which means it also means copper in alchemy. Which is kind of… What?

MARTIN
Nothing… [nervous laugh] you just… You’ve been reading a different book every time I’ve seen you for the last week.

BASIRA
Well, it’s my job now.

MARTIN
Kinda thought your job was to be a hostage.

BASIRA
I mean, I guess, but… what? You want me to just sit, and mope around? There’s a huge library up there…. and this stuff is kind of fascinating.

MARTIN
Shouldn’t you be, I don’t know, trying to escape?

BASIRA
Sure. How’s that gone for you?

MARTIN
What?

BASIRA
The way Tim tells it, we’re all in the same boat here. So, how’s your escape plan coming?

[NOISES OF CONFUSED EXASPERATION]
MARTIN
How… Doesn’t it bother you?!

BASIRA
Of course it bothers me, but so do a lot of things I can’t change. So you make the best of things.

And, hey, you never know, maybe there’s something in these books that can help us.

MARTIN
That’s… huh, that’s not a bad point, actually.

BASIRA
…

So, er… Do you want me to move?

MARTIN
No, no, I’m just about done. You keep reading.

Statement of Alfred Breekon, regarding a new pair of workers at his delivery company. Original statement given May 15th, 1996. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Three years. It was three years ago when they arrived. It wasn’t much, the little delivery company I’d built up, poured my heart and soul into. I don’t know why they wanted it. But they did. “Breekon and Sons”, I’d always wanted to call it, but I was always unlucky when it came to love, so in the end I called it “Breekon and Hope”. Just my own little joke. Backfired on me plenty; everyone always asking if I had to run things by “my partner”, and often I was too awkward to correct them. I sometimes used to disappear into the back room, pretend I was making a call to “Hope”. It was harmless enough, though, and the company was growing well. We had opened a few new depots, and had a few dozen drivers, making deliveries anywhere from Aberdeen to Penzance. Life was pretty good, to be honest.

When they turned up at my office, I remember it was their shadows that I saw first. It was early evening, and the sun wasn’t shining in through the window, but still their shadows fell across my desk, thick and dark as they loomed over me in the half-light. They wore featureless grey overalls, and even now I’m not sure I could easily describe what they look like, other than to say they seemed solid. Somehow heavier than the world around them. They stared down at me, dark eyes sizing me up as I coughed gently, and asked if I could help them.

They traded a few words between them in another language, I think it was Russian, before turning back to look at me. At this point I was pretty sure these guys must be Mafia, probably trying to shake me down, so I waited until it was clear what they wanted from me. But the silence just stretched on and on and on, and eventually I cracked; held out my hand: “Arthur Breekon at your service. Who might you be?”

There was another pause, shorter this time, before the slightly taller of the two – at least, I think one was taller – turned to his companion and opened his mouth. “Breekon at your service. Who might you be?” Instead of the Russian accent I had expected, he spoke in a broad, cartoonish Cockney that I assumed must be a mocking impression of my own voice. I began to stand up, to tell these jokers to get out of my office, but as I did, the shorter one turned to his companion, and in a similar voice replied, “The name’s Hope. What can I do for ya?”

I don’t know why this shook me so much, but it stopped me right in my tracks. I just watched as they repeated these two phrases back and forth between themselves, introductions made over and over again. Finally they stopped, and turned back to me. I had no idea what was going to happen or what I was meant to do, but there was something profoundly unnatural about these two figures, and I had no intention of pushing too far and finding out what it was.

It was a sunny day in June, and the window was open to a bright field behind the building. I didn’t notice the butterfly until it had landed on the one who kept calling himself ‘Hope’. With a slow, languid motion he picked it up. He looked at it for a couple of seconds, then looked at me. Then he ate the butterfly. Not slowly, or particularly fast. He just placed it carefully in his mouth and began to chew.

As his partner did this, the one who seemed to have taken my name held out his hand to me. “Keys,” he said, this time the word still lightly accented with Russian. I gave them to him. I took the keys to the oldest of the vans, and just handed them over. Anything to get them out of my office. I’m not a small man, you understand, and I’m not used to feeling intimidated. I got into plenty of scrapes when I was young, and there was a small part of me screaming to teach these disrespectful punks a lesson. But when this other Breekon took the key from me, what I felt beneath the skin of his hand convinced me I had made the right choice. Then they turned and left.

I wish I could say that was the last I saw of them, that they stole one of my vans and drove away, never to return. But they did return. And even worse, they started to make deliveries.

They were innocuous at first; the right things delivered to the right people on time. Then it became the right things delivered to the wrong people. Then the wrong things being delivered. Then the very wrong things. Strange folk began coming around asking for Breekon and Hope, and when I told them who I was, they just shook their heads, and I knew who they were after, They often brought crates or boxes with them and, once, a sack full of hair. I never opened any of these, or looked too closely when they came around. There was something in me that wanted to believe if I was smart, and kept my head down, maybe I could somehow get through it. I couldn’t accept that something like this could just turn up, and casually destroy me without cause.

If there was a reason they’ve picked me, I have never found out. I have asked them, but unsurprisingly got no answers. There must be other delivery companies, surely, and it was the deliveries they seem to focus on. They’re out most of the day and night, usually, allowing me some rest away from their horrid blank faces. But they always come back. When not on delivery, they stand in the break room, facing the wall. Sometimes they laugh, suddenly and abruptly, as though they’ve both simultaneously thought of a hilarious joke. It sounds like the laugh track in an old sitcom, and cuts off almost immediately. When I get fitful sleep in the small fold-out cot I keep in my office, I can sense them standing there, looking at me. I don’t go home anymore. I’m afraid of what might happen if they followed me outside of a professional environment. My other drivers have been disappearing.

For all that, they do seem to have friends, or at the very least, people who come to see them regularly. Most I don’t remember, the features difficult to put together from memory, but I know that more than once I’ve seen the pair of them talking to a figure at the other end of the depot. They always make sure these meetings are in shadow, and I can never get close enough to see exactly who they’re talking to, but I think they’re dressed like a circus ringmaster.

And so it’s been going for the last couple of years. I think I might even be paying them, though it’s hard to tell. The account book, as well as the shipping logs and manifests, keeps filling up with entries I don’t remember, although it is definitely my handwriting.

I am not sure how long this might continue for. Maybe years. Maybe forever. Whatever fight was in me at the beginning is gone. Occasionally, when they first began to take over, I would start to march up to them, my mind whirring, filled with demands and threats and ultimatums. Then they’d look at me with those blank, impassive eyes, and I’d feel all my resolve simply melt away. Now it’s just a memory. A daydream. I’ve forgotten the taste of determination. It won’t last forever, though, because I think they’ve decided they’re done with me.

I came into work yesterday to find a box sat on my desk. The address and label had been completely scribbled over in black marker pen, and it was impossible to tell from what was left where it had originally been sent to. It didn’t matter, though, because on top of it, written in my handwriting with a vicious precision I’ve always lacked, were the words: “Return to Sender”. They’d put it there for me. They’d never delivered to me before. The package was still, but every part of me recoiled from it. I slowly walked forward and touched it, but I did not pull away the tape. The day was warm but the box was ice cold, and the cardboard was spongy and strangely yielding. It didn’t move when I pressed it with my hand, but there was a sound like shifting sand. I don’t know what was inside. I don’t know what is inside. It won’t be right. It’s not my package. I didn’t send it.

I tried to look it up in the logs. I found it easily enough. Everything seemed to be in order, except the item description. That line simply read, “Goodbye”. God knows how long I spent staring at it. Nothing about that box was right. The card fitted together at slightly-off angles, and the corners were damp, like it had been left out in the rain. The table seemed to bend slightly under its weight, yet when I tried to move it, it seemed so light I doubted for a second it could have anything inside. Even then, I never dared to fully lift it up or pull it towards me. There’s a gravity there, though, and I don’t know how much longer I can resist its pull.

My brother came to you people about ten years ago. He had been having visions of demons and witches, and came to discuss them with you. He never recovered, but he always told me that there was little quite as freeing as making a statement for you. So I snuck away. But I need to be back soon. It has been freeing, talking to you, but not enough to free me from my fate. I am not the sender, but I am going to open that package. I know I leave Breekon and Hope Deliveries in safe hands. Safe hands where the skin feels wrong.

Statement ends.

ARCHIVIST
I found Mr. Breekon. The real one. It’s strange, for all he talks of worrying that what’s in the box will get him, all the bite marks appeared to be coming from the inside going out.

What does it mean when death no longer fazes you, even the most grotesque? Perhaps it’s a sign I’m adapting to my new situation. Useful, I suppose, but…

I was right about the Newcastle depot. It’s still here, and it seems like it’s been deserted for a long time. There’s a pile of mail at the door almost two feet high, and today it was topped with a crisp brown envelope addressed to me, containing this statement. A gift from Elias, no doubt. He could have sent this to me any time, filled me in on Breekon and Hope, but no. I had to find it myself, just in time for him to show me he knew all about it. Cocky prick.

Still, there’s not actually as much information here as I’d hoped, either here or in the statement. It shows that Breekon and Hope didn’t own the company, I guess. That those aren’t their real names. It does seem to confirm that they have some connection to the Circus, judging by clandestine meetings with someone apparently dressed as a ringmaster – as if it’s not obvious if you’re dressed as a ringmaster! And their apparent Russian origins. I say ‘origins’, perhaps… perhaps it’s just the last link in a very long chain. If the Circus is connected as closely to the Stranger and the Unknowing as I believe, I should probably keep an eye out for delivery vans.

The other useful thing I found here was one of the old log books. It lists deliveries quite a ways past the point where the company technically ceased to exist, right up to 2013. I need to go through it in more detail, but probably not here. This place… this place is done with its story. It’s just… empty.

I don’t like it.

Shut up. I’ve –

[Exasperated] You’re recording again?

ARCHIVIST
What? It’s hardly your first crime on tape, and if we’re going to question her…

DAISY
Is that what we’re doing?

SARAH
You’re making a mistake, is what you’re doing.

ARCHIVIST
Ohhh…. You thought we were going to, er, y’know, kill her.

DAISY
El-Elias didn’t say.

ARCHIVIST
No, he doesn’t, uh… He’s not big on micromanagement.

SARAH
It’s Elias now, then?

ARCHIVIST
[Whispering] What?

DAISY
Get on with it.

ARCHIVIST
Not a fan of taxidermy?

DAISY
Don’t like wasting time.

SARAH
Last chance.

ARCHIVIST
I… I really don’t want to be interrogating her where those… a-animals can see us.

DAISY
They’re dead. They can’t see us.

[SARAH SNORTS]
ARCHIVIST
Yeah, it would just be a bad idea.

[Deep breath] What’s your name?

SARAH
Sarah Baldwin.

ARCHIVIST
Are you the same Sarah Baldwin that disappeared in Edinburgh in August 2006?

SARAH
Some of her. Skin. A few memories. Not on the inside.

DAISY
Hand us that knife, and I can check. Smells rank enough already.

ARCHIVIST
No, not… not yet.

Did you go as part of a filming expedition to the Cambridge Military Hospital?

SARAH
A mistake. Thought I’d have fun with some over-curious idiots, but it turned out I had trespassed. I paid for it.

ARCHIVIST
So, what, now you sell dead animals? What is this place?

SARAH
The Trophy Room. A taxidermist shop in Barnet.

It says above the door. Surprised to meet an Archivist who can’t read.

ARCHIVIST
No, I –

[DAISY LAUGHS]
DAISY
Nice.

ARCHIVIST
Why are you here? You and Daniel Rawlings and, I assume the others taken by that… mimic thing.

The anglerfish.

SARAH
It’s where we were told to be.

ARCHIVIST
What is it? The thing that stole you?

SARAH
It doesn’t have a name.

ARCHIVIST
What did it do to you?

SARAH
Exactly what you think.

…

They always suffer.

DAISY
How do we kill it?

SARAH
[Derisively] You don’t.

ARCHIVIST
There are, er… there, there are dozens of deliveries recorded here by Breekon and Hope. What were they delivering? What is the significance of this place?

SARAH
Nothing, except what people give it. But they give it a lot, make it a place of power for us. Enough to keep certain items here. The couriers brought them, and took them, and moved them where they needed to be.

ARCHIVIST
What items? What was stored here?

SARAH
Books, relics, but nothing since the skin.

ARCHIVIST
The… The skin. The, er… [burbles] The ancient taxidermy. The-the one that, erm… Scaplehorn.

The one he saw.

SARAH
I-I don’t know who that is.

ARCHIVIST
He was a-a tax inspector. He came here, and Daniel Rawlings, or his replacement, showed him something he claimed to be the oldest piece of taxidermy in the world. Gorilla skin from Carthage.

SARAH
Heh, was this when you sent your ‘Sasha’ to interrogate us?

ARCHIVIST
Don’t you dare talk about –

DAISY
Sims. Sims. Shut up and focus.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Right.

Is the skin important?

SARAH
Yes.

ARCHIVIST
For the Unknowing?

SARAH
Yes.

ARCHIVIST
And where is it now?

SARAH
[Surprised] You have it.

ARCHIVIST
I… W-what?

SARAH
You don’t know?

ARCHIVIST
What do you mean I have it?

SARAH
The old woman, the one before you. She stole it. She killed Daniel, and took it.

Statement of Jackson Ellis, regarding the geographical oddities in the town of Bucoda, Washington. Original statement given 3rd March, 2009. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Last year I moved to the small town of Bucoda, about 15 miles outside of Olympia in the State of Washington. I’d never heard of the town before, and I certainly had no idea about what I would soon start to think of as… ‘The Pit’. The choice to move was not entirely mine, as my circumstances had driven me into a very particular situation. I had moved out to Olympia from Pittsburgh to pursue what appeared to be a very promising job as a correspondent for a regional newspaper. There weren’t a lot of opportunities in my field, so when I was offered the position in Olympia, I had used all my savings to make the move.

I never got the full story on why the paper closed down so quickly. One person told me they’d gone bankrupt due to embezzlement at a high level, another claimed there was a huge libel suit and they’d lost it badly, and a third said the decision had been made by their parent company without warning. Whatever the reason, I turned up to my first day of work to find the office halfway through being disassembled. I hadn’t technically started my job yet, so there was no redundancy or severance. I was just… stranded in Olympia with no money and no obvious place to go. It didn’t help matters that my new landlord proved entirely unsympathetic to my situation. Since, even if I got a new job immediately, I’d be unable to make the next rent payment on the rather overpriced apartment in the city centre. He told me I was in breach of contract, and was to be evicted. He gave me three days.

So, I ended up in a place where I desperately needed to find somewhere very cheap to live, very quickly. Somewhere I could stay while I looked for another job. My parents were dirt poor themselves, and couldn’t help. I mean, I’m sure they’d have taken me back in, but I didn’t have the money to travel across half the country, especially not with all my stuff. You never realise how many possessions you have until you find them weighing you down, or how little value most of them have to anyone but you. I sold what I could, but I got less than fifty dollars, and had barely got rid of anything.

So when I got chatting to Tommy in a bar, two days before I was getting kicked out, and he told me he had a spare room he was looking to rent out on the cheap, I said yes almost before he’d given me any details about it. Thomas Krycek was young, blandly handsome, and not desperately bright. He seemed like a good sort, though. He’d bought a small one-storey home in the town of Bucoda with his partner a few years ago, but she’d split a month or two before, and now he was struggling to keep up the payments on the house. It wasn’t much, but it fit what might generously be called my ‘budget’, and Bucoda was less than an hour’s drive from Olympia, so commuting in to any job I might actually get wouldn’t be too bad. I shook his hand, and I moved there.

The town was almost exactly what you would expect. A small grid without traffic signs or markings, patches of grass and dirt with small houses irregularly dotted about. What infrastructure there was boasted only volunteers, and I’d be surprised if there was more than five hundred people in total who called it home. The forest pressed in on all sides, like it did everywhere in the Pacific Northwest, I suppose, but it was an effect I was struggling to get used to. As I pulled up to Tommy’s house for the first time, it was… strange. I felt like even before I turned off the engine I didn’t belong there. Like I’d walked backstage at a theatre: nobody stopped me, but I couldn’t shake the impression that I’d gone somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be. Even when Tommy came out, and started to unpack the trunk, it seemed to me that he blended into the town in a way I just didn’t.

There was no sign this was anything other than in my own head, though. Tommy didn’t seem to notice anything off, and as I shifted my stuff into the tiny bedroom he wordlessly handed me a beer with a big smile. I drank it gladly, and tried my best to relax.

As it turned out my situation wasn’t quite as dreadful as I thought. I discovered the next day that my work had actually paid me a small amount. It wasn’t clear whether it was meant to be salary or severance, and I couldn’t get through to anyone who might have been able to explain it, but it was enough to ease the relentless pressure, if only a little bit. I allowed myself a few days to rest and recover from the chaos that the last week had been. I suppose technically I could have moved out of Tommy’s place, but he seemed… genuinely happy to have me around, and I reckoned my efforts were better spent looking for a new job than a place to live.

I spent the next few days sleeping, drinking, and gently exploring the tiny town which now counted me among its residents. It was quiet, though by no means deserted; I regularly saw other people walking the streets, though there was no sidewalk to speak of. It may have just been my imagination, but whenever they saw me, it seemed like they paused for just a moment, staring at me, before they continued on their way. They seemed friendly enough apart from that, and there never seemed to be any subtext or hidden meaning behind their greetings. Thinking back now, though, I’m not sure I ever saw any children, though maybe I’m reading too much into it.

I found the… pit almost immediately. It wasn’t like it was something that could easily be missed, sitting there at the intersection of River Street and 6th, gaping up at the bright blue sky. It looked like a sinkhole, but almost completely circular, and instead of the sheer drop of most such holes, this one sloped gently down towards a small opening at the centre, maybe ten or fifteen feet below street level. In some ways it seemed more like a crater than a sinkhole, but it was so neat and regular, I didn’t think it could be the result of any impact or explosion. It was huge, bigger than the street that should have been there, and the thing that struck me as odd, was that the road continued around it. It seemed to split apart just before the pit, and come together on the other side of it. I mean, I don’t know if you can judge the age of a hole just by looking at it, but it didn’t seem that old. The road did, though, or at least it definitely hadn’t been put down recently. There was no indication it had been laid separately to the rest of the town. The pit was just there.

As I stood, staring at the hole in the ground, I heard a car coming up the road behind me. I stepped to the side as it drove past and around the edges of the pit, before continuing on. I glanced briefly inside the driver’s side window, but there was no surprise on her face, no irritation at the obstacle. It seemed to have barely registered. I left soon afterwards, weirdly unnerved by its… smooth, circular presence.

I asked Tommy about it the next day. He was reaching into the kitchen to grab me a beer, when I told him I’d stumbled across it when walking around town. I wondered, did he know anything about it? How long had it been there? Was it a sinkhole, or an earthquake, or… or what? It was only after I’d casually tossed out a whole series of questions that I noticed Tommy had frozen in place, one hand in the fridge and the other on the door. He didn’t seem alarmed or scared, just completely still. I was quiet for a few seconds, and then he took the beer out and handed it to me, shutting the little fridge behind him. He gave no indication that he’d heard me. So I asked again, the pit on 6th and River, what was it’s deal? He looked at me for a while, like he was trying to puzzle out what I had said from a different language, then shrugged, and mumbled something about old roads not being properly maintained. “No,” I said, “the pit. The big hole in the ground.” He just shook his head like I was talking nonsense, and headed off to his room. I tried to drink my beer, but it tasted thick and unpleasant on my tongue.

I wanted to forget it, to ignore the dusty crater that waited in the middle of this tiny town, but I couldn’t. Something about it rubbed at me, like a speck of dirt in my eye, but the more I tried to reach it, the deeper it went. I checked maps of the area, looking to see if any of them featured the odd landmark, but I found ones that went right up to 2008, and none of them had anything marked at that spot, even though the split in the road had clearly been there far longer than a year.

I tried to talk about it, see if anyone else had any idea about what the pit was or why it was there, but when I asked around Joe’s – the only diner in town – everyone reacted just like Tommy.

Mishearing, misunderstanding or just straight-up ignoring me. It wasn’t even like they seemed deliberately evasive; all their reactions seemed genuine, but no-one was able to talk about the pit. I’d just about given up on getting anything sensible out of the people at Joe’s that afternoon, when an older man walked over to me. I’d seen him around a bit, though I couldn’t have told you who he was or what he did. He was big, though, with a face that looked chiselled out of limestone. I stopped eating, and waited.

The old man stared at me for what must have been a good twenty seconds, and then he spoke. “Nothing for you down there,” he said. “You just go and enjoy your sky.” There was no mistaking the threat in his voice, as if I wasn’t going to have a lot of time left to do so, and I was about to say something when his head suddenly snapped forward, and he spat at my feet. Then he turned and walked away. I looked down, and saw a thick brown lump of mud. Nobody looked over, and I didn’t follow him.

I actually tried to take his advice. I had other things to be worried about, and fundamentally there was no reason for me to be so obsessed with a hole in the ground. It wasn’t even like I needed to travel that road. I was only regularly travelling to Olympia to apply for jobs, and from Tommy’s house the pit was in entirely the other direction. But I started to dream about it. Dream about walking into the pit, the ground turning to thick, sucking mud underneath me. I’d dream about it filling my mouth, my lungs. I couldn’t breathe.

There was one, I can’t honestly say if it was a dream, but I also can’t bring myself to call it a memory. It was sunny, the middle of the day. I could hear the sound of laughter from somewhere in town, soft voices chatting to each other. A peaceful day. I walked as far as the pit, and for the first time, I crossed the edge and began to climb down into it. It was dry, dusty, and the air felt different from the rest of the town. Slowly, carefully, I walked to the hole in the centre. This bit looked more like a sinkhole, disappearing down into the pitch darkness. It was less than a foot across, and I felt a gentle rush of cool, wet air. I sat there in silence, listening, convinced I could hear something, but there was only silence. I leaned closer, my head directly over the hole, and I heard it. And then I did what it told me to.

I took my hand, and I reached down into the darkness. Down and down, until my whole arm was inside, up to the shoulder. It was damp and cold, with the rough stone sides scraping my skin, but my hand was stretched as far as I could, and it still gripped nothing but empty air. Then the hole began to close, and all at once the spell was broken. I tried to pull my arm out, to get free, but it held me tight. Not quite crushing me, but holding me in place. I screamed and cried for help, looking around for anyone who might be able to hear me, but the only people walking by seemed utterly oblivious to what was happening. Then I felt it, something brushing against my hand from below it in the hole. Teeth. Wet, blunt teeth, which quickly gave way to a rough, slender tongue that wrapped itself around my hand and snaked up my arm, as though tasting me. Then, without warning I felt it snap back into the darkness, taking some of the skin with it, and my arm was abruptly released.

The next thing I remember I was lying in bed. I want to say I had just woken up and it was all a dream, but I was fully dressed, dusty, and with long, thin scratches that snaked around my arm.

That was when I started desperately looking for a way to leave Bucoda. I’d been there for just over a month by this point, and had managed to find a part-time job over in the nearby town, Chehalis. The pay wasn’t great, but it should have been just about enough to move out if I was careful. Tommy was upset, of course, but didn’t seem surprised – that month had been a bit tense, and we weren’t particularly well-suited to living together anyway. I suppose that’s what you get for moving in with strangers you meet in a bar.

It was the night before I left that it happened. 17th June, 2008. I’d got all my things boxed up and ready to go. I had the keys to my new place. All I had to do was get one more good night’s sleep. Instead I was woken up about two in the morning by the sound of the front door closing. I called out, but Tommy didn’t respond. I searched the house to make sure no-one had broken in, but the place was empty. I was alone. Tommy’s business was his own, I decided, and was about to return to bed when I saw a shadow pass by the window. Then another. I quietly moved to the door and pushed it open, looking out into the street to see if I could figure out what was going on.

There aren’t a lot of street lights in Bucoda, and at night, when all the houses are dark it can get very eerie indeed. I was close enough to see the figures moving down the road, though. They walked casually, like they were just going for a stroll, but there were a lot of them. Maybe the whole town. Walking out of their houses and trailers, and down the unlit streets. I knew exactly where they were going, and I just couldn’t stop myself following them.

I don’t know how the whole town was able to get inside the pit. There must have been hundreds of them, piled high, and encrusted with mud. They did not move, though their eyes shone so brightly in my torch that they must have been alive. None of them made a sound, though I could feel a warmth and shuddering below my feet, as though the earth itself was screaming.

Without warning one of their heads snapped towards me. It was a young woman who had lived the next road over, and whose name I had never learned. She stared at me, eyes suddenly alive with terror, and began to scream. The instant she did, she disappeared, pulled into the ground, cutting the sound off before it had even begun. I turned and ran, back to the house. I wanted to drive away, but I couldn’t bear to be outside. So I hid, under my bed the rest of the night, and felt the ground rock gently beneath me.

I don’t know if Tommy returned the next day. As soon as it was light outside, I leapt into my car, and began to drive away. I tried to, at least. I didn’t want to see the pit again, I really didn’t. But I did. It was empty, as before, like the previous night had never happened. But it was bigger. And the road had swelled to encompass it.

There was someone else looking at it, though. An elderly woman, face pinched and thoughtful, stood at the edge looking down. I didn’t recognise her, or the car she stood next to. She definitely wasn’t from Bucoda. Sat in the car next to her, I could see a young man who had clearly been crying. I couldn’t get over how blue his eyes were. The old woman caught my eye, and looked from me, to the pit, and back again. I thought about saying something when she gestured for me to leave, and I did. I decided that I was no part of whatever was happening, so I drove away, and didn’t look back.

That night, the earthquake struck that destroyed Bucoda entirely, so I guess I’ll never know what was going on. And honestly? I’m glad.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

Why has Elias sent me this statement? It took place the other side of the world, to people who don’t seem to have any connection with what’s going on. I’ve suspected for a while there may be some power concerned with caves and enclosed spaces, being buried alive or crushed. So I suppose it’s nice to get a statement that goes some way to developing that theory, but… I cannot figure out what it has to do with our current situation. Is it the nameless old man? The old woman? Or whoever was crying in the car? Is he trying to warn me not to ignore my own metaphorical pit, because if so, what is my metaphorical pit?

You know, it’s somehow worse, now that I know I can ask why he’s sending me these statements, but that he still won’t… tell me. I did my follow-up. Mr. Ellis is still alive and well, currently living in Tacoma, and unwilling to discuss these events any further. The town of Bucoda itself is… Well, it’s… gone. Newspapers reported it as an earthquake, and tremors were felt as far away as Castle Rock, but despite every article describing Bucoda as having been “destroyed” by the earthquake, there are no pictures or records of the destruction itself. No damage seems to have occurred outside of town limits, and all the roads in the area seem unaffected, despite there being no evidence of rebuilding works taking place after the event. As far as I can tell, there was an earthquake, and then Bucoda wasn’t there, but aside from these two detail –

Still doing those?

Yeah. Yeah.

I did ask Elias if I could stop.

And he said no for a mysterious reason?

I don’t know. I mean, he kind of explained. I think? John’s “too inconsistent” at the moment. He needs to make up for the shortfall. Which, I guess means me.

No.

Yeah, we talked. Not long, he – Y’know, I think he thinks that the distance keeps us safe, you know? Like, like, if he just makes sure that we’re not involved, we’re somehow fine.

He’s an idiot. Look, we didn’t know what that door was, and it still trapped us. Ignorance isn’t going to save anyone.

Martin Blackwood, Archival Assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording statement number 8640514. Statement of Doctor Algernon Moss, given May 14th 1864.

[CLEARS THROAT]
MARTIN (STATEMENT)
My story, such as it is, should not be long in the telling, though there is much you could understand of the circumstances surrounding it. I come to you not to wallow in my condition, or pour out my soul like a papist in the confessional, but to request your assistance. I believe that Maxwell Rayner has at his disposal some unholy power that he has used to curse me and cause my blindness. Or, more precisely, to cause me to blind myself, for I shall not deny I did so willingly. For obvious reasons my accusations have had me laughed out of most polite society. Not quite so polite when you’re accusing someone of witchcraft, it would seem. I now ask the assistance of your Institute in the hopes that you may be able to furnish some evidence or legal precedent that may assist me in taking action against my assailant, though I will admit my expectations for the latter are limited.

Maxwell Rayner is an oddity. He claims to be an antiquities dealer from Africa, and has, of late, become something of a darling in certain circles of Cambridge, though I have never heard him discuss either antiquities or his supposed homeland in any real detail. His passion appears to be polar expeditions, and it’s rare to attend any social gathering with him where the subject does not eventually come up. In particular he seems to share that peculiarly specific mania regarding the fate of John Franklin and his lost expedition. I would assume he was intending to accompany such a party himself, were it not for the fact of his own blindness. Indeed, the spectacle of his milky white eyes staring behind the weathered black skin of his face is an image so striking that, were I to be uncharitable, I might suggest it had something to do with the readiness with which he acquires invitations and calling cards. He is led around by a young Arabian lad of ten or eleven, though the ease with which he carries himself makes me suspect this assistance is an affectation rather than necessity. Both speak perfect English, with no accent I can recognise, though the boy rarely opens his mouth other than to alert Rayner of nearby goings-on.

The circumstances of our dispute are, by some margin, the least interesting part of my tale. I outbid him at an auction. It was nothing of note, so I assumed, though perhaps I should have considered his particular obsession. It was an oilskin packet of documents, supposedly from the log-books of Franklin’s lost ship, the HMS Terror. I will admit a small amount of interest in the matter myself, and my inclination turned to resolve when I saw how insistently Rayner was bidding on it, and I prevailed. He approached me afterwards to discuss the matter and, perhaps if his tone had been less sharp, I might have allowed him to observe the documents himself, but as it was I took some issue with his manner of address and curtly denied him. He was almost shaking with rage at this point, and I was momentarily concerned that the situation might descend into violence when, instead, he leaned forward and whispered with an intensity I had never before heard in a human voice: “Pray the Sandman only brings you sleep.”

Now, the fact that these words filled me with a stark terror that all but overcame my senses probably needs some explanation. My father was not a kindly man, you see. He came from a stern Christian tradition that would curdle the smiles of the simpering vicars you encounter these days. As a boy, I soon learned that the key to avoiding his ire was to avoid his attention altogether, and never more so than after I had been put to bed. The nursery, you see, had its door in the middle of the passage between the drawing room and my father’s study and, as such, he would pass by it several times a night. When I heard that heavy tread outside the door and the shadow passing over the threshold, I would lie there and pray that I was quiet enough not to disturb his passage. If I was ever foolish enough to leave my candle burning that I might read a few minutes more, I would hear the door open and my father’s voice intone, “Lights out.” He had been a military man in his youth, had my father, and he prided himself on handing down that discipline to me.

Eventually I was sent off to board at Repton School, up near Manchester. The Headmaster there, one John Heyrick Macaulay, was apparently an old friend of my father’s. It was a miserable place: over two centuries old and very much showing it. When I attended there must have been barely fifty boys there, and no cricket pitch, racquet court, or any of the sort of facilities one might have expected, nor even a chapel. The few masters there taught Latin and Greek readily enough, but no French or music or natural science. Were it not for the relative freedom we had to rove around the nearby land and towns, I would have had a solidly miserable time there. Even when we managed to play football, it was between crumbling arches, loomed over by the jagged shadows of broken pillars. For all the life and vitality of the boys there, the place itself was decrepit, and sometimes I feel it resented our presence.

I had one great friend during my time at Repton, a lad named George Denman. I’m sure you recognise the name, given the recent speeches he’s been giving on capital punishment. Well, I bet it never comes up in his Parliamentary goings-on that he has the word “Fly 1835” inscribed on his left arm with India ink. “Fly” was the nickname the hound master at Repton gave him, you see, on account of his propensity for running, and he insisted on getting hold of a needle and tattooing it upon himself. This may give you an idea of the impetuous soul that possessed Denman as a youth. He was always going out of bounds or running off after curfew, and if the masters caught him he’d be dragged back to bed. He slept in the bedroom adjoining my own, and whenever I heard the approaching footsteps of whichever master caught him, I would instinctively blow out my candle, the old dread of my father returning in a rush.

One day, Denman pulled me to one side, eyes alive with mischief, and told me that he had returned from his holidays in possession of a “positively ghoulish” book. It was a German tome titled Die Nachtstüke, and contained several morbid tales by a man named Hoffman. I spoke little German, but Denman had enough of a grasp for us to puzzle through the stories together. The candles would burn low as, sentence by sentence, we would decode that delightful unease that can be elicited by a properly macabre tale.

The first of the collection was titled Der Sandmann, and was what I believe would these days be referred to as a psychological story, dealing with the madness, trauma and hallucinations of the protagonist, including the eponymous Sandman. What stuck with me, however, was a description given of a particularly horrific interpretation of the Sandman. Far from the comforting friend of children he is so often portrayed as, he was rendered as quite the monster.

I remember how the old maid of the story describes him quite keenly, as well as I remember my own dread at the passage Denman translated:

“He comes to children who don’t go to bed, and throws his sand all into their eyes, and they start to bleed. He takes those fallen eyes up in his bag, and carries them up into the crescent moon, to his nest, where his own children feast upon them. They have crooked beaks like owls, all the better to pick the eyes of naughty human children.”

Dear lord, just remembering it, even now, blind as I am, it still makes me shake. You can imagine the effect it had on me as a lad. Denman read us through the rest of the stories, but I could barely pay attention, my mind fixated on that figure with its razor-sharp sand and long, hooked beak. Now, when I heard my masters walk past my room at night, I had no doubt as to the terrible shape they had taken. I had the most awful nightmares of the Sandman, stood in my doorway, motionless, intoning in the voice of my father: “Lights out”.

I had never told anyone of this childhood terror, not even my wife. So, you may imagine the shock and confusion when I heard the words spoken by Maxwell Rayner. He actually looked almost surprised at my expression when I pulled back from him, clearly sensing he had struck a nerve. Perhaps he didn’t know, and I was simply a victim of the most grotesque coincidence. Whatever the situation, I mumbled my excuses and fled. I swear I could still feel those unseeing eyes follow me as I left the room, a grin of victory playing upon his lips.

Perhaps you can guess what happened next. I don’t know how vivid or nightmarish the other accounts you collect here might be. Certainly nobody else believes me when I speak of it. But… the Sandman came for me that very night.

He was nothing like the story. He was tall, yes, and thin, but the edges of him were impossible to see against the darkness he was a part of. He had no beak, but coarse black sand trickled from his open mouth and hit the floor with a steady hiss. His legs were long, but he crossed the room slowly, every one of his joints moving and twisting as he took step after torturous step. There was no sound at all. I looked to my wife, but she was locked in a peaceful sleep.

A thin beam of moonlight was clearly marked upon the floor, where a gap in the curtains let it shine through. As the long dark foot touched it, I watched that moonlight curdle like rancid milk. Wherever the Sandman touched, the world dissolved into a choking darkness. First my door. Then creeping along the distance of our bedroom. Then the bed itself. Then my Agatha. Until all that was left was me, the darkness, and the dreadful thing that brought it.

I do not know how I had come to the conviction that I was in the Sandman’s sack. The idea simply arrived in my head fully formed. I had been taken, and would remain here, trapped forever in this lightless place, without even the faintest hint to taunt me. The darkness pressed in, and seemed to fill my mouth, my nose. But it did not touch my eyes. And then I made a choice. I still knew where the Sandman was, though I couldn’t tell you how, and I decided that sightlessness was preferable to darkness. If you had asked me before, I would have told you that there was no difference, but I know better now. There is far more to the darkness than simply being unable to see.

I reached out to where I knew the thing’s pouch would be, and seized a handful of sand. It was already slick with my blood as I lifted it and cast it into my face. I do not suppose I need to dwell upon the pain, but please know that I would sooner die than endure it again.

It worked, though. Inasmuch as I have remained solidly within this world. In some ways I left my sight behind in that awful place, but I am well rid of it, if it kept the rest of me here. I only wish the last thing I saw, the final vision burned into my mind, had been anything other than that awful, shifting face.

So, there is my story. I’m sure you’ll agree that Maxwell Rayner is the clear architect of my misfortune. Now, how do you suppose I revenge myself upon him?

MARTIN
[Panting] End of statement.

[Deep breath] I, um, I think I might need to sit down. Oh. Yeah, I am. Right. I don’t, uh, I’m not really sure if these are actually getting easier or harder. I mean I don’t feel –

Y-You know what, that’s not important. [Sigh] I wish John kept better organised notes because I know he’s mentioned someone called Maxwell Rayner, but I cannot find much in the way of any info –

MELANIE
Uh, Martin, have you seen Elias?

MARTIN
Oh, uh… No, but Tuesday lunch he normally meets with the Library staff, I think. He’ll… He’ll probably be back in his office in an hour or so?

MELANIE
Ah, thanks.

Er… Are you alright?

MARTIN
Hm? Oh, I, yeah, I’ve… ah. Yeah, I’m fine.

MELANIE
You just look really pale.

MARTIN
I… [Sigh] I was just recording one of the statements, and they are…

MELANIE
Ah, right! Yes.

They, um… they’re a lot, aren’t they?

MARTIN
Sorry?

MELANIE
I mean they… they really take it out of you. I must have slept, er, twenty hours after I did one.

MARTIN
Hang on. You recorded a statement?

MELANIE
Yes. It was about a bed, funnily enough.

MARTIN
I… I don’t suppose you’d mind doing some more?

Elias wants to make up the shortfall while John’s away and what with Tim…

MELANIE
Sure, no problem. Al-Although I was just going to have a talk with Elias, so, uh, maybe I can convince him to cut you some slack.

MARTIN
I wouldn’t hold my breath.

MELANIE
Right. Fair. Listen, you really look like you could use a drink. Um, me and Basira were just about to pop out. So… do you want to join us?

MARTIN
It’s like one in the afternoon.

MELANIE
Are you afraid of getting fired?

MARTIN
…

Huh. I’ll get my coat.

MELANIE
Great.

Just, um, gimme, gimme an hour or so. I, I just have a few things to take care of… first.

MELANIE
Knock, knock.

ELIAS
Ah, Melanie. Can I help you?

MELANIE
Oh, not really. I, I just went out for some coffees, and, and thought I’d get you one.

ELIAS
How very thoughtful.

MELANIE
I don’t know how you take it, but John likes his black, so… I, I thought that was a fair assumption.

ELIAS
It was. However, I think I’d rather you drink it.

MELANIE
Oh… er, what?

ELIAS
The coffee you brought me.

[SLIDES COFFEE ACROSS DESK]
Drink it.

MELANIE
N… N… No. Y-You’re okay. I’ve, I’ve got my own actually. It’s a… a decaf one… [Nervously chuckles]

ELIAS
I assume you don’t believe me, then? That murdering me would also kill you?

MELANIE
I-I-I don’t know what you’re…

ELIAS
Coffee is not as good for disguising tastes as you might think. And it’s even worse at disguising texture. Dissolved pills always leave such a, um, chalky residue.

MELANIE
Look, Elias, I never –

ELIAS
I assume this is your first time attempting to poison someone? Do you actually know how many painkillers it takes to kill someone, or were you just hoping I’d take enough to get sick, and you could finish the job… manually?

[A CLOCK TICKS]
MELANIE
[Deep breath] Why…? Why bother asking then? Why bother if you know everything?

ELIAS
[Chuckles slightly] I don’t know everything, Melanie. Do you know how exhausting that would be?

I’ll tell you one thing I don’t know, and that’s how to convince you that I’m trying to help. Honestly, you’re one of the lucky ones. But not if we’re all dead thanks to an… overzealous attempt at independence.

MELANIE
I don’t need you to –

ELIAS
Let’s have no more clumsy assassination attempts, alright? And we’ll say no more about it. Consider this your first warning. Next time I shall have to escalate matters, and that won’t be a pleasant process for anybody.

Understood?

GERTRUDE
Case 9522002 – Robert E. Geiger. Incident occurred in Boise City, Oklahoma, April 1935. Victim’s name given as Stefan Brotchen. Statement given 20th of February 1952. Committed to tape 2nd of September, 2007. Gertrude Robinson recording.

GERTRUDE (STATEMENT)
I read somewhere once I was the first man to use the term “Dust Bowl”. Now, that’s not so. Maybe the first the boys in the New York office had heard, but down in Oklahoma it wasn’t too unusual a turn of phrase. Wide, flat, open spaces… You could see a storm coming for miles, coming straight at you all across the horizon, looking near as anything like the end of the world.

Those were bad days. Worse than anyone knows. Did my best to spread the word, filed my copy with the AP, but there was plenty I never did find the words for. There were things in the dust that I never told to a soul. It’s why I decided to step in on you folks. I still wish there was a place like this back home, but the way things are going they’d be up in front of Congress, likely as not, so maybe it’s for the best.

You know much about dust pneumonia? Don’t know why you would do, really. There isn’t much of it about these days. Wasn’t back then, either, at least before the storms came. Then there was plenty. The name makes it sound more complicated than it is. You see, ‘dust pneumonia’ is just a medical way of saying your lungs are full of mud. Too much goes in, you see, and it clogs up all the bits of your chest that should clear them out. There’s fever, difficulty breathing, infection… The dust mixes with the moisture of your insides, and soon enough you’re drowning, your lungs packed solid with mud and mucus.

Awful thing to happen to anybody, but that’s what the dust storms were. Great chunks of earth torn up and hurled across the open plains, desperate to find some poor unsheltered throat and climb inside. They buried you alive, without even giving you the courtesy of getting you below the ground. And I saw so many choking farmers, their dirt-streaked faces seemed to blend together. Watching as their livelihoods evaporated with the rain. As their farms, their homes, their lives collapsed into dirt. It was all a long sepia blur: weather-beaten faces caked in that same patina of misery and grit. All except for Stefan.

Stefan Brotchen was, to all appearances, much the same as any other Okie farmer: strongly built, with a mess of short, curly, blond hair and a round, smiling face. But his eyes were different. There was… something there. I-I was never quite sure what, but they had a depth, a quiet intensity to them that struck me the first time I saw him. I’d been gathering comments for an AP article on the latest dust storms to hit the area. There’d been a lot of interest nationally after one dust storm made it all the way to Washington, and my editor was keen to get some comment from the people worst hit. So, naturally, I ended up in Boise City.

There was always something odd about that town. Something about it at odds with the land it sat on. Challenged the wide stretches of nothing. I guess that’s not a surprise, looking back. I did some research on the place afterwards, you see. Did you know that Boise City was founded by fraud? I mean literal, send-you-to-prison fraud. Yeah, back in 1908, three men decided to start selling the deeds to land they didn’t own. They printed up hundreds of brochures: “Come to scenic Boise City! Tree-lined boulevards, all the amenities, even a railroad station, all ready and waiting for brave souls to head out there and settle.” And people bought it. Almost three thousand of them. Of course, when they finally arrived to this fabled town, there was absolutely nothing there at all. Just empty, waiting earth. They didn’t even own the plots of land they’d been sold. But they stayed, and they built a town. Not a great town, by any stretch. Not even a good town, truth be told, but there it was, in defiance of all good sense.

One of the men who settled in the newly formed Boise City was Stefan Brotchen’s father. He was long-dead by the time we met his son. My photographer, a small man named Harry Eisenhard, had been told about the Brotchen farm when asking about places around the area hit bad by the storms. Stefan’s fields had nothing left but dry earth, they told us. Farmhouse stripped almost bare by the harsh winds, his livestock dead and already half-buried, his family gone. Never found out more than that. Just… gone.

When we pulled up that Sunday, the place was everything we’d been told and more. We’d see the top of wheels and farm equipment poking up through the ground, until we realised it wasn’t the ground, just a good three feet of newly fallen dirt half-burying the ploughs and wagon. I saw what must once have been a cow, covered from the neck up in coarse and clinging dust. Harry and I had wrapped our handkerchiefs over our faces, as the men back in town had told us, but the air was already thick, and I could hear Harry coughing beside me. I’d seen a few victims of the dust pneumonia by this point, and the sound of his breathing made me press the cloth close to my face, and offer up a silent prayer.

Stefan did not wear a cloth across his face when he came out to meet us, and I could see the fine particles collecting in his hair, in the corners of his eyes. He smiled warmly, and waved us over. I’ve tried in the years since to remember if there was anything behind that smile, anything dark or secret that I might have overlooked; there was nothing. The soft, friendly voice was, as far as I can tell, genuine, and as Stefan Brotchen sat there in his small, dusty kitchen, telling us his misfortunes, there was no clue in his face as to what must have been going on inside him.

His story was not unusual, and I’m sure that if you hunted down a copy of the Lubbock Evening Journal from that week there’d be most of it in there. Crops dying, soil parched and a farm on the brink of ruin, all ruled over by that desperate, empty hope of rain. He never mentioned his family, and I never thought to ask, though the house clearly was far too big for Stefan to live there alone. He offered us a drink at one point, just water, but I couldn’t bring myself to accept. I just had this image playing through my mind over and over again. He stands up, walks over, pulls out a bottle of thick, flowing mud, opens it, and pours it down his throat with a smile on his face. Just my imagination, I told myself. Just letting the dust get to me.

It only took an hour or two before I decided I had enough material for the story, and I stood up, and thanked him for his time. Harry did the same, and I shook Stefan by the hand. As I touched his skin, I almost pulled my hand away, it was so hot. It was a dry, feverish heat and I looked at his face and saw for the first time the fierce, flushed redness, the forehead slick with sweat. His chest started to convulse, and he doubled over, spluttering out a clod of pulpy, brown sludge onto the wooden floor. I started to ask if he was okay, but Harry tugged on my arm, gesturing outside with an almost wild urgency. It all seemed to be happening so fast I could barely register what was going on. At least, until I got outside and looked west.

The vast, roling black clouds stretched before us, as far as we could see. It was coming for us with such a speed that there was a part of me that immediately knew, despite all logic, that it was trying to kill me, and me alone. It was the worst dust storm I had ever seen, and it promised to blot out everything. I ran back inside to warn Stefan, and ask if he had anywhere we could wait it out, but I found him lying on the ground. He was face down, a thin trickle of dirt oozing slowly from his mouth and nose. I called to Harry, told him Stefan needed help, but he could barely hear me over the wind, which was now so fierce that it seemed to drown everything else out. When I finally made him understand, he seemed none too keen to drive through the storm, and warned me the engine would clog before we got half way back to Boise City. I said we had no choice but to try. If we didn’t, then Stefan was already dead.

We covered his face with a cloth, and carried him out and into our small car, laying him into the back as gently as we could. The wind was so sharp it felt like it was trying to strip the flesh from my skull; I had to hold my hand in front of my eyes to keep out the dirt that was whipping around at forty miles an hour. Even with my handkerchief covering my mouth, I could feel the dust creeping in, forming a damp, cloying paste between my teeth. And the storm hadn’t even hit yet.

I climbed into the driver’s seat, while Harry scuttled round to the passenger side, and with Stefan laid across the back we turned and began the drive back towards town, trying to convince ourselves we had any hope of outrunning the storm.

We did not.

It bore down on us like the judgement from Heaven, and in less than a moment the sun was gone and the sky was black. I tried to keep driving, but I could hear the engine choking, sputtering, and finally coming to an end.

It’s hard to describe just how dark it is in the middle of a dust storm. It’s not just the lack of sun but that no light can penetrate more than a few feet, before the swirling opaque cloud kills it dead. It’s loud, with the wind and the sound of those dry specks of earth blasting against the car, but it’s the sort of loud that, after a while, starts to feel a lot like silence. We did our best to plug up any gaps in the windows or the frame, and keep as much of the dust outside as we could, and then we sat there, feeling for all the world like we were the last people left alive, entombed within our metal coffin.

I tried to say something to Harry, to reassure him, but opening my mouth just invited more dust, and I was already coughing more than enough to panic. So we just sat there, in what felt like silence for over an hour, trying not to think about the storm, or the poor Oklahoma farmer dying on our back seat. We just waited.

At some point Stefan must have finally died. I know this because when he started talking to us again, there was no way he could have made those noises unless his lungs and throat were fully packed with sediment. The words were soft, insistent and spasmed out of his dirt-clogged body like an earthquake. I don’t remember what he said, not really. It only comes back to me in those quicksand dreams, where I feel the earth swallowing me forever. He was making promises, I think. Promising us that when the sky fell and became an eternity of mud, he would carve out a place for us in the heart of the forever buried. He would show us… the love of ‘Choke’.

I still couldn’t see anything, but I felt his hand on my face, hot and dry and rough, and I tried to scream, but it just let in more dust. Harry did scream, though, and I could hear a struggle going on beside me, grunts and the sounds of flesh striking soil, then the sound of a car door opening, and the sudden rush of wind and grit. And then it closed abruptly, and I once again sat in the unmoving quiet of the car. Except this time, I was alone.

I never saw Harry Eisenhard again. When the storm finally passed, I spent hours searching for him, but he was gone. I did find the body of Stefan, though, about twenty yards away, so encrusted with dirt he barely looked human anymore. Black Sunday, they called that storm, and Harry was a long way from its only casualty. He got lost in the shuffle, officially mourned by the staff of the Associated Press, and then never discussed again. I wish I could say more about him, but honestly, I hadn’t worked with the man very much. All I know is that he was taken by Stefan Brotchen, and that it happened after Brotchen was dead. When all that made him human was suffocated, and the only thing left to move and speak inside him was that terrible killing dust.

GERTRUDE
[Sighs] Hmm. Final comments.

Based on the history of Boise City and its deceptive roots, I would perhaps have expected some aspect of the Spiral to be at work here, but its unique position at the centre of the Dust Bowl does seem heavily to indicate another power overtly at work. I have had my suspicions about where to be focusing my efforts, and the nature of the pseudo-prophecies given by the dust inside Stefan Brotchen seems to confirm them. To that end, I’ve been examining fault lines and seismic data for –

[Adopts a somewhat frailer voice] Hello?

MICHAEL
Ah, Miss Robinson, I, um, I found Mr. Vargas’ statement that you asked for. Well, uh, I found the translation. I, I already had the original but, y’know, I, I, I didn’t think you’d want it in Spanish. [Nervous chuckles] U-u-unless you speak Spanish?

GERTRUDE
[Somewhat sharply] I do not. And thank you Michael.

MICHAEL
Sure. Um, well, was, was there anything else you needed?

GERTRUDE
Um… No, no. Not at the moment.

Thank you.

MICHAEL
Right, well, if you need me, uh, they’re installing that climate-controlled storage… that thing o-o-over the weekend, so I’m, I’m, y’know, I’m just getting all that together.

GERTRUDE
Yes! Yes, I remember.

MICHAEL
Right.

Well, call me if you need anything.

GERTRUDE
Thank you, Michael, I will.

[DOOR CLOSES]
[Normal voiced] Right. These additional researches have further cemented my belief that North America is going to be the focal point for the Buried. Now it’s just a matter of narrowing down the specifics of geography, and that may just come down to monitoring the right movement of supplies and people. I’m still not completely sold on the US for the Hunt, but that’s unlikely to be quite as urgent.

For the Buried, however, I do have what I believe might be quite an effective plan forming. Assuming, of course, that my suspicions about Jan Kilbride are correct, and that’s something that should be easy enough to determine once he’s back on Earth. Considering what’s probably happened to him up there already, I feel almost… bad, but there’s ten years yet before I can afford a conscience.

Gertrude knew Michael. He was one of her assistants, but, but, but that doesn’t make any sense. The thing that calls itself Michael, it – it – it doesn’t seem like it was ever human. So what happened to the real Michael? Did –

I mean that’s not really a question, is it? He’s dead, and it’s probably because of Gertrude. I still can’t figure out whose side she was actually on. Or even if she was playing the same game.

Doesn’t matter. Everyone who came close to her… seems like it… it went badly. Her assistants, Gerard, Leitner, Elias, though I don’t think Gertrude had anything to do with his going rotten. But Michael… Did it take that form just to mock me? Knowing that at – at some point I’d look deeper into Gertrude? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. This, this is my point!

GEORGIE
I said I’m fine with it. At least until you’re properly back on your feet. You’re not doing well. You keep apologising and saying you’re changing, but it’s all just the same. If you leave, I think it’s just going to get worse, and I don’t want that.

GEORGIE
Don’t! Okay. I’m well aware of my situation. It does not make me an idiot. And it doesn’t mean I got a death wish, either.

ARCHIVIST
Is it… Why are you so insistent on keeping me around?

GEORGIE
Because you’re trying to cut yourself off, and that’s… that’s really bad. Look, when’s the last time you spoke to someone who wasn’t me?

ARCHIVIST
That’s… I… I – I – talked to Martin a… a, a few weeks ago…

Did you talk to him? Or did he talk to you, while you tried to find a way to escape?

Look, you’re worried. I get it. But if you really think you’re turning into something… inhuman, you need people around you. You need anchors.

Well, you still need them.

ARCHIVIST
[Sigh] Maybe you’re right. I’ll talk to the others. Check in properly, see if I can help with the, uh, with Elias’ new management style. But I won’t stay here. If something happened to you, or, or, god-forbid, the Admiral, because I was here –

Yeah. The story is: I saw a ghost.

MARTIN
Okay. But what, what was it like? How did it make you, er, feel?

LYNNE
Erm… it was… scary and it made me feel… scared.

I’m sorry. Am I doing this wrong?

MARTIN
Ah… no, no, no, it’s okay. Erm… Let’s, let’s try this again. Try this again…

When did you first see this ghost?

LYNNE
Oh… god. Erm… about a year ago.

MARTIN
Anything more specific than that?

LYNNE
Er, I mean it’s been a while. I can’t really remember –

MARTIN
Er… okay, okay. Er, where? Where, where did you see the ghost?

LYNNE
Uh, my old flat.

MARTIN
Okay, okay, great. Which … where’s that?

LYNNE

LYNNE
Well, I was asleep.

MARTIN

You –

LYNNE
Well, I mean –

MARTIN
…saw a ghost when you were asleep?

LYNNE
No, no, obviously I woke up.

MARTIN
Right, right.

LYNNE
And… ghost.

MARTIN
Right. Erm…

LYNNE
Well, first it was, like… a burning smell.

MARTIN
Oh! Okay, okay. So… Did this happen a lot?

LYNNE
Yeah, yeah. A few nights.

MARTIN
Okay, right, so, like you’re, you’d wake up in the night, and you’d smell burning, and… what did you do?

LYNNE
Well… I first checked that my house wasn’t on fire.

MARTIN
Yeah… And then?

LYNNE
Go back to sleep.

MARTIN
And when it happened again, you would…?

LYNNE
Well, after a few times I realised, my house wasn’t on fire, so I’d just go straight back to sleep.

MARTIN
O-kay.

What, what happened the first time you saw the ghost?

LYNNE
I mean… [sigh] she was there…

MARTIN
Oh, it’s a ‘she’. Okay, okay. So describe the ghost to me. It’s, it’s a woman? A girl? A…

LYNNE
Yeah, yeah. A young woman.

MARTIN
And, and what was she doing?

LYNNE
I mean, she was on fire.

MARTIN
…

O-kay.

Erm, so, so she’s on fire. So what did you do? You’ve, you, you, you’re waking up in the night, and you’re seeing a… a woman is on fire in your flat, so you…?

LYNNE
I mean… what can you do? She wouldn’t be there for long.

MARTIN
Okay. Er… so, you didn’t call the police or…?

LYNNE
[Snorts] Well, no. I mean, it sounds a bit crazy, doesn’t it?

MARTIN
Okay, so…. So what is it that, sort of, made you… erm… [sighs]

– ‘coz we wanted to, have a, have a look around, ‘coz y’know –

TIM
What drove you to break into a Tube station, Mr. Smith?

‘SMITH’
Well… It’s… It’s part of, part of London’s history, y’know. It’s public transport, it’s interesting.

TIM
And you wanted to see the interesting things?

‘SMITH’
Yeah. I mean, y’know, there’s still trains running though at the platform level but there’s no… there’s no, the station isn’t running any more, it’s been abandoned. So much of the things there are all in original condition. Like they’ve still got the original adverts up and things like that.

TIM
Right… okay.

‘SMITH’
From when they shut it down. ‘coz they’ve never been removed.

TIM
But why specifically there Mr. ‘Smith’?

‘SMITH’
Oh, well, I mean, we had, we had some ideas about what, what might be down there. Y’know, it’s not, not just the, not just the, y’know, the public transport stuff and the adverts. We thought… might be something a little bit, a little bit more… I dunno, something, something worth investigating.

Um. We were down there, in the tunnels, and… and then the torches went out. And I think… [sniffs] I think they took him.

TIM
“They”?

‘SMITH’
Yeah, them. Them.

TIM
Okay. And who are they?

‘SMITH’
Well, I mean, you, you must know? I mean, like, this is the Magnus Institute. I mean, like, you know this stuff, right? You know, the people who are down in the tunnels, y’know…

TIM
What people are down in the tunnels, Mr. ‘Smith’?

‘SMITH’
The Government.

TIM
[Sighs] The Government?

‘SMITH’
Yeah, yeah, the Government.

TIM
Wonderful.

‘SMITH’
They’re down… they’ve got, they’ve got a holding facility down there. It’s a secret holding facility.

BASIRA
Right. Statement of… Robin Lennox?

ROBIN
Well… my friends call me Rob, well, some of, some of my friends call me Rob. Er… a lot of my friends, I guess some of them call me Robin. You can call me… er, if it makes it easier for you, then, yeah, that’s –

BASIRA
May 20th 2017. About a stone circle, I think. That’s what you said?

ROBIN
Erm, so it started, it started on, er, a day, when me and, er, me and Jackie, we were walking – Jackie’s my dog.

BASIRA
Okay –

ROBIN
We were, we were walking down the South Downs, which is what we normally do, er, before we go visit my mother for a, for a roast. Um. We were walking down and, er –

Are you much of a dog person?

BASIRA
What day was it?

ROBIN
Um, so, this… when would this have been, now? Now, this was about, about two weeks ago, so what would, would, where are we now? Um, that would put it at, maybe, maybe the 6th, I think.

BASIRA
Okay.

ROBIN
Perhaps… So, so, me and Jackie were walking down, down our usual trail, down the South Downs, and, er, in Lewes, er, which, er, like I said, is where my mother lives. Um, so were walking, walking along just – er, Jackie just loves to run off the lash and just run, scour around the fields and –

BASIRA
Okay. So you were walking, a couple of weeks ago –

ROBIN
Er, that’s right, yes.

BASIRA
– it was about noon –

ROBIN
In the South Downs, yes.

BASIRA
– yes, in the South Downs.

ROBIN
And… off in the distance, something just caught my, something just caught my eye, and I, I have pretty good eyesight. I, er, I had them… had, had an eye test a few days ago –

BASIRA
Yes.

ROBIN
Y’know, one of those free ones that you get, you go along just for the sake of it –

BASIRA
What… What did you see?

ROBIN
Okay, right, so, I, I thought to myself that, that stone circle, that wasn’t there before. At least, I thought it was a cir- a stone circle. So, so, me and Jackie went off to investigate – Jackie’s quite a curious dog. Um, it’s quite a normal thing for Jack, er, Jack Russell terriers to be curious animals –

BASIRA
So you went to investigate that?

ROBIN
Right, yes. So, so, we, we were, we were walking towards this, er, this, what I thought was a stone circle. So, I was, sort of, walking towards it, and I, I really noticed it got, it got quite a lot chillier. So it was quite a sunny day –

BASIRA
Okay.

ROBIN
– erm, I hadn’t, I hadn’t taken a jacket. Y’know when you sort of look out the window and you’re like ‘Today’s a jacket day’ –

BASIRA
[Desperately trying to get him on track] So you thought… you saw this stone circle?

ROBIN
Oh yes, yeah.

BASIRA
Started walking towards it?

ROBIN
That’s right.

BASIRA
And then…?

ROBIN
Okay, so, so, yeah, it’s like I said, it was definitely, definitely a bit, definitely a bit chillier. Um, I don’t think there was any wind or anything that day, but it, yeah, just sort of, as I was walking towards it, felt, felt the chill. And I felt Jackie, sort of, start to walk closer to me. She started to run off a lot less, as if she sort of – I don’t know, maybe I just sort of noticed th- y’know when you sort of get a feeling for what mood a dog’s in, um, when you sort of spend a lot of time around them –

BASIRA
So, what about this stone circle?

ROBIN
Oh, the stone circle. So, so, I got closer, and I realised that, although I hadn’t seen, I hadn’t seen the stone circle before, but the, the, sort of texture of the rocks and, maybe a bit of, er, I dunno, they looked quite old. They, they definitely looked like they had been there for a long time, but that they, but I recall them definitely not being there, ‘cause, ‘cause, I’ve taken that route maybe five or six or… [mumbles] a few times now. When was the first time I took that route? I think that was with –

BASIRA
So you don’t remember seeing this before, but the rocks looked old?

ROBIN
Let me start again.

MELANIE
Alright then. Statement of… Brian… er… ‘Fentinson’?

BRIAN1
Oh, um, it’s, it’s, it’s… it’s Fin-Finlinson.

MELANIE
Ah, right, sorry. That’s the… the handwriting here.

So. Statement regarding…

BRIAN
Sp-Spiders. B-B-But, I mean, lot, a lot of spiders!

MELANIE
Ah. Good. A spider one.

BRIAN
What?

MELANIE
Date: May 26th. And, er, go on… ah, let’s, let’s get this over with.

BRIAN
[Confused] Is… Look, is everything okay?

MELANIE
[Sighs] Yes. Yes, it’s, it’s fine. Sorry, I just, I just don’t hold out a lot of hope for… coherence.

BRIAN
What?

MELANIE
Our Archivist is on leave.

BRIAN
I don’t really. Look. I don’t really like staying in one place too long.

MELANIE
Fine. Statement begins.

BRIAN
Oh, um, I…

MELANIE
That means get started.

BRIAN
Oh, um, so… The spiders, they’re just, they’re all over my flat. Hundreds of spiders, and it’s freaky, like they just don’t act like spiders. And they’re leaving, like, web all over, all over my stuff, like on the sofa, and on like, on like, the microwave. Like, that’s weird, right? It’s not how spiders normally are.

MELANIE
[Interjecting] So… let’s, let’s, let’s, er, take this from a bit earlier. When did this start? When was the first “weird” spider?

BRIAN
A couple months? Nah, maybe a bit longer. Like, it, it started gradually, I guess. Like, y’know, I don’t like spiders, and sometimes, sure, there’s one in the bathroom, a little web or something, but that’s normal. And I just, y’know, asked a friend to deal with it or something. And, and then… Suddenly there were more spiders! Like the corner of every room. And it’s freaky ‘cause there’s, like, different types of spider. And different…

MELANIE 2
Right.

BRIAN
And they don’t normally, like, gather in groups of different species. It’s different species of spider, isn’t it?

MELANIE
[Stuttering somewhat] I-I-I-I’m not familiar…

BRIAN
I feel like they’re watching me!

MELANIE
What do you mean? Are they looking… at you?

BRIAN
They, they, they sort of move when I move. And, like, when I, when I go into a different room, I feel like there’s a, there’s a flow of spiders to the same room, or – But they don’t let me touch them, or, or, if I try and whack ‘em with a newspaper, they don’t let me get near!

MELANIE
Right.

BRIAN
And then… and the weirdest thing was when I asked an exterminator to come and look at the problem. They all disappeared! It’s like the first time I’d been, there’d been no spiders in weeks. And then suddenly, as soon as he leaves, they all come back! It’s like suddenly they’re there again!

MELANIE
[Trying to interrupt] Was… was… was that maybe the first time there had been another… person… looking at, at your flat?

BRIAN
Um. Well, I mean, I guess so? But no, ‘cause like –

MELANIE
Trying to pick this apart…

BRIAN
– I haven’t, haven’t invited someone to come over ‘cause there’s spiders and webs everywhere. But like – but there’s – I mean –

MELANIE
And the webbing…?

BRIAN
– Just think it’s the other day, they webbed, they webbed my bedroom door shut. I mean, that’s weird, right? Like, enough spiders leave enough web to seal the door. And they trapped me in there with the, all those spiders. That’s not normal, right?! That’s freaky! That’s supernatural!

MELANIE
But –

BRIAN
That’s what you guys do, isn’t it?

MELANIE
It does sound unusual…

BRIAN
Like, the supernatural, right?

MELANIE
Um… I mean, we’re, we’re an investigative… unit, but we’re…

BRIAN
I just wanted some help! Like, I heard you guys like… I thought if you know about the supernatural, maybe you could help me deal with this!

MELANIE
I… really wish that was the case.

BRIAN

LYNNE
Yeah, and then… she… er, reached out to me.

MARTIN
Oh, okay. Okay, right, so she reached out, um, and then… what, what happened? She reached out to you, so what did you do?

LYNNE
Er… Well, not a lot.

MARTIN
Right.

Um, and, and then she just… disappeared like normal?

LYNNE
I mean… she burned me a bit.

MARTIN
Oh! Oh wow! Okay, er, like, are you okay? Did you –

LYNNE
Oh.

MARTIN
Was there, was there a lot of damage? Are you – Is there…?

LYNNE
No, no, no. It’s… er, just, just a few hairs. My right arm. I mean they, they’ve grown back.

MARTIN
Like, like a few hairs? So then…

And then she disappeared and you…?

LYNNE
I went back to sleep.

[MARTIN GATHERS HIMSELF WITH A LONG INTAKE OF BREATH]
MARTIN
Right. Erm…

And, well, then what happened? So, y’know, y’know, you’ve been burned by this, mys-mysterious ghost, so what did you do?

LYNNE
I mean, I moved out.

MARTIN
And nothing… nothing since then?

LYNNE
Well, no. I’ve, I’ve moved.

MARTIN
Right.

Erm, I’m – I don’t suppose you’ve looked into the, the history of the building, or anything?

LYNNE
Why?

MARTIN
O-kay. Erm… Statement ends. I guess. Er… okay, yeah, great, um.

LYNNE
Cool.

MARTIN
Thanks so much for coming. Really appreciate it.

Erm, yeah, if you… yeah, if you head out, um, by the way that you came in, there’s a woman at the front desk, she’ll take your details down…

LYNNE
Great.

MARTIN
…and then we might, y’know, might be in contact about it in the future if we, if we do any follow up, and need, need to talk to you about any specifics again, but… that probably won’t…

LYNNE
Oh. You, you got everything then, yeah? That’s…

MARTIN
Erm… Yeah. Yeah. Y’know what, yeah. I think, I think that’s basically it, y’know. Th-Thanks so much for coming in, though. We do appreciate it.

LYNNE
Cool.

I know. Cool.

…

Er…

MARTIN
S-Sorry, is there, there is something else that, um…?

LYNNE
No, I just, just thought that maybe you would…

MARTIN
Er…

LYNNE
I mean, do I get… a… piece of paper or something?

To…

MARTIN
No, no, it’s fine. It’s, it’s, it’s fine.

LYNNE
…say that I’ve done it?

MARTIN
We, we, we keep an internal record.

LYNNE
I mean, do I… Is there, like… an invoice or something? I…

MARTIN
[Confused] In…? An… invoice?

For…?

LYNNE
I mean, just, just, my friend Gav said that, y’know, you guys… you need stories, and you need people to come forward, so…

MARTIN
Yeah, yeah…

LYNNE
And you… kind of…

You pay up people for their ghost stories, so…

MARTIN
Oh! Er, ah… [Nervous chuckle] I, I think there might be a bit of a, er, er, mis-miscommunication here –

LYNNE
Oh!

Oh, right, okay.

MARTIN
Yeah. Yeah… We don’t actually, um… er, we don’t pay for, pay for statements.

LYNNE
Right.

MARTIN
This is, this is more, a, er, documenting process than… er, we don’t use these for, um, for stuff outside of –

LYNNE
Okay.

MARTIN
– r-r-records.

Ahh. I’m really sorry. Er…

LYNNE
Oh. I mean, I mean, that’s why I –

Er, no, y’know, okay, but that’s fine.

TIM
I think you might possibly be looking for a different agency…

‘SMITH’
Well, I, I think so! I came here, because I have uncovered, like, a massive government conspiracy, yeah. And what are you doing? You’re like… you’re what? Just frowning at me sceptically.

ROBIN
Yeah, people have always said to me that Jack Russells can be difficult dogs, but I’ve always found that, that, as long as you, sort of, treat them right, and, you know, give them lots of treats, and it’s, it’s really quite –

BASIRA
[Getting exasperated] So you were in the spiral, and you heard an old man crying?

ROBIN
As I was meandering around, and you know when you hear, you, you hear someone crying, but you, you, but you definitely sort of say that’s, that’s… that’s, there’s an age in that voice. Like it sounded… like, if you, have you heard many old men crying?

BASIRA
[Sharply interjects] So you were following…?

ROBIN
Yes, that’s right. So, you know how, sort of, at places like Hampton Court, where they’ve got those little hedge mazes, and rather than, sort of, bounding straight into the middle of them, where you can just sort of walk over all the hedges, you have to, you have to, sort of, follow it through, er, I’ve, it sort of put in me in mind of that. As, er, as I sort of imagine myself in… exploring that maze –

BASIRA
So you followed the maze?

ROBIN
So I followed the, so I, yeah, so I followed the spiral, the spiral round and, er, I could definitely hear this sort of old man crying. And it d-d– It was definitely an old man, ‘cause it really reminded me of, er, this old chap I met once on a train, er, going, going to Liverpool. Er, he was, he was –

BASIRA
Mmmm, so… So what happened?

ROBIN
So, so… as I was going round, and, and hearing this old man, erm, I suddenly, suddenly realised that I was going to be late for… I was going to be late for my mum’s dinner that she had planned, er –

BASIRA
You… But… didn’t you say it was, it was about noon?

ROBIN
Well, that was the funny thing. So, you see, I, I looked at my watch, and I realised that six hours had gone by.

BASIRA
Six… Six hours?!

ROBIN
Yes, that’s right. So, er, at that point, I, I left.

BASIRA
…

I’m sorry?

ROBIN
Yes, so I would, I would have been late for dinner, so…

BASIRA
So you left?

ROBIN
So I got out of the spiral, and went to dinner.

BASIRA

[Highly anguished] …and I just, I dunno what to do anymore! I think they were following me. I think they followed me here! I saw a spider in the basement outside. And, and the webbing, it just… it had this webbing, the sticky kind… and I just… I don’t know how I can keep… I just need… This is the first time I’ve been in a room where I haven’t seen a spider –

There’s, there’s tea there.

Okay. Right. Yes.

Okay, breathe.

Yeah… well…

Drink, drink the tea.

It’s really not safe.

Sorry. B-Brian. B-Brian Finlinson.

Now. Am I to understand you don’t work here?

BRIAN
No… I was just, um… making a statement, or, or whatever. Um…

PETER
That’s probably for the best. Elias can be quite… ‘protective’ of his people. Never really understood why. I mean, in the end, the only person that you really have is yourself.

Wouldn’t you agree, Brian?

BRIAN
[Thoroughly confused] I don’t… What?

PETER
Well. Plenty of time to make your mind up, I’m, I’m sure.

Now… If you’ll excuse me, like I said, I have an appointment to get to. You are sure you don’t know where Elias Bouchard’s office is?

No.

Oh… Oh… Oh, Archivist. What have you done now? It’s almost sad to see you like this.

Almost.

I’ve come to a decision, Archivist. I’m going to kill you.

ARCHIVIST
[FRUSTRATED GROAN]
MICHAEL
It’s earlier than I had hoped, but that’s life… I suppose. Your life. [Giggles] Before I do, however, I want you to understand… even if it does go against my nature. So.

[THE GAG IS REMOVED; THE ARCHIVIST GASPS]
[Enunciating each word carefully] Ask your questions.

ARCHIVIST
What?

MICHAEL
Ask me.

ARCHIVIST
H-How did you find me?

MICHAEL
[Giggles] The Eye watches, and the Stranger conceals, but me… I lie, Archivist. I am the throat of delusion incarnate. They can’t hide you from me.

[GASPS AS THE ARCHIVIST CONTINUES TO RECOVER]

What do you have to do with the Unknowing?

MICHAEL
Nothing. [Giggles] Nothing whatsoever. Except perhaps that I would like it to fail.

ARCHIVIST
So… wh-why are you here?

MICHAEL
I already said. To kill you.

ARCHIVIST
But – but why?

MICHAEL
Because I don’t want the Circus to win. And I don’t want the Archives to, either. Killing you myself… it’s the best of both. And, of course, there’s revenge.

ARCHIVIST
Revenge? I still don’t even know who you are!

MICHAEL
I am Michael. I was not always Michael. I do not want to be Michael. Being Michael stole the only purpose I have ever known.

ARCHIVIST
You were Gertrude’s assistant, weren’t you?

MICHAEL
No.

ARCHIVIST
But, but the tape – I heard you.

MICHAEL
[Slowly] No. You heard Michael.

[FRUSTRATED SOUNDS FROM THE ARCHIVIST]

I… What the hell are you talking about?!

MICHAEL
Quiet, Archivist. The cramped casket sings loud, but not loud enough to drown out screaming. The Michael on that tape was not me. When that person was Michael, I was something else, and now I am Michael, and that person is gone.

ARCHIVIST
So, what… You… you became him?

MICHAEL
No more than he became me. It is rare that someone I take finds their way into being me, but it does happen. And Michael had help.

ARCHIVIST
What happened?

MICHAEL
Hm…

Ahhh, a statement. Of course. Is your recorder running?

Yes. Say it, Archivist.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of… Michael. Taken from subject. Date…

MICHAEL
The last day of the Archivist’s life.

ARCHIVIST
Statement begins.

MICHAEL (STATEMENT)
How far back should it go? To the beginning of me? Centuries? Millennia? How do you define the start of your being when in some ways you have always been? Time is difficult to form. Michael Shelley, though, he is easier to keep track of. He was born. He was pointless. And he should have died. But before that could happen, he went to work for the Magnus Institute – that ivory tower, keeping its prisoners ignorant in pursuit of… knowledge. [Giggles] A dungeon full of idiot watchers. And Michael Shelley was no exception.

When he was in school, he lost a friend to something like me. His friend was named Ryan, but those in power simply called him schizophrenic. I don’t know if he was, but it doesn’t matter. He was so dreadfully afraid his world wasn’t real that to make it so was almost nothing. Michael was there when he was taken; he never got over what he saw. Or didn’t see. After much searching and despair, it drove him into the waiting arms of the Institute, where he met Gertrude Robinson. The Archivist.

Even being what I am, I have rarely seen anyone so adept at distorting the truth as Gertrude Robinson. Michael was protective of the frail old woman he believed her to be. So… so delicate, so forgetful, yet gently wise. He cared for her. He trusted her. And she fed him to me. She made him me to destroy our transcendence. And she did not hesitate.

Poor Michael. He had been on trips for the Institute before. Conferences, investigations, Gertrude had made sure that all her assistants were ready. That none of them would be suspicious if they were told they were going abroad for work. So there was no doubt in his mind, no concern, when she told him that they were travelling to Russia. Perhaps if he’d have stopped to look up their destination, he might have discovered there was no such place as Zemlya Sannikova, but he did not. He trusted her.

Even when they arrived in Dikson, at the edge of the Kara Sea, and they were picked up by a quiet sea captain called Peter Lukas… Even then he trusted her. They travelled north, through cold far more bitter than any Michael had even conceived possible. And do you know what he worried about? [Giggles] He… worried about Gertrude Robinson. About how this poor old woman might cope with the chill. But now she was like iron, and walked with a purpose that Michael had never before seen in her. The water turned to ice as the Arctic approached, and Gertrude’s eyes turned cold.

Then, at last, he began to be afraid. He asked her where they were going and was told again: Zemlya Sannikova. Sannikov Land. There was a great evil, she said, and Michael was going to help her fight it. Am I evil, Archivist? Is a thing evil when it simply obeys its own nature? When it embodies its nature? When that nature is created by those which revile it? Perhaps Gertrude believed so. Michael certainly did. He believed everything she told him.

And it was me they sought to stop. Me and the others of It-Is-Not-What-It-Is. Our Great Twisting. The-Worker-of-Clay had laboured for decades on that contorted, impossible edifice of doors… and stairs… and falsehoods… and smiles. A thousand staring morsels stood, and not one of them believed themselves sane to look upon it. And in the centre, the door that would open to all the places that were never there, was me. I use the word ‘apotheosis’ not because it is correct, but because I can only show you its truth when we are within the passages themselves.

And this is what Michael and Gertrude found when they set foot on Sannikov Land, which does not exist and never has. It was warm, and feeling its reassurance beneath his feet was the last time poor, doomed Michael knew comfort. They walked through the green jungle of that forever-elusive polar island, and up the gentle mountains that can never have a name. And at the top, they found us through our spiralling laughter. And they saw us in all of our glory.

Michael did not go mad, though no words you could have said would have convinced him otherwise. The mind does not shatter, Archivist. It is soft and malleable. It bends and twists and returns to what it was, though what you see and feel may leave their mark upon it. If Michael thought he had lost his mind, it was only because what he saw with crystal clarity was simply not something that could be real.

But Gertrude Robinson did not waver. She did not… hesitate. She gave no indication that she saw anything more or less than was expected. Hers was not a mind that left room for doubt. She stared into us carefully, her eyes scanning for something that was my heart. Looking for my door. And she found it.

Perhaps I should have realised what was happening; seen those two lonely figures approaching me, but I cannot tell you the existential joys of truly… becoming. Of an entireness finally crossing the threshold into your self. So ecstatic was my completeness, I did not even hear my own door creak open. Because Gertrude had told Michael how he could stop us. She told him to walk through a door. And even then, with so much of his mind shut down in panic and terror, he trusted her. And he went inside, closing the door behind him.

But Gertrude Robinson had given poor, disposable Michael one more thing before sending him to me. She had given him a map. I couldn’t say how she would have gotten such a thing, or if she somehow made it. And yet it was a map. A map to me. It made no sense, lines overlapping and inverting, but once within, Michael knew which turns to make, which doors to open, which mirrors to shatter. Until he became me.

Even sharper than the joy of becoming is the agony of being opened and remade. To have your who torn bloody from your what, and another crudely lashed into its place. To become Michael. And to do so at such a crucial point in our Twisting, in our becoming, well of course it destroyed it. The impossible altar collapsed. The-Worker-of-Clay tore out his veins to dissolve himself in crimson mud. The others of us were cast to all the places that aren’t; some have still not found their way out again. And somehow, Gertrude Robinson was back on that boat before Sannikov Land once again never existed.

And all that was left was me. Michael. [Giggles] My very existence tied to my pointlessness. Wearing my failure as the very fabric of my being. Reduced once again to feeding on the unsuspecting and confused. That is who I am.

[DEEP GASP FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
ARCHIVIST
But you… You never tried to take revenge on Gertrude?

MICHAEL
She knew how to protect herself. She knew what she was creating. And killing her was not as important. She wasn’t as good an Archivist as you are.

ARCHIVIST
So why not kill me before?

MICHAEL
I had hoped that you would stop the Unknowing first, destroy the workings of I-Do-Not-Know-You. But instead you are here, and may bring it about faster. So better your death happens now.

ARCHIVIST
I-is there anything I can do to stop you from killing me?

MICHAEL
[Laughs] If you scream loud enough the Circus may take notice of me, but… I promise you will die far more pleasantly with me than with them.

[MORE LAUGHTER]
Ah…

[RAIN CONTINUES TO FALL]
ARCHIVIST
…

[Defeated] Okay.

MICHAEL
Good. Right this way.

[A DOOR CREAKS]
Open it. Open it, and all this will be over.

[THE ARCHIVIST TURNS THE HANDLE AND HEARS AN ENGAGED LOCK]
ARCHIVIST
Er, it’s…

[HANDLE IS TRIED TWICE MORE]
MICHAEL
What?

ARCHIVIST
It’s locked.

MICHAEL
It’s not. [Giggles]

ARCHIVIST
Why is it locked?

MICHAEL
It can’t be!

ARCHIVIST
Well, you try it!

[FRANTIC HANDLE TURNING – THE LOCK CONTINUES TO CLICK]
MICHAEL
[Worried] Th-Tha-That-That’s… not –

[Realisation dawns] Oh. Oh no.

[DISTORTED SCREAMS OF PAINFUL AND TERMINAL OPENING]
[THE NEW DOOR CREAKS OPEN]
HELEN
Do you want to come in?

ARCHIVIST
Wh… Helen? H-Helen Richardson? But… But y– Michael…

HELEN
Michael isn’t me. Not now.

ARCHIVIST
What happened?

HELEN
He got… distracted. Let feelings that shouldn’t have been his overwhelm me.

Lost my way.

ARCHIVIST
And now? Y-__you’re__ Helen?

HELEN
I don’t know. I never know, not really. Do I need a name?

ARCHIVIST
Ah… No, I s-suppose not.

HELEN
Helen is… better than Michael.

ARCHIVIST
But she’s gone.

HELEN
Yes. As is Michael. There’s only me.

ARCHIVIST
I… Okay.

HELEN
Do you still want to leave here?

ARCHIVIST
A-are you still going to kill me?

HELEN
No. That was Michael’s desire, not mine.

ARCHIVIST
So… S-so what do you want?

HELEN
I don’t know. Helen liked you, so… there’s a lot to consider. But I will help you leave.

ARCHIVIST
Wait, is this… Mic– Y-You’re the Distortion, the, the, the Liar. How do I know this isn’t… a, a trick?

HELEN
And if it was, what would you do about it?

ARCHIVIST
…

Right. Right…

[Plaintive] How long have I… b-been here? There’s no… It was hard to keep track –

HELEN
Time is hard, Archivist. It’s difficult to follow without a proper mind, especially here. A while.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

HELEN
The door is open, if you’re ready?

ARCHIVIST
No, not, not really, but…

ELIAS
Look, John, I understand you’re upset.

ARCHIVIST
A month, Elias. And you did what, nothing?

ELIAS
I was doing everything in my power to locate you.

[DISMISSIVE SNORT FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
Everyone was working on finding the ritual site.

ARCHIVIST
You didn’t tell them I’d been kidnapped, though, did you?

ELIAS
It wouldn’t have helped matters. Martin’s research, at least, would have been sloppier.

ARCHIVIST
And imagine what might have happened if your rescue had been slower.

ELIAS
Sarcasm isn’t going to help, John.

ARCHIVIST
The only thing here that “isn’t going to help” is you. I am sick of relying on the kindness of things whose stated intention is to kill me.

ELIAS
[Irritated] I am sorry, John, that my powers have not yet reached the level of omniscience. And I am sorry that I have to spend so much time trying to help you develop your own faculties, rather than explaining everything to you like a child. But you have a job to do, and I cannot fight your battles for you.

ARCHIVIST
As far as I can tell, the only battles I’ve been fighting have been yours and Gertrude’s.

ELIAS
I should have thought preventing the horrific transformation of our world is not solely my concern!

ARCHIVIST
…

Fine. At least we now know you’re of zero practical use here. So aside from sending me other people’s statements, what can you actually do to help?

ELIAS
I have been trying to give you the information you need.

ARCHIVIST
Sure, when you’re not bashing its head in with a pipe.

ELIAS
Leitner was… I will admit I possibly… overreacted to his sudden re-emergence.

ARCHIVIST
He could have helped.

ELIAS
You? No. To you he offered nothing but the crutch of simple answers. If I hadn’t stepped in he could have significantly stunted your development. Left you defenceless.

ARCHIVIST
[Sarcastically] Yeah. I can’t imagine what it must feel like to be defenceless.

ELIAS
I do regret…

Gertrude’s notes on the Unknowing are… lacking. I only shared the statements for a reason.

ARCHIVIST
S– You didn’t even know why you were sending them to me, did you? Just, what, a box of random files she labelled? You were hoping I could figure out the reason Gertrude chose them!

ELIAS
There is a possibility some of them were misfiled.

[DEEP BREATH]
ARCHIVIST
So what do we actually know?

ELIAS
John –

[TABLE SLAP FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
ARCHIVIST
Don’t you dare “John” me. If you want my help, I’m going to need that crutch.

ELIAS
Gertrude believed that the Unknowing was going to take the form of a dance. It required a great deal of intact human skin to clothe what she referred to as the, er, the “corpse de ballet”, though I suspect that’s just her sense of humour. There is also one, the “Danseuse Étoile” that requires a costume of special power or distinction. Gertrude believed that Orsinov and his circus created a dancer specifically for this role.

ARCHIVIST
I-I’ve met it. Calls itself Nikola.

ELIAS
There’s also something else in the notes she calls the Choir, but no real detail on that. As far as where it will happen, it’s a, a –

ARCHIVIST
A wax museum. Old, mostly a-abandoned, I think. I-I don’t know exactly where, but –

ELIAS
That still narrows it down significantly. I’ll, I’ll have the others start digging.

ARCHIVIST
How do we – How do I stop it?

ELIAS
Gertrude seemed to think that once the dance begins it’s tied to its location. Sufficiently disrupting that might be enough to derail the ritual. She mentioned she had acquired… something, for this purpose, but she gave no detail as to exactly what that might be.

ARCHIVIST
And you can’t just… See where she put it.

ELIAS
She was… She got very good at hiding things from me.

ARCHIVIST
How embarrassing for you. Is there anyone else who might know what it is, or, or where? Aside from Leitner, or Gerard?

ELIAS
Sorry, Gerard Keay?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… yes?

ELIAS
How did you… Who, who told you he was working with Gertrude?

ARCHIVIST
No-one, I-I-I just… I read it in one of the statements.

ELIAS
I don’t think you did.

ARCHIVIST
But… ah…

ELIAS
You just knew it.

ARCHIVIST
What, no, I… Th-that’s not a –

ELIAS
No, no, no. No, John, this is good. It’s a promising development.

ARCHIVIST
[Getting flustered] No, No I… It’s just, it’s just… just deduction or –

ELIAS
Is this the first time it’s happened?

ARCHIVIST
Look, look, I don’t – Look… Haaa… Gerard’s not really a lead. He’s dead. Isn’t he?

ELIAS
Yes, but I believe he and Gertrude travelled together, shortly before he passed away. Perhaps if we could retrace their steps, we might find something.

ARCHIVIST
And by “we”, you of course mean…

ELIAS
I’ll see if I can hunt down a few relevant statem– Ahh.

ARCHIVIST
What?

ELIAS
[Sighs] Melanie is on her way up here with a knife. Could you talk to her for me?

ARCHIVIST
O-ah. S-Sorry, what?

ELIAS
She’s hoping that even if I see it coming she’ll still be able to overpower me.

ARCHIVIST
Ah –

ELIAS
She’s wrong, of course, but I’d be keen to avoid that sort of struggle.

ARCHIVIST
She, she’s trying to kill you?

ELIAS
Yes. Again. Even more than the others she has a visceral hatred of being trapped. Regardless of how much freedom I afford her.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t – uh…

[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
ELIAS
Come in, Melanie.

[DOOR OPENS]
MELANIE
Elias, hi, just brought –

ARCHIVIST
Ah…

MELANIE
What are you doing here?

ARCHIVIST
Put the knife down, Melanie.

Melanie!

MELANIE
[Angrily] Get out of my way!

ARCHIVIST
I don’t believe – This isn’t the way.

MELANIE
You haven’t been here! You don’t know –

ARCHIVIST
I was kidnapped!

MELANIE
Oh. Sorry.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, yeah El-Elias… is –

MELANIE
Seriously?! Seriously? You too? Has he got everyone fooled? If he dies, we die? It’s not even a good lie.

ARCHIVIST
Why would – I mean, why would it not be true? If he’s managed to, to bind us… Why wouldn’t he be able to, to do that?

MELANIE
John, look at me. There is only one way out of this, and it is through him.

ARCHIVIST
I get, I get that you hate being here, Melanie, but do you really want to trade it for prison?

MELANIE
No! But the way I see it, the police seem really keen not to investigate crimes committed here.

ELIAS
That’s actually fair.

ARCHIVIST
Shut up!

Melanie, please.

MELANIE
[Frustrated anger] It’s not just being stuck here, John. It’s not just me. He’s manipulating you, he’s manipulating all of us. Can you seriously not see that? He’s pulling all the strings, and I don’t think there’s any other way to stop it. So get out of my way.

ARCHIVIST
Look, I-I’m sorry, Melanie, but we need him. We, We will… We will find a way to deal with i– with him. Not today. A-And not like this.

ELIAS
I am still here, you know.

ARCHIVIST
And if you weren’t, I assume you would be watching this conversation, so… Melanie, we can’t do this. Not yet.

MELANIE
…

Alright.

We’ll try it your way. But whatever your way actually is, you’d better figure it out fast. Because it is your fault that I’m here. Fix it, or get out of the way!

Statement of François Deschamps, regarding the family and presumed marriage of Benoît Maçon. Statement given June 4th, 2014. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Why do you need me to live it over again? To recount a story you know well enough already.

You were there, at least for the parts worth discussing. You want me to tell you what happened before then? How I met Benoît? His character? How he became my friend?

Truth be told, he was not my friend. He was simply a colleague, someone I might describe myself as well-disposed to, but probably not even that. It may seem dismissive to you, but in my experience there are two situations where one finds themselves working behind a bar when over the age of forty. The first is that you own the establishment yourself, what the English call ‘a publican’, and see no reason to hire others to perform duties you are quite capable of yourself.

The second is when a profound failure in your life has brought you to the middle of your life with no wealth, no prospects, and no skills that could be applied in more lucrative avenues. Suffice it to say that Benoît Maçon did not own Le Papillon Blanc.

It was not one of the most fashionable spots in Toulouse, sitting just on the edge of where the tourist-facing centre meets the firmly residential, and never quite settling on either side. It billed as a cafe in the day, but most of its business was after dark, when all pretence was dropped, and it became simply a comparatively cheap place to drink. I worked the bar there with Benoît and a few others, and had done for a couple of years since I left school. Of all the others who worked Le Papillon alongside me, I would probably have said that Benoît was the one who interested me the least. There was an air of sadness about him, a melancholy that I found unsurprising, given the position he had found himself in, but distasteful nonetheless. My own life has certainly had its hardships, and I cannot help but detest those who indulge in self-pity. Though… having seen his fate, perhaps some pity was earned.

Benoît was, as far as I could tell, all alone in the world, and rather unhappy about the fact. It was rare that the topic of parents or family would be raised or discussed without his appearing, as if from nowhere, to quietly volunteer the fact that his parents were dead, or his lack of siblings, or whatever it might have been. Whatever familial bond was the topic of conversation, Benoît Maçon did not have it, and expected, no, demanded that you pity him for the fact. It will not surprise you to learn he wore no wedding ring. That when a young couple would enter the cafe to pass their time in wine and affection, he would simply stare at them, his face a mask of ill-concealed envy. I am deeply grateful it was rare that we had children in Le Papillon, as the one time they came in while he was on shift with him, he vanished for almost twenty minutes and, when he returned, it was clear he’d been crying. All told, he was a pathetic, lonely man desperate for any human connection. A connection I had no intention of offering him.

Quite frankly, I believe I have spoken more words about Benoît Maçon in the last five minutes than I did in all the many months we worked together. I wasn’t even the one that noticed the changes in his behaviour. That was our manager Lucille. About five weeks ago, she offhandedly asked me if I knew of any “alteration” in Benoît’s personal or home life. He had, so she told me, been significantly more cordial with her over the previous few days. He had been smiling, laughing, generally not acting like himself. I told her I didn’t know and hadn’t noticed, but the next shift I saw what she meant. It was as though a different man were wearing the skin of Benoît, a man who had always known the deep joys of life.

I watched this new person go about their happy life for almost an entire night before I finally decided that I simply had to ask him what had happened. At first he appeared puzzled by my question, but when I told him how much happier he seemed, his smile grew wide. He leaned in close to me and looked around playfully, as if pretending to check for eavesdroppers. “A woman,” he said at last, “François, I am in love. And she loves me!” And then, without warning he grabbed me with both arms and pulled me into a short embrace, which I was simply too stunned to resist.

Up close, I could not help but notice the faintest of odours from his skin. It was a damp smell, like decaying wood, and it wasn’t until I had a chance to shower and change my clothes after work that I finally managed to rid myself of it completely. It was not a pleasant smell, certainly, but it was not awful. What bothered me was its presence at all. I knew Benoît to be a clean, almost fastidious man, prone to wearing slightly too much cologne. This was new, and beyond that there was… something to the smell itself, some memory of a childhood spent in the country around Lyon, of wandering out in the damp heat after a summer rain, of turning over logs slick with moisture, to reveal the crawling underbelly beneath them. But for the most part I ignored it. After all, if I could remain unconcerned about Benoît when he was miserable, doing so when he was happy hardly seemed like a challenge.

And indeed, he continued to be happy, almost to the point of bliss, for almost the entire month following. The smell was growing ever so gradually stronger, to the point where I would occasionally see my colleagues wrinkle their noses when he went to talk to them, but it never quite reached the stage where it felt worth bringing up with Lucille. Benoît’s hygiene more generally also started to noticeably decline. At first, his shirts would be wrinkled when he arrived for work, when before I had only ever seen him wear them crisply ironed. Then there were small stains or tears that could be spotted, as his clothes seemed to be washed less and less regularly. Again, none of this was glaringly obvious, and if his behaviour hadn’t drawn my attention, it’s likely I never would have noticed it at all. Certainly none of the patrons of Le Papillon Blanc ever seemed bothered by his appearance or cleanliness.

Through all of it, he would talk incessantly to anyone who would listen about this woman who had apparently changed his life, “mon petit scarabée”, his little beetle. I was never able to get her actual name from Benoît, as he only seemed to refer to her by that weird nickname. Clear details were also difficult to establish: he could talk for an hour over what his little beetle had told him over breakfast, but when asked about what she did, where she was from, what she looked like, he would always find a way to talk around it and shift the conversation in a new direction. We managed to establish that she had children, as Benoît would often make reference to “the little ones”, his eyes lighting up with parental pride. They couldn’t have been his, obviously, but that didn’t seem to matter to him. But, as with their mother, solid details about these children were almost impossible to establish. I would have suspected this new family of his wasn’t even real, were it not for the fact that he was clearly not faking his joy or contentment. Either his “petit scarabée” was real, or Benoît was suffering from a very complex delusion indeed. It never occurred to me it might have been both.

It was… two days ago that it happened. I was thinking earlier how unlikely it was, to have been looking so precisely at such a specific spot at such a specific time as to make me absolutely sure of what I witnessed. If I had glanced over a second later or only caught it from the corner of my eye, I could easily have dismissed it. After all, the simple presence of insects is not, in and of itself, remarkable. It was where this particular insect came from, however, that shook me so deeply. Benoît was leaning over the bar, listening to a young man who, I believe, was ordering for quite a large group. As this customer listed off his drinks, Benoît’s hand rested lightly upon the countertop, and I found, for no reason I could readily provide, my gaze was resting upon the fingers of his hand.

Without any warning, or reaction from Benoît himself, there seemed to be movement from the ring finger of his right hand. A slight shudder, a shifting of the skin beneath his fingernail. A small patch of darkness seemed to grow just below it, expanding until it resolved itself into the shape of an insect. It pushed itself smoothly and quickly out from below his fingernail and dropped down onto the bar, scuttling away and out of sight so quickly I lost it almost immediately. It had all happened in a matter of moments, and there was no blood, no reaction from Benoît, no evidence that it had truly happened at all, apart from my shaking legs and the feeling I was going to collapse. And it was in that state that your associate found me.

At the time I thought he was your son. His French was significantly better than yours, and it took some time and some difficulty translating before I could fully explain to you what had happened. You rebuffed all my questions about your interest in Benoît and his situation, as you resolutely have since. I am… telling you my story, since you have asked so nicely, but I will never truly forgive either of you for what you have shown me. I should have been more suspicious of this man, too old for his poorly dyed hair, leading me to an old woman who promised me answers in exchange for an address. I should have walked away. I shouldn’t have offered to go with you. But I was in shock from what I had seen, and I believe you could have told me to do almost anything, and I would have been unlikely to argue. You tried to cross-examine me about things I didn’t understand: “Étranger ou la saleté?” I honestly had no idea what you were talking about, but I didn’t put up a fight when you told me to get Benoît’s address. I don’t know why you agreed when I asked to come with you. I wish you hadn’t.

Do you really need me to describe it? You saw it for yourselves. The flowing tide that swarmed and scuttled as soon as the door opened. The smell that rolled out of that apartment like a choking wall. The thing that embraced Benoît. Mon petit scarabée. The only thing I don’t know is if you saw in as much detail as I did the look of sheer contentment and joy on poor Benoît’s face as his family crawled all over him. I don’t care about what the police might have done; your young colleague was right. You should have burned the place to the ground. I have nothing more to say to you.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

Th– [Sighs]

This is, um…

[PAPER RUSTLING]
This is written in French. A-All of it.

I don’t… I don’t speak French. I-I don’t read… I’ve never…

[Sigh] I wish I could find it in myself to be surprised.

[MORE PAPER RUSTLING]
Er, statement, it seems, given directly to Gertrude. Though not apparently recorded. Did she perhaps leave her tape recorder at home when she took this little ‘field trip’ with Gerard? June 2014. Barely a year before her murder, and less than half that before Gerard Keay’s brain tumour would lead to his own death. Did he know already? That his life was ending? Was he trying to accomplish one last good deed before the end? Were they both?

“Étranger ou la saleté?” Foreigner or dirt. Stranger or Filth. I can see why with limited information Mr. Deschamps’ account could lend itself to either interpretation: sudden appearance of a vague and previously unknown figure inserting itself into someone’s life on the one hand, and on the other… bugs and bad smells. Let it never be said the Hive and its ilk are subtle. Still, closer examination points pretty conclusively in that direction. It must have been a disappointment, especially if, as I suspect, Gertrude and Gerard were searching for information on the Unknowing.

Basira did some cursory follow-up on the statement itself. Benoît Maçon definitely died in late June 2014, but the Toulouse police records regarding the matter are firmly sealed. François Deschamps has refused our request for a follow-up interview. He did forward us one item, however. [Snorts] I can’t read the French on this one, but it appears to be a crudely printed wedding invitation. Benoît Maçon is the only name legible on it, as most of the details are obscured by a wide variety of dried stains.

Most helpful of all, though, is the simple fact that Gertrude was in Toulouse in June 2014. The information I found from her laptop doesn’t give a complete picture of her travels, but now I know when to look, and it appears that when she left Toulouse she did not return to London. Instead, it looks like she took several connecting flights, eventually ending up in Wellington International Airport in New Zealand. I can’t find any other details on the computer, but I’m going to ask the others to see if they can hunt down any statements referencing New Zealand in or around mid-2014. It might be a wild goose chase, but it’s the best lead I have.

In the meantime I… I have a new flat. I should try to get comfortable, change the locks. Even if I might need to be leaving it for a while. Oh, and… I suppose I… I did tell Georgie I’d try to talk to Martin.

ARCHIVIST
You’re sure you don’t mind?

MARTIN
No, no, no, it’s fine, I’ve… I’ve kind of stopped noticing if I’m honest. They just sort of… turn themselves on these days.

…

Look I’m, I’m so sorry, John, I – Elias didn’t even tell any of us that you’d been kidnapped. I didn’t know – No-one else was telling me – And there wasn’t any –

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Hey.

Hey, hey, hey… It’s alright, it’s alright. Elias didn’t tell anyone, there was, there was no way you could have known. I-I mean, I wasn’t exactly here before.

MARTIN
No, you weren’t.

…

But I’m sure that if you could have been, you would have.

…

Are you alright? They didn’t hurt you?

ARCHIVIST
No. No, no, I’m… I’m okay. Just – I mean my skin’s in better condition than… ever.

Is that a weird thing to say?

MARTIN
A bit?

ARCHIVIST
It was basically all she talked about. Orsinov. I-It was – How’s everyone been?

MARTIN
Oh, well, we’ve, we’ve been fine. I mean… Well, not great. Tim’s still… not doing well. Melanie seems okay, but I get the feeling she’s… I don’t know, planning something?

ARCHIVIST
I – I got that feeling too.

MARTIN
Basira’s the only one doing – well, she seems weirdly calm about the whole thing. Like it’s… like she’s on a vacation or something.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe she just suits the academic life. What about Daisy?

MARTIN
Don’t see her much. Which is fine by me.

[UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE]
ARCHIVIST
Does the rest of the Institute know what’s going on down here? I mean, I never really paid attention, but…

MARTIN
N-Not really? I think? I mean, Tim’s been going on about it to anyone who listens, but I think they just… think he’s had a bit of a breakdown.

ARCHIVIST
Well, I mean…

MARTIN
I mean, they can quit.

Hannah just left to have her baby, though.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know who that is.

MARTIN
Yeah you do – Hannah? She works in the library. Black, kind of stocky. Had that whole thing with the milk in the break room last year?

ARCHIVIST
I, er… Sorry. I really don’t…

MARTIN
Well, anyway, I… Well, I think they all just see the Archives as kind of weird and leave us to it. Y’know? Better us than them.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, they’re not wrong.

[MORE UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE]
MARTIN
So… are you coming back or…?

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I-I don’t know. Probably not yet. There’s a lot of… I-I think I might be on a bit of a treasure hunt.

MARTIN
Oh?

ARCHIVIST
Treasure in the sense of the… the world not ending.

MARTIN
Oh.

ARCHIVIST
I will keep in touch. I’m, I’m going to need all of you digging into stuff.

E-Elias mentioned… he said you’d been… reading statements?

MARTIN
Oh… uh… yeah.

Um… He thought it might help.

ARCHIVIST
Right. I-I-I mean, they’re not… They haven’t…

You’ve been okay?

MARTIN
B-B… Yeah. I mean, i-it wasn’t fun, but… I mean, if it, if it helps then I –

ARCHIVIST
Okay. If you’re sure, just… Make sure the others help you, alright? Statements can be… If you’re not used to them it can… be a bit weird.

MARTIN
Er… Sure.

ARCHIVIST
An-anyway, I-I-I should go. I-I’ve got a few leads to follow up.

MARTIN
Right, right.

ARCHIVIST
I’m, I’m sorry, Martin. We haven’t… I know we haven’t talked much since… Sasha and everything.

MARTIN
Well, I mean it’s not too late, y’know. Unless the world ends.

[MARTIN LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

Statement of Dylan Anderson, regarding an unusual pig he acquired on his farm near the Marlborough Forest, New Zealand. Original statement given July 2nd, 2014. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Pigs are tricky. They are very intelligent animals. But I’ve found I can never completely bring myself to trust them. They can be your best friend, then tackle your legs from behind if they’re feeling mean. And when a pig hits you, you know you’ve been hit. It doesn’t help matters that I am acutely aware that a pig would be more than happy to eat me if the opportunity came up. They’re true omnivores, and they wouldn’t necessarily even do me the courtesy of waiting until I was dead. I’ve heard more than one grisly story of a farmer passing out drunk in a pigpen, and in the morning there’s only bones. I had my cousin, Melinda, visiting a few years back with her son, and I told her to make sure and keep the baby away from the pigs. I still remember the dawning look of horror on her face when I told her why, like she couldn’t believe that a pig would just… eat a baby. But most pigs would. Most pigs will eat just about anything that doesn’t stop them.

I feel I may be doing pigs a disservice here, to be honest. When I say a pig can be your best friend, I’m not exaggerating. They can be tremendously affectionate creatures, and I’ve known more than one pig that I’d put in the running against any of my human friends. But it’s hard to get past the idea that if my human friends would draw a cock and balls on my face when I’m sleeping off the drink, my pig friends might just… eat me. They probably wouldn’t. ‘Cause we’re friends. But they might.

It’s not even like I run a proper pig farm, I just keep a few at a time, since they’re quite handy to have about. A couple of pigs are a great way to dispose of waste, and their manure is great for composting. And, I can’t deny, when it’s their time, they are… quite tasty. And I do sell the meat, though I take a lot of pains to make sure people know it was raised cruelty free. I take care of them. The point is, I certainly have never had so many pigs that I would lose track. And I know I never bought or birthed the monster pig.

When I first called it that, it was just because it was huge. I never got a chance to properly weigh it, but it must have come in at around three or four hundred kilos. I don’t know if you know about pigs, but that’s big. Bigger than big. It’s a monster pig. I didn’t find out about the rest until… well, I didn’t know.

I don’t know when it came from. I didn’t buy it. I didn’t take delivery of it, and as far as I can tell, no-one else did either. It’s a bit hard to tell as this was back in March, so the Merlot harvest season was well underway. As you’ve seen, while I do have a few pigs, this is a vineyard. We supply grapes to a lot of the bigger winemakers around here, and I’d been toying with the idea of starting my own label but haven’t really done anything with it yet. Oh, uh, when you’re writing this up, make it’s clear that we’re near the Marlborough Forest, but that’s not the same thing as the Marlborough region, which is famous for wine. That’s on the South Island. I just don’t want there to be any confusion.

Where was I? Yeah, it was the height of the Merlot harvest, so most of us, myself included, were out in the vineyard for pretty much the whole day. I hadn’t checked on the pigs in a while, but the next time I headed into the sty… there it was, sat in the corner, just encompassing the corner, its bulk filling the place out as the other, smaller pigs, tried to find somewhere to be that wasn’t next to it. It just sat there, and stared at me. I didn’t like staring back at it. It made me feel strange, like it was sorting me into cuts of meat. There was more in those eyes than I’d ever seen in another pig; hidden among the rolls of pink flesh, they had malice in them. The pig wanted to hurt me. I’m sure of that.

I-I didn’t know what to do. I just – I asked around to see if anyone knew where it had come from, but no-one had any idea. They were just as baffled as I was. Though they could see it, which was, you know, a relief.

Or not, since it being real meant it had to be fed. Part of me did consider immediately trying to send it for slaughter, but… but something about the way it looked at me, almost daring me to try it, a thin trickle of pink saliva glistening around its mouth. I’m absolutely sure if I’d asked Manawa, or any of the others, to bring it out for that, they would be dead. In fact, the more I think about the whole situation, the more certain I am that the monster pig wanted nothing more than to kill and eat me. It just didn’t want the hassle of breaking out of the sty. Though I’m sure it could have if it really wanted to.

I tried to feed it, but it was so huge, it ate so much, and there wasn’t enough for all the others as well. It wouldn’t need to be violent. It would just shift its mass towards the trough, and the other pigs would just be moved aside. When it ate, I got a closer look at that mottled body. It was covered in small lumps and marks that at first I thought might have been ticks or some other sort of parasite. But as I got closer, I saw that they were scars. Shot scars, most of them, with some that looked like they might have been from spikes or axes. One of them… looked like finger marks. As I stared at it, still stood in the pen, my eyes darted again to the gate and the lock that was now looking far too flimsy. It could just leave and – and attack; there was nothing I could do to stop it. I just watched it eat all the food.

Not enough food, apparently, since after a few days of this, it decided to supplement its diet with poor Toby. I’d looked after Toby since he was born. I’d helped birth him. He was my friend. So when I saw what was left of him lying in the pigpen on that damp Tuesday morning, I’m not ashamed to say that I cried. He was the first of my pigs to go, but I was sure he wouldn’t be the last. I tried to get the other pigs out a couple of times, move them to another pen, but the monster would start to shift its weight towards me with alarming speed, and I would always run away like a coward. The only time I seemed to be safe was when I was bringing food.

This went on for months. My brother, Kurt, came for a visit at one point. He said he planned to stay a couple of weeks, but the very first night I was woken up by the sound of movement outside of the farmhouse. I grabbed a torch, popped on my boots, and headed outside. I didn’t even consider not checking the pig sty first. Sure enough, as I got close, I heard something, though it wasn’t entirely clear what it was. It wasn’t the sound of a colossal pig eating my brother though, so that was encouraging. It was him, though, stood there, staring into the darkness. He was muttering something to himself. I think the words were, “Long pig. Short pig. Wide pig. Narrow pig.” Over and over. “Long pig. Short pig. Wide pig. Narrow pig.” He didn’t seem to be entirely conscious, so I was reluctant to wake him. I didn’t think it was a nice situation to become aware of all of a sudden. That said, when he reached over and started fumbling with the latch, I quickly changed my mind, and shook him awake. His eyes snapped open properly and immediately focused on something behind me, in the sty. I didn’t need to look around or ask him what he was looking at. His pale, stricken face told me plain enough what it was.

To his credit, he managed to stay another three days before he had to return to London on a ‘business emergency’. For context, I’m pretty sure he works as a traffic warden. And still the pig just sat there. Waiting.

I believe it was the circus that got your attention though, wasn’t it? That’s what you were asking about when you turned up. So, the Carley Brothers Circus mostly tours around Australia, but every couple of years they do a New Zealand tour as well. They do a few other spots around the Pacific, but the important point for this story is that this is one of the years they’re doing New Zealand. Now, generally they need anywhere between a couple of weeks and a month of moving things over, setting up, and getting all the right permissions and arrangements in place before the tour begins in earnest. I went to school with the brother of the guy who runs it, so the last couple of years they’ve done this, I rented out one of my larger, unused fields to them for their staging area. It’s pretty easy money, and they don’t need to use my facilities, and tend to be almost entirely self-contained. The first year they did it there was a lot of trash left behind we had had to clean up, but apparently someone bashed the right heads about it, since last year there was barely a cigarette stub left.

So the arrangements are all made, and the Carley Brothers Circus moves onto one of my fields for a month. I get drunk with the ringmaster and a couple of acrobats. So far, so normal. I almost forgot about the monster that lived in my pigpen. Almost.

A few weeks passed without anything happening. Then one of the clowns disappeared. A man named Angus Dale. He’s been a member of the circus for almost ten years now. No drink or drug problems, and no issues with his personal life, nowhere particular else to go. Exactly no reason to up and vanish from his job without telling anyone where he’s going. They started a search of the Marlborough Forest, they informed local police, they started discussing the best ways to publicise the disappearance.

I’m sure you can guess where this is going. Through it all there was this dark little suspicion growing in my mind. I never saw any evidence for it, not really. Nothing that would stand up in court, but even so, the suspicion grew into a theory, which grew into a certainty. That pig, that monster still squatted in my sty. The lock hadn’t been damaged or left open, so it was hard to see how it could have gotten out to attack a clown, or even how Angus might have gotten in. But I know he did. I know that thing killed and ate him.

I keep having this dream. I used to watch the rehearsals for the Carley Brothers’ performances, and I can clearly remember Angus Dale’s voice, or at least his clowning voice. I was watching him perform, but instead of a comedy skit or a bit of slapstick, he would sink his teeth into his limbs with this crunching, cracking sound, gradually eating himself. But even with a mouth full of meat, his laugh was still clear as a bell, his jokes and pleas for mercy clearly articulated. He never gave any sign he was in pain, but every few seconds he would stop laughing or chewing, and just repeat the words, “Long pig. Short pig. Wide pig. Narrow pig,” before starting up again. When I finally managed to drag myself out of bed the next morning, there was a bright, white, human femur on the ground in the pig sty, lying in front of the enormous fleshy form that just gazed at me in horrid triumph.

I didn’t want to tell anyone. That would have brought investigation, the police, efforts to exterminate the man-eating thing that looked so much like a pig. It wouldn’t go how they expected, I was sure of that, and I didn’t know what to do. Would it kill more people if I just left it alone, or if they tried to kill it? I never had much call for ethics before really, it was just… grapes and pigs. And when faced with that choice, I found myself completely paralysed.

After about ten minutes standing there in silence, staring at that bone, I walked into the pen, and I lay down motionless in front of the monster pig. Thinking now, that decision seems alien to me, but I think I just couldn’t stand the thought of going any further in the story that was playing out in front of me. It smelt awful on the floor, and as the pink form began to move towards me, my resolve started to waver. It was far too heavy to be supported by its skinny, twig-like legs, but something still propelled it slowly forward, inch by inch, that familiar pink drool leaving a thin path for the enormous body to follow, until it was right on top of me.

I closed my eyes and gritted my teeth, waiting to feel the pain of it starting to tear into my flesh. But instead, I felt it settle next to me, the meat of it sinking into the spaces left by my position. It was pressing up against me, and let out the most contented sound I have ever heard from a pig. The message could not have been clearer: ‘Friend’.

I don’t know how long I lay there in that stinking pig sty, listening to the calm, relaxed breathing of the murderous thing that had chosen to spare me. Eventually it retreated to its corner, and I stood and walked back into the house.

If you hadn’t turned up that evening, I don’t know what I’d have done. I know a monster pig wasn’t what you were looking for, but I do appreciate your advice. When you explained the situation, I hoped you’d have some special trick for dealing with it, but I suppose welding scrap metal around the pen and filling it with cement just about works, even if I do owe Mason a favour for borrowing his mixer. I’d have thought the thing would at least try to break free while I did it, but… thank heaven for small mercies, I suppose.

A huge block of solid concrete. What ought to do with it? Some sort of engraving, maybe? “In memory of Toby”? I can’t very well put it up “In memory of Angus”. That’s what really gets me, to be honest. Those pigs didn’t deserve what that thing did to them. Tearing them apart and eating them. Neither did Angus, of course.

The circus is still around if you want to talk to them, but the search for Angus Dale is still going on, so I’d appreciate it if you didn’t bring my name up. Oh, and if you’re hungry, I’ve got some bacon in the freezer I’m going to cook up.

What?

Statement ends.

ARCHIVIST
Another dead end for Gertrude, it seems. Assuming it was Gertrude Mr. Anderson was talking to, but I feel that’s a safe assumption, as the tickets to Wellington were only for one. Perhaps Gerard joined her later? I can only imagine her frustration upon chasing down a mysterious disappearance with a circus connection, only to find herself instead trying to help contain an evil pig. Too much meat.

The disappearance of Angus Dale is still an open case though, no leads have been found since a possible reported sighting in 2016 that didn’t amount to anything. Martin attempted to make contact with Mr. Anderson himself, but after a few unanswered emails and calls ringing out, I think we can safely abandon that hope.

There is one loose end I’m hoping might amount to something though. Mr. Anderson mentioned his brother, Kurt, emigrated to the UK, and works as a traffic warden. At least, as of 2014. Melanie’s seeing if she can hunt him down. If he’s still around, there’s a possibility he might be able to fill in a few of the… missing pieces. I currently have nothing to indicate where Gertrude might have travelled next, but I… I have a hunch Kurt Anderson might be able to help.

Yeah, why?

Dylan Anderson is your… is your brother?

KURT
Yeah… Why is he in some kind of trouble?

ARCHIVIST
Oh no, I-I-I want to… I just have a couple of questions.

KURT
Look buddy, I’m not sure about –

ARCHIVIST
It’s about a pig he owned back in 2014.

KURT
Woah. No, I don’t know anything about that.

ARCHIVIST
Well, it’s kind of a weird one – No, look, I know we haven’t met…

KURT
[Insistent] I don’t know what you’re talking about.

ARCHIVIST
[Sighs] Fine…

What do you know about the pig?

KURT
I only met it once, and it freaked me right out. I haven’t been back since. But Dylan says he managed to get rid of it.

ARCHIVIST
Did he mention an old woman who helped him?

KURT
Yeah, but he didn’t say how. Told me some weird guy turned up afterwards, and she went off with him in a real hurry. Left heaps of stuff behind and all.

ARCHIVIST
Er, w-w-what, what stuff did she leave behind?

KURT
I don’t know, papers, letters, a couple of old plane tickets. Now listen, dude …

ARCHIVIST
No, no, did he say what he did with them?

KURT
He sent them to me, asked me to get them back to her.

ARCHIVIST
A-And did you?

KURT
No, couldn’t be bothered. Then I forgot. I’ve still got them somewhere, I think.

ARCHIVIST
I, um, I, I work with her. Could I … could I collect them?

KURT
No! I don’t even know you! Just get away, dude.

Weirdo. Leave me alone.

ARCHIVIST
B-B-B-But those papers are very important.

KURT
Get away from me.

ARCHIVIST
Fine, fine, just…

What’s your darkest secret?

KURT
I don’t know. Er, sometimes I take little bribes, and not give people a ticket.

[Realises] Oh, what the hell?

ARCHIVIST
Right, okay, I imagine Lambeth Borough Council would be very interested to know that, and I have it on tape. So… let’s go get those papers, shall we?

Sure. Why down here?

I, um, E-Elias, I-I think… I think he has a hard time seeing things down here.

DAISY
I.e. he’s not watching?

ARCHIVIST
Maybe? I’m, I’m pretty sure it takes him actual effort, so… and it’s Wednesday afternoon, when he does his scheduling. So I’m hoping he’s distracted.

…

He, er… he loves scheduling.

DAISY
Right.

So, if he’s not paying attention, and I kill you down here…

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t risk it.

DAISY
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
Look, I’m… I’m going away for a while. The, the things I’m, I’m looking for they’re… they’re not in England, not in the UK, I don’t think. So I… I just wanted to, to ask, make sure you were going to look after the others.

DAISY
That’s my job. Now. Apparently.

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I I don’t just mean Basira. E-Elias…

DAISY
I’ll keep an eye on them. That all?

ARCHIVIST
No. No. I was, I was… I was thinking. This… Section 31 unit that, that you’re a part of –

DAISY
[Insistent] Not a unit! Just paperwork.

ARCHIVIST
Right but, but… what do they think about Elias?

DAISY
Best avoided. Pretty harmless. Um, crimes involving the Institute get people sectioned, but he’s not an active threat.

ARCHIVIST
If we had evidence that he was an active threat, that he was killing people, he, he was the one threatening to make all of your stuff public, do you think they’d move against him?

DAISY
…

Maybe.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, he’s got knowledge, but I-I don’t know how much that would help in – What?

DAISY
You sure you want to talk with that thing running?

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Um, I-I… I didn’t … didn’t realise I’d turned it on.

DAISY
Huh. We don’t know how he’s watching. No evidence.

TIM
Well, they haven’t.

TIM
Martin! What is The Unknowing? And what does it have to do with the Circus?

MARTIN
It’s… it’s uh, uh, a ritual. I don’t know the… it’s, it’s bad. Like, like really bad. Like, maybe ‘end of the world’ bad. And the Circus is doing it, the, the, the Russian ones, the, uh, Circus of the Other.

TIM
[High-strung giggling] No, no, no, no, no. No, we haven’t – There hasn’t been a Circus statement since Leanne Denikin’s last year, and that was a dead end! There’s… someone would have told me.

…

[Bitterly] Statement of Timothy Stoker, on the disappearance of… of my brother, Danny, four years ago. June 14th, 2017.

MARTIN
Thank you.

TIM
Statement begins.

TIM (STATEMENT)
My little brother Danny, he was always better than me. He was a couple of years younger, but by the time he hit 21 he was already taller, fitter, better looking. I mean, he didn’t have my winning sense of humour, but he didn’t need it. Charisma, it wasn’t a problem for him. I think a lot of people in my situation would have been… jealous, but not me. I was just proud of him. He was always doing some, some charity race or endurance course, getting modelling gigs, while I worked quietly away in publishing. And it made me smile.

I remember, he actually got a job doing some publicity shots for the company that owned my local gym. There was a good five months where, whenever I walked down to my offices, there he’d be, twice as large as life, smiling down from a poster, and challenging me to take them up on their joining fee, or lack thereof. I never did, but it always brought a smile to my face when I saw it.

We didn’t really talk much, me and Danny. We were still pretty close, and he’d usually keep me updated on whatever his latest obsession was. He tended to throw himself into a thing completely for about six months, and well, then he’d get bored, and something new would catch his eye. Like, um, back in 2013, it was urban exploration. He’d come down to London, stay with me for a couple of day’s and we’d end up having drinks with, er, Abigail Ellison, who’s a mutual friend of ours from back home.

Abi had been doing the urban exploration thing on and off for a few years, and was telling us a few of her ‘close calls’ in some of the sites down near the old Docklands. As she talked, I was just watching Danny’s eyes light up, and I knew exactly what was happening. His passion for sailing was starting to wane after almost a year, and I was sure I was watching him discover his next project. When Abi mentioned she had a trip lined up for the old Millennium Mills in Newham, well, it was pretty much a done deal. At the time I quite liked the idea. It wasn’t the weirdest thing to ever catch Danny’s attention, not by a long shot, and secretly I thought he and Abigail would maybe make kind of a cute couple, so I was quite encouraging. Not that he needed it.

It’s weird, isn’t it, the things that can change your life? You can plan for all the devastating, terrible possibilities you can imagine, and it’ll always be those tiny, unexpected things that get you. You know, the things that you never even noticed as they were happening, just… just nudging everything into motion. But even if there was a way I could have known, I really don’t think I’d be able to have stopped him.

So, for the next few months that was it. My cool little brother was an urban explorer. It suited him, and I got used to my phone buzzing at my office desk as he filled it with pictures of his smiling face in front of some, I don’t know, rusted machine or hidden tunnel. He never did get together with Abi, but it only took a couple of trips with her, and he’d learned what he needed. He talked a few of his friends into it, like always, started going on trips further afield. I thought he’d be down in London more than he was, but it turns out there are even more interesting abandoned places up north, and they tend to be less guarded than they are down here, so that was where he spent most of his time.

There was one thing that did draw him down to London, though – what he referred to as “ghost buildings”. There might have been some official name in the urban exploration community, I don’t know; he stopped using the jargon around me after I joked that ‘urbex’ sounded like a brand of drain cleaner. What he was talking about was the places where newer buildings had been constructed in or, I don’t know, over the remains of an earlier one, but development had left some of the old pieces intact. Sometimes, it was just a wall or two, made out of a different material, but occasionally there’d be an entire hidden basement or bricked up room. I don’t know why, but Danny loved them. He’d talk for hours about “crumbling pieces of history desperately clinging onto existence”, but to be honest I never really got it. I guess I didn’t have to. Anyway, according to him, London had more of these ‘ghost buildings’ than anywhere else in the country.

He’d been exploring for a few months when he first mentioned Covent Garden Theatre. It had been destroyed by fire twice since it was first built in 1732, and well, he was convinced that the current building stood on top of floors and floors of hidden and abandoned ruins, “the discarded cocoons of its previous life” as he once put it. He showed me maps and measurements, a few photo sets from others who’d apparently been there before. I never asked him to, but well, when he was excited, he just wanted everyone else to share it. That was… that was Danny. He was just… like that. While he was talking about the second Theatre Royal in Covent Garden, the one that lasted less than fifty years before it burned down, that was when I first heard the name Robert Smirke.

All through this, I was trying to talk him out of going because, well, what had once been the Covent Garden Theatre is nowadays known as the Royal Opera House, which is about as far from an abandoned building as you can get. And I really didn’t think that trespassing there would be a good idea. But Danny didn’t want to hear it. He wasn’t going into the main building, he told me, and had figured out a route he claimed would lead him into the abandoned levels below without crossing anywhere that might actually attract security. And he was going alone, so he didn’t need to worry about attracting too much attention. I told him it was a bad idea, but I’d never been able to stand in the way of his confidence. So late on Wednesday night in August 2013, my little brother went to break into the ruins hidden under the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. It sounds so ridiculous to say it out loud, but there it is.

I don’t know how long he was gone. I went to bed around one in the morning, and he hadn’t gotten back. It was a hot night, and I woke up a few hours later needing a glass of water. There were the first hints of dawn filtering in through my living room windows, giving it this quiet, otherworldly feeling. Danny was sat in my big armchair, completely still. I smiled, feeling suddenly a little bit unsettled, and trying my best to hide it. I’d asked how it had been, but he didn’t answer. I asked him if he’d found anything, and he nodded slowly. I saw as he tilted his head that his cheeks were just wet with tears. He mumbled something then, very quietly, and I couldn’t really make it out, but it sounded like the name ‘Joey’.

It was all kind of surreal, strange, and I started to think I might be dreaming, but I’d never seen him cry before. I tried to talk to him, find out what was wrong, but he just kept shaking his head. We sat there in silence for a long time. I didn’t know what to do; the whole situation was so alien. I thought maybe I could try and get him some rest, let him collect himself, so after some coaxing, I got him onto the couch. As he laid down, I heard him say something else. I thought it sounded like “the show must go on”, and at that moment, you know, I actually thought that was a good sign. I watched for a few more minutes until he was asleep, and then I went back to bed, though it was a while before I fell back to sleep.

That night was the last time I ever saw Danny. When I woke up a few hours later, he was gone. He left no note, no hint of where he may have gone, and the only thing that showed he’d been back at all were a small pile of sketches he’d drawn on some scrap paper from my printer. On each there was a clown, the same clown. A shock of dark hair, vertical on the top of his head, porcelain white face, bright red lips painted in a wide, pointed smile, and a crimson diamond running down each cheek from just below his eyes. The lips may have been smiling, but the mouth my brother had drawn was dark, an empty circle that made me feel cold.

I should have called the police. Well, maybe not, now I’ve met some of the ones who’ve dealt with these cases. But I shouldn’t have followed him. I shouldn’t have checked the notes Danny left about where to get in, and what to watch out for en route. There was never really any hope for me, though, was there? This was how it was always going to go.

Danny’s notes were very comprehensive, and finding the entrance to the old, disused part under the Royal Opera House wasn’t nearly as difficult as I thought it might be. He hadn’t reattached the chain he’d broken to get in, and it didn’t look like anyone had noticed to replace it. The entrance stood open, and even though it was the middle of the day, it became almost completely dark as soon as it crossed the threshold. I think he must have done some work on the hinges too, because even though I could see the rust eating through them, the door opened in complete silence. I stepped inside.

Back then I didn’t know enough about Robert Smirke’s architecture to recognise his work; I just thought it was a really well-preserved sub-level. The corridors were wide and solid, and my torch showed columns that were that regular geometry that I’ve come to recognise. Compared to the summer heat outside, the air was cold. I found myself shivering in just my T-shirt and shorts. The whole place looked spotless, a lot cleaner than any pictures I’ve ever seen of urban exploration or abandoned sites. I couldn’t really see why the Royal Opera House above wouldn’t use this space, why they’d just let it sit here untouched and hidden behind a locked and unmarked steel door just off of James Street. I was still wondering about this when I walked into the auditorium.

At the time I wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking at, but I’ve now seen pictures of the second Theatre Royal in Covent Garden, the one designed by Smirke, and I can say it was identical. A perfect recreation of the old stage and tiered seats, the decorations and the boxes. There were only two differences: that it was almost twenty feet below the ground where the original stage was, and that everything, from the floor, to the seats, to the blank and faceless audience was entirely hewn out of crude stone. There was no light except for the headlamp I had taken from my brother’s pack, and it swept over a full house, four levels of unmoving stone watchers, two thumb-sized indentations focused towards the stage. There was nothing that indicated they were any newer than the rest of the place.

I walked down the steps to the edge of the top level, where I’d entered, and I looked down towards the stage. My lamp barely illuminated the single figure that stood on it. [Deep exhalation] It was Danny. At least, I, I think it was. It looked like him; the same hair, the same clothes, but there was something not right about how he looked. Like he was smaller, somehow, slightly folded in on himself. It didn’t matter; I shouted down to him, to let him know I was there. He didn’t look up, but when my voice echoed around the stone theatre, I knew I’d made a horrible mistake.

From somewhere above me, a spotlight suddenly turned on, shining down onto the stage, painfully bright against the white stone. The air became uncomfortably hot, and there was some sort of music. The spotlight wasn’t on Danny. Instead, it picked out a figure crouched in the corner. All ruffles, and polka dots, and tights. A clown. It crouched and contorted in the corner, hands backwards over its face, but not so much that I couldn’t see the dark red patterns that seemed to flow down its eyes. I couldn’t move.

Slowly, so slowly, its right arm reached out towards Danny. It placed its hand on the floor with a long, low groan, then pulled itself along the floor, the fabric of its colourful dress scraping the rough stone of the stage, and its cheek rubbing against the ground, leaving a trail of red behind it. Then it was still for a second, before a leg reached out in front, and it began to drag the rest of the clown behind it.

I always tell myself there was some force there. Something that held me in place and meant that all I could do was watch. But sometimes when I think back, I remember how my legs shook, and maybe I could move. Maybe I’m just a coward.

The clown reached my brother, who still hadn’t moved an inch, and unfurled to its full height. The red on the cheeks was now clearly blood, and something black oozed down from its shock of hair. It took Danny by the hand and looked up, right at me, smiling like nothing has ever smiled since. “Shall I?” he asked, with a voice so full of playful mischief that I felt bile rise in my throat. I wanted to shake my head, say no, but I never got a chance.

With a single, smooth motion, like whipping the tablecloth off in a restaurant, he pulled the skin off of whatever had been pretending it was my brother. I don’t know how to describe it. It was like an impressionist painting of a dancer, all colours and shapes that made you feel movement you couldn’t see. Silently, imperceptibly, moving from one position to another. The music had stopped and the dance was silent. It was beautiful.

The next thing I remember was the cool night air on my face, as the opera house patrons pushed past me to get into the evening performance of Tosca. In my hands I held an old black and white circus flyer. It was written all over in Cyrillic, but in the bottom left corner was a certain clown’s face, leering out at me, billed as the guest performer. As I watched, it crumbled to ash, and floated away on the breeze.

MARTIN
That was the last time you ever saw your brother?

TIM
Yeah.

MARTIN
You never went back?

TIM
To the auditorium? No. If I had, I… I don’t think they’d let me leave a second time.

MARTIN
That’s why you joined the Institute, isn’t it?

TIM
I thought I might be able to find something about what happened, but… I guess at some point I stopped seriously looking, and started to just… get comfortable.

MARTIN
Until John…

TIM
Until the Archives, yeah.

MARTIN
…

Tim, the, the clown that you described is –

TIM
Yeah, I know. It didn’t take too much looking around to match the description of Victorian London’s most famous clown

[MARTIN SIGHS]
Joseph Grimaldi. A Covent Garden theatre regular.

MARTIN
I mean, 200 years is a long time, but…

TIM
Yeah, it’s him, though. Or it looks like him. Or his ghost or something. I don’t know why, but… I think he’s with the Russian circus.

MARTIN
Yeah.

TIM
You’re reckon they’re trying to what, end the world?

MARTIN
I mean maybe it’s not… yeah, I think so.

TIM
And no one told me.

MARTIN
You were never here to tell, Tim.

TIM
Well, I am now! I don’t care about the rest of it, if anyone’s going to find that Circus, I’m coming too. You’re not going to stop me!

MARTIN
I mean, sure, sure, I think that’s actually a good i–

ELIAS
Knock, knock.

TIM
[Sighs] Great.

MARTIN
Oh.

ELIAS
Martin, would you give us a moment?

MARTIN
I… uh…

ELIAS
Please.

MARTIN
Uh, right, um, s-sorry, Tim.

[THE DOOR CLOSES]
TIM
You were watching, then?

ELIAS
Most of it.

TIM
Surprised you didn’t know it already. That’s your thing, isn’t it?

ELIAS
I knew there was some trauma that drew you to us, but I can’t say I ever thought to look much deeper. An oversight, perhaps, but I’m looking now.

TIM
All right, hit me with your X-ray eyes then, boss. What do you see?

ELIAS
Disruption. An unpredictable, angry man with nothing left but the desire to feel in some way revenged.

TIM
[Sarcastic] Ooh, terrifying! Surely only magic could have let you see so deep inside my very soul.

ELIAS
Tim, I’m only going to tell you this once. Please stay away from The Unknowing, the Circus, all of it. I don’t believe you can help, and I don’t know what will happen if you get involved.

TIM
Oh sure. I’ll just forget about it. Go back to sulking in a corner.

ELIAS
Tim.

TIM
Don’t worry about me, boss, I’ll just stop. It’s what I’m best at, right? Don’t want to get in the way of your evil plans, do I?

ELIAS
I mean it, Tim.

TIM
[Incensed] Oh, oh, you mean it? Oh well, that’s different. Okay, well, let me tell you what. If you want me to ignore everything that’s going on, forget my brother and everything that’s happened over the last two years, how about you kill me?

ELIAS
…

I don’t want it to come to that.

TIM
Well, me either. But here we are. So my proposal for you is this: either kill me or fuck off.

ELIAS
…

I’ll come back when you’re feeling more… reasonable.

TIM
Then I guess I’ll see you in hell.

ARCHIVIST
You’re sure you don’t mind?

XIAOLING
Of course not. Recording is what we are here for.

ARCHIVIST
And this is the same statement that Gertrude checked out?

XIAOLING
I will check again with my assistant, but it’s the only one we have from 太平天国运动 1 written in English.

ARCHIVIST
The Taiping Rebellion? I assumed it would be about a circus or, uh…?

XIAOLING
I have not read it, but I would be surprised. I seriously doubt there were any circuses at the time. I believe it was like a, um, 见鬼 2.

ARCHIVIST
[Snorts] I-isn’t all war like a nightmare?

XIAOLING
Oh, 你说中文 3?

ARCHIVIST
I, I don’t, why?

XIAOLING

How long did you say you have been Archivist?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, about two years now.

XIAOLING
Well, Elias made a good choice. I did offer him someone, but he thought the language might be too much for him.

ARCHIVIST
Huh.

XIAOLING
我相信没关系是不是. 4

ARCHIVIST
I-I suppose not.

Anyway, I will leave you to your work. Let me know if you need anything.

The details I got from Gertrude’s documents lead me to believe that, before she made her way to New Zealand, she paid a visit here, to the Pu Songling Research Centre, Beijing. The centre is something of a sister organisation to the Institute, and while that means I have some… reservations about their motives, it does mean gaining access to their collection is relatively simple. According to Zhang Xiaoling, the librarian here, this statement was the one that Gertrude checked out during her last visit. So…

Statement of Second Lieutenant Charles Fleming, regarding his experiences during the Taiping Rebellion. Original statement undated, but apparently written in early 1862. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Yellow reeds and white bones. Yellow reeds and white bones. I hear it said so often now it almost has the rhythm of a joke. How can one have poetic clichés for a massacre? How can unspeakable carnage become so tired and repetitive? Even the most trite and poorly written of the penny bloods would, at least, make some show of a plot, or a purpose to the horror and the suffering. But here, beyond those pages, it seems the dead simply pile higher and higher on both sides, and nothing changes but the number of ghosts. On one side atrocities in the name of one who claims to be brother of Christ; on the other, slaughter in the name of the supposedly sane men who would stop him and his Heavenly Kingdom. And I find myself walking through the still and bloody landscape that has consumed all of China, scrawling my confessions on any paper I can find not yet saturated by mud and death. I am a stranger here, yet if you told me I were dead, and this place my just reward, I would not for one second doubt your honesty. I have seen no vision of hell that can compare.

Neither could I say I have not earned it. Not for nothing do these drowned and murdered faces pursue me. Nemesis was my ship, under Captain William Hall. I was so eager to serve my country, how could I question what they asked us to do? The trade in opium was a cornerstone of the Empire, and when called upon to defend it against those Chinese that would threaten Britain’s rule of the waves, what could I do but answer? Was ever a man so eager to have his country beseech of him his violence?

And there was violence aplenty aboard Nemesis. First of its kind. An iron warship. Small, lightly armed, but able to go where other British vessels never dared, far upriver to strike at the very heart of the Qing forces, where their defences were weakest, and the damage we could inflict most brutal. Captain Hall had a particular zeal for the work. He was a petty man, bitter, and never missing an opportunity to mention how long he had waited to command a ship of his own. Were I to judge solely based on the orders he gave, I would have been forced to conclude it was the Chinese who had slighted him, and now he exacted his vengeance. Truth be told, I simply believe he was possessed of a great cruelty. A cruelty I shared.

I remember we sank a Qing ship off First Bar Island. Cambridge, it was named, an old East Indiaman sold to the Chinese some years before. When she sank, a few crew made it aboard Nemesis, half-dead and utterly defeated. I cannot honestly recall whether Captain Hall ordered them drowned or whether I took it upon myself, confident in the Captain’s approval. Either way, it was certainly forthcoming. Theirs were the first faces that began to follow me. I would never have admitted that was why I paled when I passed by a looking-glass. Or why I shook my bunkmates awake, demanding that they stop singing.

Truth be told, no one knows how Nemesis sank. I certainly have my own beliefs, my own dreams of what may have reached up towards us and taken its price, dragging that dreadful iron curse to the bottom of the Canton River. All I remember is waking up to the screaming of buckling metal, the louder screaming of doomed men in the decks below, and that third, deeper set of screams, that sounded for all the world like a cry of triumph. I managed to get to the deck, and leap from the bow into the waters of the river. When I plunged below the surface and watched the hulk of Nemesis, twisted, and disappearing into the deep, deeper than the Canton River should have been, I saw the water around me full of corpses, but when I finally broke the surface, I was alone.

These corpses follow me still, though I am hard-pressed to see them now, surrounded as I am by death in all its myriad forms. If you ever wish to escape your pursuing guilt, there are few places so apt to hide it as a land devastated by unimaginable war. At least I shall not go hungry. I lost that particular moral qualm in Anqing. I believe thirty-eight fen was the going price for a pound of human meat by the end of the siege. Such a profound will to survive. In the end, it did no good. Zeng Guofan’s army breached the gates, and they put everyone inside to death. Sixteen thousand more corpses, soldier and civilian alike. There’s no difference anymore. Hide your hair braid beneath your hat, proclaim your allegiance until you have no breath left, compared to the danger of enemy spies or saboteurs, one more cadaver is nothing.

I’m lucky I still had my British uniform. Almost twenty years lost and abandoned in this country, a prisoner of the very opium I helped to force upon its people; I barely recognised myself putting it on. I’m lucky I never thought to sell it. It was an old design, a long way from the uniforms I see among my old comrades today, but it served well enough to get me through the Qing forces as they stormed through the streets. I am lucky, I suppose, that the only ghosts that chose to follow me were the ones I had to kill as I fled the city. I know there are others that see those behind me, and sixteen thousand lonely souls would be too much for them, I’m sure. They would be too much for me, but I’m not sure what that means anymore.

After the fall of Anqing, I wandered this desolate country, though for how long I do not know. Days went by with not a single living creature to be seen, and only the dead for company. Yellow reeds and white bones. It struck me then how few of the fallen had died by the hand of another. War kills just as surely with hunger and sickness, and for every one bloodied and murdered, there were ten wasted to nothing or black with disease and rot. I suppose there must have been a terrible smell, but there is nowhere here the wind does not chase me with that scent, and I can no longer tell the stench of decay from the air itself. They are one and the same.

Some months ago, I was captured. Not by the Taiping or the Imperial forces, at least they weren’t anymore. I believe they were once peasants, they had clearly never owned the building in which they kept me. There were three of them; one tall, who clearly spoke for his companions, one walking with a noticeable limp and an eye that refused to stop watering, and a third, whose right arm was so discoloured from a spreading infection, that he looked at me with a mixture of hate and helpless terror, as though I could do something to fix it. I did not fight when they barred my way with crude weapons levelled, and demanded my surrender. I have not fought since I left Anqing, and saw the true scale of the devastation.

Believing me to still be a British officer, they intended, it seemed, to ransom me; but they knew of no British forces in the area, so were arguing as to whether to offer me to the Qing army or the nearest rebels. The tall one was adamant that the Imperial Army, now allied with the British, would pay them for my safe return, while the limping man was horrified at the thought. He had cut off his braid, he kept saying, and they would think he was loyal to the Taiping. The third man just watched me, listening to his companions arguing, and laughing softly whenever they mentioned money. I believe that he was the only one who truly understood. When the dead that follow caught up with me, they broke those poor fools apart like twigs, and dragged all three of them below the ground. And they were gone. I found water among their possessions and a small bag of rotten rice, and relishing the chance to wash the taste of blood from my mouth, I ate. I could still hear my would-be captors’ voices, and I wondered how long it would be that I still had to wait for death.

Some choose not to wait, of course. I passed by the city of Hangzhou after it had fallen to the Taiping. The gate still stood open, as they were unable to close it for the dead. When the city was taken, the people had rushed out and thrown themselves bodily into the West Lake. It was solid with them. For three hundred yards you could have walked along their still bodies into the middle of the waters. I did, hoping against all hope that an arm might reach out and finally pull me down into that great mass of quiet death. But the waters of the lake were still and dark, and as I left, some who lay upon it rose to join me.

I have no idea where to go now. I have walked so long my feet are bleeding, and I see nothing upon the horizon but more slaughter. More days without the living. So I write this, that some small record of what I have done and what I have seen may continue on. I sit here upon the steps of a Manifest Loyalty Shrine, a small provincial one, erected by a local governor who wished to cement his power now the more central shines can no longer keep up with the number of the dead. But this one is mine. I look at the names of the fallen engraved on the walls, the long and storied lists, and I know that each name is borne by one of those that follow me. It is the list of those that wait for me at the bottom of these steps, though whether they wait to follow me further or to finally descend upon me, I do not know. But my name will never be carved upon this stone. Though war and death have found me in this land, I have no place here. I came for no cause but violence and greed, and have been humbled by the unimaginable brutality of true and total war. I have nothing left, except to hope that what remains of my own life is neither long nor memorable.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

Good Lord. I had heard that the Taiping Rebellion was… but that… I wonder how much of what Lieutenant Fleming says is true and how much is, uh… I almost hope it’s all supernatural. Some hideous hallucination or otherworldly hellscape. Part of me really doesn’t want to look it up.

It looks like Xiaoling was right though. No Circus. Nothing even that resembles the working of The Stranger. It… it seems to be purely war and violence, whatever power that might be. So why did Gertrude want it? I feel like… I’ve chased dead end to dead end until I finally give up. I-I mean, what am I actually looking for? Gerard Keay, after he faked his death? Some long confession he left tucked away in a library somewhere, telling me the ancient chant I need to stop the Unknowing from coming to pass?

[Sigh] Maybe this is pointless. I should head home, help the others in their research. If I knew Mandarin or Cantonese, maybe I could look here for more answers, but as it is these files…

Hang on, I think… I think this says 2004. Yes, 1992… 1997… 2004. If I’m reading this right, this file hasn’t been accessed for… wait. Ohhhh…

ARCHIVIST
So it’s been a waste of time then, has it?

XIAOLING
It was a very simple mistake. She did read that statement.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, in 2004, yes, but I-I need information about her visit three years ago. Did, did your assistant find anything about that?

XIAOLING
Yes. There were two accounts that Gertrude took out in 2014.

ARCHIVIST
A-and can I read them?

XIAOLING
According to our records, we don’t have them anymore.

ARCHIVIST
[Sigh] Well, Wh-what happened to them? Where are they?

XIAOLING
Apparently, they were sent on at the request of the Magnus Institute.

ARCHIVIST
Gertrude asked for them t-to, to be sent to her?

XIAOLING
I believe so.

ARCHIVIST
To the Institute or…?

XIAOLING
No, we have other channels of delivery for that.

ARCHIVIST
Then where?

XIAOLING
I believe it was an American destination.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Oh, would you still have a-a copy of the address?

XIAOLING
I think we do.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you, Xiaoling.

XIAOLING
Not a problem, 建筑师. 6

MELANIE
Jan Kilbride’s account of his time spent aboard the space station, uh, Daedalus. Statement date February 10, 2008. Melanie King recording.

Start.

[CLAP]
MELANIE (STATEMENT)
The hardest thing to imagine, to really get your head around, is, is the scale at which the universe operates. You can drill down so small that you reach particles and building blocks that your brain simply can’t connect to. The physical reality that you inhabit, the fact that the vast majority of your own body is empty vacuum space, filled only with the weak forces that are binding you disparate atoms to one another – that can only really be understood on an intellectual level. To really internalize that thought, to believe it, would be too much for most people.

And the other end – the sheer size at which the universe operates – literally cannot be fully conceptualized by the human mind. We have to reduce it to factors, or long strings of comparative zeros. Most people can’t even properly appreciate the size of our own planet, seeing only in crudely-rendered diagrams or maps. But compared to us, the planet is immense. More than large enough for the swell of humanity to grow, and ultimately extinguish itself.

Yet compared to the wider universe, it isn’t even a noticeable speck. The human mind would reflexively want a place at the midway point, a perfect center balanced between the incredible size of the universe and the unthinkable smallness of the subatomic. But this is nothing but ego – a manifestation of our obsession with considering us some sort of a normative benchmark against which all else is measured. In truth, we are so much closer to the tiny, mindless atoms that make up our bodies than we are to a universe so enormous that fully imagining it is simply impossible.

Even with all I’ve seen, I still can’t communicate it. I can’t make people actually understand how horridly, nauseatingly boundless this universe is, and when I think of it too deeply, I feel like I’m going to throw up. Like a sort of existential vertigo.

It never used to scare me like this. I used to take a sort of comfort in it, in the thought that we were so small, such a minor blip in the life of the universe. Where others saw insignificance and pointlessness, I found freedom. A sort of optimistic nihilism, I suppose.

I know now it was all just denial, of course. It’s not easy to be scared of something that you can’t even think about. I miss those days: smoking out the window of a tower block, looking out over the lights of the city blinking up in defiance of the void, and thinking how daft it was. Like an ant shaking its fist at a god.

I think that’s really why I wanted to go to space – to put it all in perspective. That for one moment, I could look down and see it all, every human that ever existed, the living and the dead, hanging below me on a tiny ball of carbon.

And you know what? It was worth it. At least, I thought so at the time. That moment, that first look at the earth falling away below us, it was everything I dreamed it would be. And how often is that true? The Daedalus was in low enough orbit that I never got the whole planet in view, as I had hoped. But it didn’t matter. The first time, looking down and taking in the sheer scale of it, remains the most magnificent sensation I have ever experienced.

I don’t know how they picked me for the mission. A representative of some private consortium approached me about a year beforehand. I’d put in my application a few times, but I, I never really expected anything. I had all the skills, but I knew I wasn’t anyone’s first choice of astronaut. I simply wasn’t exceptional enough.

Also, I thought… Mr. Fairchild didn’t mention exactly why I was chosen, though he did reference my psychiatric profile a few times in the interview. I didn’t want to press him too hard on the reasoning in, in case I somehow lost the opportunity. Idiot.

There were technically three of us up there, although I only really spent any time with Manuela. The other one who came up with us – Chilcott, I think his name was – he was apparently doing some sort of separate isolation study. Can’t say I envied him. The door to his section of the station was daunting, to say the least. I mean, I’m an engineer, and honestly it looked like it was sturdier than the actual hull.

Manuela and I were instructed not to attempt any communication with him, and to be honest, that was fine by me. On those occasions we had to call in to his little chamber through the intercom, usually as part of maintenance or a systems check, he always sounded so distant. This flat, tinny monotone that set my teeth on edge, like a subtle vibration.

So we left him to it. We had plenty of our own work to do, anyway. Manuela Dominguez was quite a big name in certain areas of the physics community – or, at least, she had been. I hadn’t heard of any work she’d done for a good few years. And, as I say, I’m more on the engineering side of things, so it wasn’t really something I kept up with in detail.

While she was happy to talk, Manuela apparently didn’t like to discuss her professional life on Earth, or the specifics of the research she was doing on the Daedalus. Like Chilcott, her research was kept entirely separate from mine. And while we spent plenty of time together, I never did figure out exactly what it was. Something to do with lasers, I think.

As for my job, to be honest, it felt disappointingly like busy work. Stress-testing, zero gravity effects, material evaluations – for every test I was told to do, I could have listed a half dozen studies citing similar research from the ISS, most of which had had pretty conclusive results. If you had told me I was just being instructed to do the same things they did over there, but two years later, I’d have been hard-pressed to argue.

But there was something else. A different sort of worry that was building up inside me. It was like a gradual increase of air pressure: you never notice it happening until your ears pop. I didn’t realize how intense the sensation had gotten until, all at once, I knew what it was – what I was feeling.

It was the sense of a presence, of there being something out there. Something that wasn’t the earth. And it was getting closer.

When it started, I tried to talk to Manuela about it, but she seemed to think I was talking about aliens and quickly changed the subject. I suppose, in a way, I was, but nothing like she was imagining. “Alien” might be the best word for that presence, but not because we were sat on the edge of outer space. Because what it made me feel was beyond anything I had words for.

And still it grew closer. When this thing, this being finally called out, I didn’t just hear it. I felt it, vibrating through me with such a shuddering intensity that I was sure my bones would break into powder inside my skin.

The whole station shook violently, rattling and pitching. My first instinct was to check that the Earth was still below us, and not the victim of some dreadful cosmic disaster. But when I reached the window, it still hung there, serene below us.

As I looked, I saw drops of red floating through the air in front of me. I reached up to my ears, and my hand came away wet. Don’t try to tell me sound can’t travel in a vacuum, I know. I pushed off towards my quarters and the medical kit, but as I began to move through the station, I stopped. I didn’t grab or hit anything, I did nothing to slow my momentum, I just stopped. Floating there motionless, feeling like the whole of existence was frozen in place.

Then slowly, carefully, I went to grab one of the handles, to pull myself out of this zero-gravity limbo. But I couldn’t reach. The station was cramped, so cramped that I could only fully stretch out in the section used to exercise, but now, somehow, in this tiny corridor, I couldn’t reach the walls. I flailed and I grabbed and I shouted, but somehow, it was all just too far away.

And I knew all at once that I would float there motionless until I died, and I saw the pointless illusion of the station – of the planet below – all hiding me from the uncaring expanse of the universe, in which I was now eternally trapped. The station was a hollow pretense of a shell that did nothing to separate me from the void.

And that cry came again, so loud and long and deep that it couldn’t not be the sound of a living thing, so vast and so ancient that thinking about it made me weep. And I screamed in turn.

My hands touched the rail at the exact moment that Manuela came to check on me. I was moving again. She asked if I was alright, though she clearly had no interest in the answer. She said she’d felt the station shake, but when I pressed, she claimed she hadn’t heard anything. Her eyes were red, and I noticed for the first time that the tips of her fingers were burned. I don’t know why I asked her, really. I knew then that she hadn’t heard it, that she would never hear it. And I felt completely alone. I remember I almost envied Chilcott, because at least he had known what he was signing up for.

The next month passed more normally, I think – though beyond a certain point, at the edge of everything you’ve ever known, the word “normal” loses its meaning. Manuela became more and more withdrawn, more focused on her own research, whatever it might have been, while I more or less stopped doing mine entirely. I got no new instructions. I would find myself staring out into space for a few minutes, and then when I checked the time hours would have passed. I don’t remember if I slept.

I honestly can’t remember if going out to work on the solar panels was repair work, or if I’d finally been given a new task that required going outside. I just remember sealing the bulky EVA suit and stepping into the airlock, pushing myself out, into the nothing.

The tether coiled out behind me, spooling meter after meter after meter… but I wasn’t going towards the solar panels. Why? Where was I going? I floated slowly off into the empty unending space, and the tether line just kept on going.

The station drifted further and further away. I could feel myself falling up, falling out, falling off of everything that could be called a world. The station was gone, as was the planet of my birth – everything that gave me my existence. It shrank as I watched, until it became less than the smallest dot.

I couldn’t have been that far away. It’s impossible. But I was. I was so far from all existence, surrounded by the vacuum of everything. I could feel my soul trying to expand, to fill never-ending absence. And it hurt.

I don’t know how long I was floating for. I know it was less than a billion years, which is barely a heartbeat in the life of the universe, so how can it really be said to matter?

The stars began to wink out, one by one, and I thought – perhaps for a second, perhaps for a hundred years – that I had reached the end of time, and I was watching the gradual fading of the universe. And then I realized the obvious: I could not see the stars because something was blocking them.

It moved and flowed across my vision. Every motion seemed to snuff out more light. There was no shape to see, no outline that could be drawn of this thing, so dark and enormous I could feel my stomach trying to vomit, my mind trying to expand, to take in the size of what moved between the stars, filling my entire vision and more.

I knew that if it chose to cry out, it would have destroyed me utterly. And I know that there was no possibility it could ever have noticed I existed.

I do not believe in God. I can’t believe that a being with such limitless power and knowledge would still notice humanity, would understand or care about its existence.

But I keep thinking back to an old professor of mine, back when I briefly studied neuroscience. Talking about consciousness, about how we still don’t honestly know what it is, where it comes from, what aspect of the brain makes it possible. And I wonder if there might not be consciousnesses out there so far beyond our comprehension that we could not properly recognize them as such. Minds so strange and colossal that we would never know they were minds at all. Perhaps, out there in the endless vast, they would not notice or recognize us in return.

And I wish that I could convince myself that ignorance was the same thing as safety. But then, how many weeds have you unthinkingly stepped on in your lifetime?

MELANIE
Statement ends.

Oh! That… um, well, that seems… that seems to be… that’s all of it? Hmm.

Well, Jan Kilbride definitely returned to Earth with his colleagues, and he certainly seems to have given this statement in person, so… I mean, he did come back somehow. Assuming he ever left. It might have been a hallucination of some sort. Isolation and stress can do odd things to you, of course. [heh] Not to mention the evident insomnia.

And if it is true – if what Jan Kilbride saw was real, I mean… to be honest, it sounds a bit beyond my paygrade. [heh] Whatever my paygrade is. And I have enough insomnia of my own to deal with.

I did do some checking on the Daedalus – I mean, you’ve got to do something, haven’t you? Mr. Kilbride seems to have the right of it, in terms of his job. There have been exactly zero peer-reviewed pieces of research that have in any way referenced or cited studies or tests conducted on the Daedalus. From the point of view of the scientific community, the project might as well have never happened.

Also, I um, I can’t find Jan Kilbride. He definitely returned. I found more than one photograph of the trio’s arrival back on Earth: Carter Chilcott being attended by medical personnel, and the other two looking tired… but alive. There are also a couple of short newspaper stories mentioning their safe return.

But it seems as though Kilbride made his way over to the Institute a few weeks after touchdown, made his statement, and then: nothing. I can’t find any sign of him, and neither can Basira or Martin. Not on Earth, at least. I really don’t want to say he vanished into thin air, but… he’s vanished into something.

Beyond that, there’s only a few things worth –

BASIRA
Are you ready for that drink?

MELANIE
Well – oh, yes, yes, just give me a second. Finishing off a statement.

BASIRA
Oh, sorry. I thought, you know, because the door was open…

MELANIE
Oh, no, no, I just needed a bit of air flow.

BASIRA
Yeah, it’s, it is not cool down here.

MELANIE
Summer in the basement, I suppose.

BASIRA
Yeah. You know, speaking of not cool – did Martin say he was coming today?

MELANIE
Wow. Ouch.

BASIRA
Oh, what, you’re gonna judge me? I literally don’t know anyone here you haven’t made cry.

MELANIE
You only know Tim and Martin!

BASIRA
And Elias.

MELANIE
I made Elias cry…?

BASIRA
I don’t know. Probably. You can be very mean.

MELANIE
[Hah!] Right, well… the jury’s still out on Elias. And anyway, Martin’s always been lovely to you.

BASIRA
Hmm. I don’t know, I mean, you should have seen him when I turned up last year. I think he thought I was trying to steal his precious Archivist.

MELANIE
Ahhh. I got the exact same when John was hiding out, and came to me with his “source on the inside” stuff. Martin was not impressed.

BASIRA
[ugh] That boy needs to relax.

MELANIE
Or at least find someone else to fuss over!

BASIRA
Yeah, he’s got it bad.

[PAUSE]
BASIRA
Do you know if he and John ever…

MELANIE
No clue, and not interested! Although… according to Georgie, John doesn’t.

BASIRA
Like, at all?

MELANIE
Yeah.

BASIRA
Yeah, that does explain some stuff. – wait, hang on, do I, do I know Georgie?

MELANIE
I don’t think so. Georgie Barker? She does “What the Ghost”.

BASIRA
No way. I used to love that show. I mean, the first couple of seasons, at least. Took a weird turn in season three, when they introduced –

MELANIE
Well, she and John, they, dated…

BASIRA
Yeah.

MELANIE
I mean, it was years ago…

BASIRA
Huh. I always used to put on podcasts, when I was driving around, you know, when I wasn’t on duty. I mean, when Daisy didn’t need the radio.

MELANIE
[laughing] I literally cannot picture Daisy listening to the radio!

BASIRA
The Archers.

MELANIE
No. [laughing]

BASIRA
Hands of God.

MELANIE
I actually do not believe you!

BASIRA
She never missed an episode.

[LOUD EXHALATION]
BASIRA
Oh, sorry, do you need to finish up?

MELANIE
No… I, I actually, I have no idea what I was going to say. I did have more notes on, um, on space, I guess, but, uh… forget it. Let’s go.

BASIRA
Alright, well, I should probably go check in with Martin, you know. See if he’s in for drinks.

MELANIE
So you can double-check your gossip.

BASIRA
I don’t gossip! I have the mind of an investigator.

MELANIE
Right, okay. Anyway, I’ll go find him. I could really do with the walk. Do you want to go ahead, and grab the booth?

BASIRA
Yeah, sure. I can wait. I’ve got a book.

MELANIE
Of course you do.

ELIAS
Come in, Melanie.

MELANIE
Martin said you wanted to see me?

[DOOR CLOSING]
ELIAS
Yes, please come in. I thought it was about time for your first performance review.

[MELANIE LAUGHS]
MELANIE
I, um, I didn’t even know that was a… well, there wasn’t anything scheduled.

ELIAS
No. Well, given the recent, um, tensions in the office –

MELANIE
[Heh]

ELIAS
– I thought it probably best if you weren’t aware of it in advance.

MELANIE
Right.

ELIAS
Less time to prepare, you understand.

MELANIE
Right.

ELIAS
So. Have a seat.

You’ve been with us a few months now, I believe.

MELANIE
Yes.

ELIAS
And how are you finding it?

MELANIE
Is that a joke?

ELIAS
Aside from the obvious, I mean.

MELANIE
Oh, well. I, I suppose it’s been… unstructured… Without John around, and with you being sat up here lurking, there’s not been a lot of useful direction.

ELIAS
I see.

MELANIE
I mean, you pick out a statement occasionally, and John might phone in to ask after some scrap of information. But to be honest, no one’s even really told me what an “archival assistant” is actually supposed to do.

ELIAS
So how have you been occupying your time?

MELANIE
[annoyed exhalation] Reading, mostly. Doing some of my own research.

ELIAS
Into what?

MELANIE
My own projects.

ELIAS
Of course. And plotting my demise.

MELANIE
When I get a chance, yes.

ELIAS
Hm.

MELANIE
I suppose that doesn’t look very good on my review.

ELIAS
Quite frankly, no.

MELANIE
Well, if you need to fire me, I won’t make a scene.

ELIAS
No. No, I’m afraid not.

MELANIE
Sure. [sigh]

ELIAS
I wish I knew the words that would make you believe me.

MELANIE
What? That you are a literal deadman switch? [muttering] For goodness sake…

[MELANIE LAUGHS AND INTERJECTS IMPATIENTLY OVER ELIAS AS HE MONOLOGUES AT HER]
ELIAS
You know, if that was the only issue, I could have simply placed the knowledge in your mind.

MELANIE
What!?

ELIAS
You already have doubts, though. You’ve been talking with Tim, and have convinced yourself that –

[MELANIE LAUGHS]
ELIAS
– even if I’m telling the truth, I’m too dangerous to live.

MELANIE
Well.

ELIAS
Whatever I’m planning needs to be stopped –

[MELANIE LAUGHS]
ELIAS
– even if it cost a few lives. Including your own.

MELANIE
Well, that’s not even –

ELIAS
A rationalization, of course. A lie about your own selfishness: that you would rather be dead than trapped without the self-determination you prize so highly. I wish I knew the words to convince you it’s for the best.

[PAUSE]
MELANIE
Are we done?

[ELIAS RESUMES MONOLOGUING, MELANIE RESUMES MAKING EXASPERATED NOISES OVER HIM]
ELIAS
It’s too deep. I can see almost anything I care to –

MELANIE
[muttering] Christ.

ELIAS
– retrieve knowledge from someone’s mind, or place it there. But I just cannot change the nature of a person. And I am struggling to think of what could rid you of this misguided rage.

MELANIE
So let me go! Or, kill me!

ELIAS
You know, that is the second such ultimatum I’ve heard in as many weeks. But no. There are always other options. And I am not above threats.

MELANIE
Threaten, then. I’ve got nothing.

ELIAS
That’s… almost true. Your life is indeed shockingly absent of any meaningful connections. That’s actually one of the reasons I chose you for this job.

Your father was your last real anchor, wasn’t he?

MELANIE
That’s none of your business.

ELIAS
Perhaps. Five years is plenty of time to grieve. It’s a real tragedy, isn’t it. Dementia? Especially so early. But he always remembered you, didn’t he? “Little moth.”

MELANIE
Shut up.

ELIAS
At least you got him into a decent care home. Hard to afford on an irregular income like yours, but your mother’s life insurance helped plenty.

[MELANIE IS BREATHING HARD, POSSIBLY REPRESSING TEARS]
And Ivy Meadows wasn’t as expensive as some of them. It’s a shame about the fire. But I would have thought it would offer something of a relief.

MELANIE
What are you talking about?

ELIAS
Oh. Of course. They told you he died in his sleep, didn’t they? Smoke inhalation. A real tragedy, but at least he didn’t suffer.

MELANIE
I –

ELIAS
Do you want to know what really killed him?

[MELANIE GASPS AND SOBS]
[ELIAS CONTINUES HIS MONOLOGUE, SPEAKING OVER AS MELANIE AS SHE CRIES]
ELIAS
Awful, isn’t it? He really suffered. Not really your fault. Just bad luck. That doesn’t comfort you, does it?

MELANIE
[crying] Take it back, take, take it back…

ELIAS
I’m afraid that’s not really something I can do. I can promise not to make it worse though.

MELANIE
What… no…

ELIAS
You know how your father really died. And I am sure that is unimaginably painful for you. But be aware: if I choose to, I can make you see it.

MELANIE
No… no, no…

ELIAS
If you try to interfere with me again in any way, I will drive that image so deep into your psyche that even if you are right – even if you live – it will be there every time you close your eyes.

[ELIAS FINISHES MONOLOGUING AND PAUSES; MELANIE CONTINUES TO CRY]
ELIAS
[normal voice] That’s alright. Take your time. Tell you what, why don’t you take the rest of the day off? I’m sure you have a lot to process.

Anyway, aside from all of that, I’d say your performance has been satisfactory.

[BACKGROUND NOISE OF CROWDED AIRPORT]
ARCHIVIST
I’ve, uh, just touched her in O’Hare International Airport, following up on the address I received from Xiaoling.

Apparently they were staying in West Pullman, Chicago. At least, they were when Gertrude requested the statements forwarded on to them. I’m going to get a hotel and follow up the address tomorrow.

I wouldn’t normally bother recording here, but I think… I thought I was being followed.

(sigh) I might just be jumpy. I’ll keep my eyes peeled.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
ARCHIVIST
The address didn’t really pan out. The place deals in short-term rentals, and a dozen people must have gone through that apartment since Gertrude and Gerard stayed there.

The owner did remember her – “that old Brit and her son” – but he said anything they left behind was either sold or thrown out. They did leave a forwarding address, of sorts: anything that came was to be sent on to the Usher Foundation in Washington, DC. Who, I assume, would send it on to the Magnus Institute.

I asked him about circuses around at the time, and he said he didn’t remember there being one, but a few nights while Gertrude was there, he had heard music – “like one of those little organs” – coming from West Pullman Park.

I’m planning to make the journey down to Washington in the hopes that Gertrude might have visited the Usher Foundation. According to our earlier emails, they don’t have any record of it on file, but… (sigh)

I did notice however the one of the Greyhound routes there goes through Pittsburgh. Now, according to the details Melanie retrieved a few months back, Pittsburgh is where Gerard Keay allegedly died. He was admitted to UPMC Presbyterian emergency department having suffered a massive seizure, and died less than a day later. I think I might have to pay a visit and ask around.

…

(sigh) Also, I’m definitely being followed.

There’s a police officer, I saw him at the airport as well, he stood out a bit because he wasn’t immigration, or TSA or anything like that. He just, he just looked like a Chicago beat cop.

Well, I saw him again today. And I’m pretty sure he was watching me.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
ARCHIVIST
(hoarsely, wheezing intermittently) The, the hospital was, the hospital was interesting. It’s all very well being able to get people to answer your questions, but if they genuinely don’t remember something, it’s not always as useful as it seems.

I only found one person, Louis Brown, a nurse, who recalls working the night Gerard Keay was admitted. His “mother” was with him – and I almost feel like Gertrude took a perverse joy in the pretense – she explained his condition to the doctor, though could apparently offer no good reason he wasn’t in full-time treatment, as his cancer was by this point… very advanced. (sigh) They did everything they could to save him, but he had a second seizure shortly after he was admitted, and there was nothing they could do.

Unless he was somehow able to lie to me this nurse, Louis, honestly believes Gerard Keay is dead. (sigh) Maybe I came all this way for nothing.

…

There’s one thing I very much do need to follow up on, though. Apparently Gertrude was arrested shortly afterwards. Louis only heard about this secondhand, but she was… apparently… caught breaking into the morgue… where Gerard’s body was being kept…

I need some sleep.

I haven’t seen a cop since I left Chicago, so maybe I was wrong.

…

I’m not feeling so good.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
ARCHIVIST
(hoarse, sluggish- and vague-sounding) I’ve been looking into Gertrude’s arrest. I couldn’t get through to Melanie, but Martin managed to find a few details online.

Gertrude was arrested for trespassing, but released shortly afterwards without being charged. I managed to track down the arresting officer, one Jay Rebecks, who said that she’d been found over the body of Gerard Keay reading from a large, strangely-shaped book.

They’d been unable to determine if the mutilations on Gerard’s body had been done by her, and in the end she somehow managed to talk them out of pressing charges.

Officer Rebecks didn’t remember what she’d said, but he did recall that she’d never returned for the book. It was sitting in evidence for almost a year before, as far as Rebecks was aware, it simply vanished.

I, I don’t really know what to make of any of this. I’m, uh, I’m confused, I’m, I’m dizzy, I, I think I saw the police officer from Chicago again, in the station where I was talking to Rebecks.

I…

I’m not… feeling well…

ARCHIVIST
(very hoarse) Elias has, um…

I, I, got a letter, well, an envelope… it’s, it’s a statement. There’s, there’s a note, “to tide you over,” and, uh…

…

Statement of Howard Ewing, regarding his interview with an unidentified member of British Transport Police. Original statement given February 1st, 2010. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The room is hot. It’s small and there are no windows, and the table is sheet metal. It shouldn’t be so hot in January, but I think maybe they’ve just got the heating turned up too high. When I rest my arm on the table too long, I can see the patches of sweat on the smooth surface as I lift them up again. I’ve asked for water so many times, and he always says it’s coming, but it hasn’t come yet.

He just sits there. He’s wearing the uniform of the British Transport Police. Three pips on his shoulder, but he won’t show me his badge, he won’t show me any ID.

Why are they doing this? I didn’t do anything. The officers that brought me here were friendly, kind. It was only after they left and it got so hot and he started sitting across from me.

He’s smiling, asking me questions again and again.

“What were you doing earlier tonight?”

My job, I was doing my job. Cleaning Moorgate Station. Me and Kelly and Vihan were the night cleaners and that’s what we were doing. We’d done the ticket office and the corridors and the entrances and we were getting started on the platforms. Why is that so hard for him to understand?

He laughs, and I wince as sweat drops into my eye.

“When did you first notice something was wrong?”

We had just started work on the platform itself when we heard the tannoy come on. I don’t know how. As far as I kne, it wasn’t even powered. But there was that slight crackle and then: “this is a security announcement”

We all waited, confused, but what came out next sounded muffled, like it was coming up through five feet of water. I couldn’t make out any of the words, and from the looks on their faces, neither could my colleagues. We strained to listen, but after a few seconds it was silent again.

We all looked at each other and Vihan started to shrug when there came an incredible shrieking noise from the speakers. It felt like needles through my eardrums, and it was all I could do to stay upright. I saw Kelly fall to the floor clutching her head.

Then it stopped completely, and we all looked at each other again, catching our breath, trying to figure out who to report this to, and how.

“How did you become aware of the train?”

The first thing I noticed was the smell. Even before the noise or the heat, there was a sticky greasy smell in the air, like burning chemicals and spoiled bacon. I tried to figure out where it was coming from, and I realized it got stronger the closer to the tunnel mouth I moved. By the time I reached the end of the platform I was almost gagging.

The others looked like they had mostly recovered from the screeching tannoy, and were noticing my odd movements and came over to investigate themselves.

I saw Vihan pull a face as he approached, and I pointed weakly to the opening of the tunnel. I carefully climbed down onto the tracks and looked out into the dark that led to Old Street. That’s when I saw it.

“What did the carriage look like?”

It was hard to tell through the flames. They were all over it, curling and writhing and crawling through the crevices in the wreckage. It wasn’t intact, though. Parts of it were clearly crumpled and broken, and I saw shards of steel and glass embedded in the wall. It was lit by the dim red flames.

“What did it look like?”

There were people still inside. I could see them, arms and heads reaching out of broken windows and split metal, blackened and rendered almost unrecognizable by the fire and the heat, but they still moved and twitched and cried out in pain and terror, scratching at the edge of their burning metal tomb. But everything was choked and surrounded by a thick acrid black smoke that stunned my eyes and lungs, so nothing seemed the same from one moment to the next.

“What did it look like?”

It looked like hell.

“What did you hear?”

Everything. The tunnel echoed and funneled the sounds until I could hear every agonized cry, every pop and crackle of the fire, the groaning of metal that matched the groaning of the wounded and the dying, it all hit me at once, like the tunnel was pushing the tidal wave of sound out just for me. The shape was perfect for a terrible screaming oven.

From behind me I heard the shouts of Kelly and Rehan, though I don’t know if it was because they saw it, too, or because they saw me fall to my knees in horror.

I could hear the tannoy again, now clearly speaking: “Will Inspector Sands please report, will Inspector Sands please report,” over and over again.

He smiles, and the tiny room gets hotter.

“Who is Inspector Sands?”

It’s a code, one of the codes we use to alert staff to situations of disaster or fire. It usually means there’s a fire. It’s to keep people calm. It’s meant to not cause any panic, keep them safe, even if there’s an emergency.

He laughs, and I wish I could go home.

“How many people were on the train?”

I don’t know.

“What sort of train carriage was it?”

I don’t know.

“Where did it come from?”

I don’t know.

“Did you scream?”

Yes.

At least I think so. The back of my throat was dry and hot and painful, so my mouth must have been open. I think I was screaming.

“What were your colleagues doing?”

Vihan was gripping me by the shoulders, shaking me, yelling at me to wake up. But I was awake, I was wide awake, and I think in some ways he was talking to himself. Kelly was walking past me, trying to battle through the choking rancid smoke.

I hope she was planning to try and rescue those trapped in the wreckage, but maybe she was simply trying to join them.

I couldn’t do anything to help either of them, and I knew that if I touched them I would burn them.

He inhales as if in triumph.

“And where are they now?”

They’re dead.

At least that’s what I was told when the officers brought me here.

They found no wreckage, nothing in the tunnels, no corpses wailing through an underground inferno, just the dead and burnt bodies of Kelly Dwyer and Vihan Prasad.

“What do you love most in the world?”

The question sends a shock through my whole body. I know this is what he wants, all he truly cares about. I want to lie, to say that I love nothing and nobody, that I am alone in the world, and he’ll have to look elsewhere. My tongue burns in my mouth as I try to keep it still.

“What do you love most in the world?”

My father. I love my father more than anything.

“Who am I?”

I don’t answer, and he lets me leave.

My father is dead a week later.

A heart attack at the age of 63. Everyone is surprised and saddened, but not shocked. I try to tell myself it’s a coincidence, that a heart attack is the most natural death in the world, but at the funeral, despite arranging it myself, despite selecting the burial plot and the headstone, I watch as they take my father off for cremation, and nobody can tell me why. They simply say how sorry they are for my loss, and hand me my father’s ashes. I don’t want his ashes.

I know he’ll be back, the policeman with three bright pips on his shoulder.

And he’ll ask me what else I love. And I’ll tell him.

Then he’ll ask me who he is, and I won’t say.

I don’t want to cause any panic.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

…

(sigh) I’m going to bed.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
ARCHIVIST
I feel… a lot better.

I’d love to rattle off a list of potential other reasons for this – nice rational causes of recovery – but… I think we’re past the point of transparent rationalizations. It looks like the recording of statements has now passed over from psychological compulsion into a more physical dependence.

I don’t know whether this is some sort of classical addiction, or something a bit deeper. But either way, this is not the time for experimentation. I am on a deadline, and if I need to be reading statements to stay well enough, then I suppose that’s what I shall do.

What irritates me most is that Elias was clearly aware of this, hence his sending me this, which seems to serve no other purpose but as a restorative. But, as usual, he chose to keep this very useful information to himself.

I think I’ve reached another dead end here. I’ve decided it’s the last one. The Institute needs me there, not jetting around the world following a cold trail that may well not have led to anything useful the first time.

(sigh) I’ve a Greyhound booked down to Washington DC tomorrow. I’m going to stop in at the Usher Foundation, just in case they have anything that might help, and then I’m flying home.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
ARCHIVIST
I’m at a rest stop. The, uh, the buses, they’re, they’re giving us a comfort break, but there’s, there’s a woman here in the cafe, the diner, whatever. I’ve seen her car, I think she’s following the bus. She’s early 30s, I think, dressed nondescript: hard-wearing denim, old leather.

And she is… definitely watching me. She doesn’t look like – she’s coming over, I think –

Hello? Uhh, can I… help you?

WOMAN
Sure. Whatever you’re reaching for, don’t.

ARCHIVIST
I… what?

WOMAN
Keep your hands on the table, and we can all walk away from this.

So are you. Ah-ah! Hands on the table.

Who are you?

WOMAN
Julia. Who are you?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… uh, you don’t know me?

JULIA
Should I?

ARCHIVIST
No, I-I guess! Just, uh, I mean everyone normally seems to.

JULIA
Hm. Good for you.

ARCHIVIST
N-not really.

So, who are you?

Oh, uh, uh, Jonathan! – uh, John. Sims. Uh, I’m the Head Archivist for the Magnus Institute. London.

JULIA
Oh, you don’t say. So what brings you down to the I-70. Pennsylvania.

ARCHIVIST
Uh, look, I mean… you’re the one following me.

JULIA
We were told you were asking some interesting questions around a few places back in Pittsburgh. And you seem to have attracted the attention of something we’ve been watching for a while.

ARCHIVIST
…uh… my, my bus is leaving…

JULIA
Let it. You’re riding with me.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t think so.

JULIA
Then try to run.

Go on.

ARCHIVIST
So… kidnapped. Again.

JULIA
Think of it like… an escort. Personal bodyguard.

You’re heading to DC, right? Come on, we can chat in the car. I’m sure you’ve got a ton of librarian stories. The miles will just fly by.

ARCHIVIST
Do I have any choice?

JULIA
If you did you’d only make a mistake.

[ARCHIVIST SIGHS]
Come on.

[SOUNDS OF INSIDE OF MOVING CAR]
ARCHIVIST
…are you alright? You seem, uh…

JULIA
Sure. Just keeping an eye out. Waiting, you know.

…

So you’re from the Magnus Institute?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, yes. You, you know the Institute…?

JULIA
Oh, yeah. Checked myself in there a while back. Ended up spilling my guts to this old woman about my dad. Just, letting it all out.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, uh, that would be Gertrude. My, my predecessor.

JULIA
Didn’t catch her name.

Weirdest thing, really. Didn’t mean to spill half of it, but… really helped me put the pieces together. You know?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, I’m starting to.

JULIA
Hm.

You still haven’t told me what you’re doing this side of the pond. Or why you’re asking around about Gerard Keay.

ARCHIVIST
Uh (nervous laugh)… would you… believe me if I said I was trying to save the world?

JULIA
Probably not.

ARCHIVIST
…

What about you?

What brings the daughter of Robert Montauk all the way out here? And why, exactly are you –

Can I see some ID, please?

POLICE OFFICER
Of course… you British?

JULIA
I have my green card, Officer… Mustermann.

MUSTERMANN
And your friend?

JULIA
Visiting from home!

ARCHIVIST
Julia…

MUSTERMANN
Does he have his passport on him?

ARCHIVIST
Julia.

JULIA
I assume so. Can’t say I asked him – John.

ARCHIVIST
J-J-Julia, I-I don’t, I don’t think – ah…

MUSTERMANN
Step out of the car, please, sir.

JULIA
Now, hang on a second.

MUSTERMANN
Step out. Of the car.

[TWO METALLIC CLUNKING SOUNDS]
MUSTERMANN
Pop the trunk, ma’am.

JULIA
I mean, there’s nothing in there.

MUSTERMANN
I’m not gonna ask you again.

Fine.

Oh, bloody hell, Jule. You said you’d stop after a couple of miles. Been near on an hour.

Ohhh, look at my neck, it don’t feel right…

JULIA
Oh, you knew it might take a while.

MAN
This him, then?

JULIA
It is. John, Trevor.

ARCHIVIST
Uh – T-Trevor Herbert, the, the Vampire Killer!

TREVOR
Julia…

JULIA
He works for the Magnus Institute. He’s read all about us.

TREVOR
Oh. Well, isn’t that something.

JULIA
My thoughts exactly.

TREVOR
Time for that later. You two help me now, this one needs its head off.

JULIA
You didn’t kill it?!

TREVOR
We don’t know what it is yet, do we?

JULIA
Ugh!

ARCHIVIST
What, the, the, the police officer? I think I have an idea.

TREVOR
Oh-ho! Do you now. Then you get the axe. It’s in the boot.

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I, I don’t…

MARTIN
Martin Blackwood, archival assistant at the Magnus Institute recording statement number 0092008. Statement of Adonis Biros, given August 20th, 2009.

Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
It’s been so hot recently, that sticky sort of hot you only really get in the city. On the beach, watching the clear blue waters swell and recede, it would be wonderful to simply sit, still and alone; to experience it. But in the city there is no stillness, no privacy. The swell is that of rank, sweaty humanity , and to press through them is to work the dirt and dust that infuses the air into your own skin. The stink is deeper than just a simple smell.

I suppose I’m lucky that my work rarely takes me out during the middle of the day. I am an actor by trade, and both skilled and fortunate enough to find myself employed more often than not. I’m not sure I would say I enjoy it, necessarily, but I do find a certain fulfillment in it

I remember the first time I felt the calling. I was nine years old, visiting my grandparents in Athens, and my parents had taken me on a trip to see the great amphitheatre. It was winter, not the season for tourists. My parents were off in a corner somewhere arguing, but just for a moment I had the place entirely to myself. And I felt it: that strange centering, that spot at the core of everything where you and you alone speak. Your words heard by no one – and in that no one, the entire universe.

Yes, I am aware that normally there is – unless something has gone badly wrong – an audience, or at the very least other actors with which to trade dialogue. And that’s fine. But that is not what I live for. I live for the monologue: when all others fade away and the light tightens on me, excluding all else.

Have you ever had stage lights in your eyes? The brightness steals everything else, and if it’s strong enough, you can look out into the audience and see nothing at all. Just you.

I am a fine actor, and a very capable physical performer, but these are simply the dues I pay to earn my way to a monologue. For the last two weeks, I have been performing the part of Jaques in As You Like It. Do you know your Shakespeare?

Well, it’s not the greatest production of the play, which can be very funny if done right. The director, a man named David Austin, has neither the vision nor the spark to turn it into something truly memorable, and the reviews reflect that. I don’t care, though. That’s not why I do it. You see, there is one part of as you like it that almost every English-speaking person will know, and that is a monologue by Jaques:

“All the world’s a stage,

And all the men and women on it merely players:

They have their exits and their entrances;

And one man in his time plays many parts,

His acts being seven ages.”

I told you you’d know it. And for all his failings Mr. David Austin made one directorial decision for which I cannot praise him enough: during this soliloquy, he has the other actors in the scene walk upstage, beyond the lights, and has me delivering the lines out into the audience alone.

For the play, it’s a bad decision: that scene is supposed to be Jaques performing, joking, for the amusement of the Duke and his friends, so this staging makes something that should be light and energetic into a serious and soulful meditation, and it doesn’t work from a dramatic point of view. But for me, declaiming, casting my voice out, surrounded by people watching me, yet completely alone… I have rarely had a part that feeds my soul like this one.

It helps that we’re performing at the Duke’s Theatre in Covent Garden: it’s about as traditional a theatre as you’re likely to find, and when the light shines, the audience is rendered as mere silhouettes, completely anonymous.

At least, until four nights ago.

It was my big moment: Act 2, Scene 7. The others had vanished, the audience was gone, and it was just me. At least, at first. I remember it was as I began to talk about “the justice,” the fifth age of man, that I saw it. It was a mask, a theatre mask. Not one of the happy-sad ones you might associate with the stage, but like an old Greek chorus mask, neutral with a faint aspect of mourning about the mouth and eyes. It sat on top of a thick black cloak draped to completely cover whoever might be wearing the mask.

But I knew it was empty. It was a hollow shape of a man that had no life, no presence to it. And I saw it in the middle of the third row as clearly as if it were lit by a second spotlight.

I stumbled. Of course I stumbled. I don’t believe anyone in the actual audience really noticed, though the other actors offered their faux-sympathies over it afterwards. I did make it to the end, and pushed on through the rest of the performance, but the mask did not disappear, and watching the other actors quickly convinced me that either they did not notice the thing in the third row, or they simply could not see it.

Oddly, I’ve never feared for my sanity. I’ve always been… superstitious, and I had no doubt that what I had seen was some sort of spectre or omen. Of what, however, I had absolutely no idea. To be perfectly honest, I still don’t. This is one of the reasons I am here: because I have this deep and gnawing fear that it portends nothing but itself, and within that, there is some strangely aweful fate waiting for me.

I have never been quite as social as I am told an actor should be. Rehearsals have always been a professional thing for me, and have rarely resulted in friendships, and I actively avoid after-show drinks. It will perhaps not surprise you to discover I instead prefer to walk the city, to find those streets and places where the night crowd does not gather, and wander those empty lights, clearing my head as I leave the heat and cloying conversation behind. In the summer months, this ritual is almost a necessity for me to remain stable, my steps taking me through the echoing streets and artificial lights, an edifice to humanity uncluttered by the messy existence of actual people.

The mask and cloak did not appear at the theater the following night. I looked for it, yet saw nothing but an audience of silhouettes, quiet and intent, save for when applause was required.

It wasn’t my best performance, on edge as I was, but I got through it. Afterward, Patrick Dunlevy, who played Orlando, was more insistent than usual that I join them for drinks after the show, and it took all my composure to keep my excuses polite, as the sticky heat of his presence pressed through over the fading warmth of the stage lights and the high summer that pervaded even the Duke of York.

But I did escape him, and fled into the cooling dampness of the city streets by night. Streets which I knew were less likely to be populated were mercifully deserted, and the windows of the buildings either side were lit, but empty of anybody visible. My breathing began to slow, my steps became more sure, and the oppressive thickness of the air lessened just enough for me to relax.

I began to look up at all the darkened windows above street level. It’s a strange truth to realize that, for all the throng of humanity that exists in central London, almost nobody actually lives there. All the apartments and residences that sit above the bustling shopfronts and businesses are almost all empty. Bought as investments by the financiers and oligarchs who have no desire or need to live in them. If you raise your eyes upwards in central London, and count the lit windows, it’s not at all unusual to see none at all.

But that night, as I caught my breath and raised my head, there was a lit window on the second floor, and within it, a masked mockery of a human figure. My face fell, until I had the odd certainty that my expression matched that of my pursuer, and panic began to settle over my brain, pinprick-crawling from the back, inch by inch over my skull. And I knew that when it reached my eyes I would run.

The figure didn’t move. Of course it didn’t, there was nothing to it that could move – no will that could make it follow me. And yet, it still watched, its hollow empty eyes drawing me into it.

I ran for some time, through streets I knew should be humming with drunks and nighthawks and insomniacs, but they were all silent. I was alone. Sometimes when I turned a corner, at the far end I could see it, waiting for me, and I would turn away. Sometimes, when I looked over my shoulder, I would see it there, following me with its stillness, its absence.

Once I looked up, and the windows were full of it.

I don’t know how long I ran, but in the end I fell, physically spent, and sunken in despair. Raising my head, I saw it before me, waiting. So I stood, and began to walk slowly towards it.

It gave no reaction, simply awaiting my arrival. As I got closer, I saw it more clearly: the heavy weave of the black woolen cloak; the shining porcelain of the mask; the hollow, empty space behind the eyes, inside the mouth. I faced my demon, and there was nothing there.

In a fit of sudden rage, I struck out, my arm catching it on the side of what should have been a head. But the cloth crumpled beneath my blow, the mask fell, and the figure collapsed into a heap. Inside was a simple wooden stick, once propping the thing up, but now fallen to the ground and lying motionless.

I went home quickly, my eyes downcast and furtive, and went to bed. I only once looked out of my window at the street below.

I don’t think it’s going to stop. Last night was the worst yet. I knew they were coming, but how do you prepare for something like that? The first was there in the audience before I even set foot on the stage. By my second entrance, there were five that I could count. And when I began my monologue, the whole auditorium was full of masks.

All the world’s a stage, and it was empty – my only company, the mocking grotesques of pantomimed humanity. The mewling infant, the schoolboy, the lover, the soldier, the judge, each eliciting such a roar of nothing from them it took my breath away.

Perhaps I should have stopped: fled the stage, quit acting entirely. But it was like a lonely avalanche, and it flowed out of me in a wave. And I reached oblivion. An absence of applause that nearly deafened me. Sans everything.

After the show, David came up to me. He wore his best director’s smile, and made as to shake my hand. His mouth moved telling me how much this performance had meant to him, how right the energy had been, and how whatever I had tapped into within myself, I should reach for it again at the next performance.

I tried to listen, to nod, but his eyes were hollow, and I knew that he wasn’t really there.

I have another performance tonight. In less than four hours, I will be on that stage again, speaking those empty lines to emptier ears.

I could run, of course, but I won’t. Where would I run to? All the world’s a stage, and I can’t escape my monologue.

MARTIN
Statement ends.

(exhale) That wasn’t so bad… (inhale) I’m… not sure there is anything to say about this one. John’s got us looking into anything that might involve theatres or the circus, but to be honest, I don’t think this is really what he’s looking for. The strangers here seem… er, different, I guess? It doesn’t have any clowns, or dancing, or… skin.

I wanted to ask Tim about it, but he hasn’t been around much the last week or so. Says he’s working on something, which is… I mean, it could be fine? I guess? He’s just… quite… intense at the moment… He – scares me sometimes.

Truth be told, none of us are doing great, but it’s actually Melanie who seems – I don’t know, something’s happened, I think. Her work’s been kind of… off lately, and any time I talk to her, she just finds some reason to leave. I asked her to look into what happened to Adonis Biros, the actor from the statement, and she hasn’t bothered, as far as I can tell.

John called. He’s in America now, wanted her to help with something, but I had to make an excuse for her. He, he doesn’t need that kind of thing on his mind right now…

I just hope he gets back soon.

…You know, saying it out loud, I, I think I’m actually really worried about Melanie. I – (sigh) you know what, Basira knows her better than. I’ve (laugh) been too awkward to ask, but I need to. I really think I need to –

(calling out in the hall) Basira?

…Melanie?

…Tim…?

PETER
Martin, isn’t it?

MARTIN
(gasp) D-don’t move! And, don’t you come any closer, okay?! I’ve got a, I’ve got a knife!

PETER
Do you? That would seem wildly out-of-character, from what I’ve been told.

MARTIN
Okay, but – okay, stay back!

PETER
Please, Martin, I’m not going to hurt you. I just thought we might have a chat.

Alone.

MARTIN
Oh. You’re… one of them, aren’t you? A, a Lukas.

PETER
Yes, that’s – Peter, pleased to meet you! Now, how did you know that?

MARTIN
I, I was just, reading? John left some notes, and –

PETER
I see. I’m sorry to have disturbed you.

It’s one of Elias’s little jokes.

MARTIN
I don’t – what?!

PETER
Did he suggest you record a statement today? One that mentioned me?

MARTIN
Yeah? Sort of – I mean, you know, not you specifically, but –

PETER
I have a meeting with him today. He suggested it. I’m sure he’s watching from his office, grinning from ear to ear.

MARTIN
I… don’t…

PETER
I almost thought he genuinely wanted me to meet the team. Ah, well.

MARTIN
I’m really sorry – I-I don’t actually – ahaha –

PETER
Do I scare you, Martin?

MARTIN
Yes!

PETER
Hmm. Probably for the best. And what’s Elias like to work for? Aside from orchestrating unsettling encounters? (laugh)

MARTIN
That’s… that’s a lot of it, to be honest.

PETER
And that’s not something you look for in an employer, I assume?

MARTIN
Well, he’s… I mean, you just… you’ve just said he’s watching us.

PETER
Almost certainly.

How is he as a boss?

MARTIN
Fine, I guess? I mean, not so much with the manipulation, and… sometimes… the murder?

PETER
Oh! That doesn’t sound like the Elias I know. He killed people himself?

MARTIN
I mean I wasn’t, I wasn’t there, but that’s what he said? And I did see the body. Bodies.

PETER
Elias Bouchard, getting his hands dirty… ah, well. Must be the end times.

MARTIN
Don’t…

PETER
So, your advice would be less murder?

MARTIN
I… suppose!?

PETER
No, no, it’s a good observation, I thank you for it.

MARTIN
You’re wel…come…

PETER
Well, I’m sure I’ve disturbed you quite enough for one day. Martin, I have a meeting to get to and a few things to tell Elias to his face about wasting both our time. Be seeing you! As it were.

[DOOR OPENS]
[SQUEALING STATIC FADES OUT]
MARTIN
Y-yeah! Bye?

[DOOR CLOSES]
MARTIN
…what?!

BASIRA
Did you call me?

MARTIN
Yeah! Um… did you see anyone?

BASIRA
When?

MARTIN
Out there, just now?

BASIRA
Um, no…?

MARTIN
No?

BASIRA
No.

MARTIN
(sigh) That figures.

BASIRA
So, did you need anything, or…?

MARTIN
Does the name Peter Lukas mean anything to you?

BASIRA
Oh! Yes, actually. I’ve been reading a bunch of old statements, he’s that creepy old boat captain, right? From the family Elias doesn’t want us bothering.

MARTIN
Yeah, well, apparently that warning doesn’t go both ways.

BASIRA
He was here?

MARTIN
Yeah. I, I mean, I think, I think so…?

BASIRA
Was he… woOoOo?

MARTIN
I mean, a bit, yeah.

BASIRA
Oh. Oh, dear.

MARTIN
Mmmmaybe? I don’t know, honestly, he was just a bit… weeeeird.

BASIRA
Yeah. Is that why you wanted me?

MARTIN
Oh, no, like – you busy?

BASIRA
A bit. I was reading through a bunch of stuff about the Church of the Divine Host…?

[AS BASIRA SPEAKS, MARTIN CONTINUOUSLY MAKES FRUSTRATED LITTLE NOISES IN AN EFFORT TO INDICATE THAT HE DOES NOT WANT TO DISCUSS THIS RIGHT NOW]
Did you look into that statement about the chapel in Hither Green? Because apparently, right around that time, there was a full solar eclipse going on in – guess where…?

MARTIN
I don’t know.

BASIRA
Ny-Ålesund! And when Natalie Ennis talked about it being 300 years ago – well! How much do you know about the relationship between Edmond Halley and John Flamsteed?

MARTIN
What – Halley like the comet?

BASIRA
Exactly.

MARTIN
Look, Basira, that’s really interesting but that’s not why – uh, uh, you’re close to Melanie, right?

BASIRA
Um, I guess so? Closer than anyone here, I think.

MARTIN
Is she, she doing okay?

BASIRA
Why? Did she… say something?

MARTIN
No… no, it’s just her work’s been… look, she’s always been quite, you know, conscientious, but then recently, everything’s –

BASIRA
Okay, look. I don’t know what the situation is, she won’t tell me, but she’s not doing well. We were meant to go for a drink last week, but… I think it has something to do Elias.

MARTIN
Elias. Oh, god…

BASIRA
Yeah.

MARTIN
Well, well, maybe we can – what?

Oh. Right.

[CLICK; MARTIN SWITCHES OFF THE TAPE RECORDER]

ARCHIVIST
Well?

TREVOR
She said you could turn it on. Didn’t say anything about talking.

ARCHIVIST
Look, we, we’re on the same side –

JULIA
If you’re telling the truth.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I don’t know what proof I can give you.

JULIA
Uh, well, if you’re right about it, it won’t be long until Officer Mustermann over here is able to talk again. That should be illuminating.

TREVOR
He’s almost got his lungs again! If you can call them lungs.

JULIA
Eh, as long as they can push air, they’ll do.

ARCHIVIST
Uh, and, if you don’t like what he has to say…?

JULIA
Then this cabin is a long way away from anything that can hear you.

[JULIA AND TREVOR LAUGH]
ARCHIVIST
And, and, and if I run?

TREVOR
I’m very much hoping that you do.

[JULIA AND TREVOR LAUGH AGAIN]
ARCHIVIST
I read your statement, you know, you, you don’t kill people. Only monsters.

TREVOR
The line gets blurrier every day.

ARCHIVIST
What about you, Julia? Following in your dad’s footsteps?

JULIA
It’s a legacy I’ve learned to be proud of. (heh) There are people who’d sell us all out to things you can’t even imagine. I’m happy doing what it takes to stop that.

ARCHIVIST
Murder?

JULIA
Why not? Everything dies. You think if you walk out of this cabin, you just keep going ? Something gets you, even if it’s just time.

Mostly, though life on this planet ends violently. It’s the most natural thing in the world; and sometimes, it makes the world a better place.

ARCHIVIST
And… when something comes for you?

JULIA
Mh. Then I die.

ARCHIVIST
That, that doesn’t… scare you?

JULIA
Every second.

[SOUND OF “OFFICER MUSTERMANN” BREATHING THROUGH PARTIALLY-REGROWN LUNGS]
ARCHIVIST
Can, can we keep that somewhere else…?

TREVOR
I want it where I can see it.

ARCHIVIST
And when you’re satisfied that I’m not trying to harm you?

TREVOR
If you’re right about that ritual, I guess, you talk to Gerard.

ARCHIVIST
You said he was dead…

JULIA
(spooky voice) He is.

TREVOR
(laugh)

ARCHIVIST
…r-right…

So we just… wait.

JULIA
That’s the plan.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

…

[FURTHER LUNG-REGROWTH SOUNDS]
ARCHIVIST
Look – perhaps if, all we can do is listen to this… r-regrowing itself, may I suggest a way to pass the time?

JULIA
Sure. You want our story?

TREVOR
Gave you folks plenty already.

ARCHIVIST
I, I mean, yes… but the situation has changed quite a bit…? Last I heard, you were dying of lung cancer.

TREVOR
I was.

ARCHIVIST
And now…?

TREVOR
I’m not. (heh)

ARCHIVIST
And that doesn’t strike you as… odd.

TREVOR
Not much I see these days isn’t “odd” somehow or other. Not gonna turn my nose up at one bit of it worked out well for me. I hunt monsters; my lungs don’t kill me. Seems like a fair trade. No big job, is it.

ARCHIVIST
Wh-what about you, Julia? Care, care to make a statement? Maybe about how you met Trevor?

JULIA
Sure, why not.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

JULIA
It’s not like you or your tape recorder get to leave here without us.

ARCHIVIST
(clears throat) Statement of Julia Montauk, regarding her initial encounter with the hunter, Trevor Herbert.

Uh, when did this happen?

JULIA
About six years ago?

TREVOR
Seven! 2010.

JULIA
Sure. Summer 2010.

ARCHIVIST
Statement taken direct from subject June 29th, 2017.

Statement begins.

JULIA (STATEMENT)
I tried to live a normal life. I really did. I took jobs working in the backroom of offices where I wouldn’t need to meet anyone. I had boyfriends who promised they didn’t care. I burned through half a dozen counselors. None of it worked.

You see, my father’s always remained one of the darlings of the true crime community. Articles, documentaries, grisly retrospectives: wherever I ended up, somehow it would always worm its way into my life. One of my co-workers or new friends would stumble across a profile of my father, and that would be that. Every time I ended up in a relationship, it was only a matter of time before I caught them on some true crime blog, or spotted a profile of my father in their search history.

Sometimes, I tried to lie about it, so there was no relation, but the damage was done. They’d get distant, throw me nervous glances when they didn’t think I’d notice. Or worse, they started to look at me like I was some sort of prize, some small claim to fame: the serial killer’s daughter.

I suppose I could have changed my name. Um, something always stopped me though: it was the only connection I still had to my dad, and even if it did keep ruining my life, I couldn’t bring myself to lose it.

The counselors and the therapists were more understanding… but even they couldn’t quite keep the eager quiver out of their voice when I started talking about the murders. It felt like every couple of years, I was having to start my life over from scratch.

What is it, do you think, that makes people so obsessed with horrific things happening to other people? Even now, after all I’ve done, I can’t quite figure out what it is that makes people treat actual atrocities like cheap entertainment.

Maybe we’re all just broken inside, unable to really grasp the difference between fictional people, and people we just don’t know. They’re all just abstract ideas we’re happy to have suffer for our enjoyment.

Or… maybe the fact it really happened is exactly the point, adding the awful spice of reality to people’s morbid fantasies.

When I think of the lurid joy some people would feel if I were caught – the serial killer’s daughter taking over the family business – it makes me sick. But even back then, with my hands unbloodied, that collective obsession with brutality chased me throughout my life.

In the summer of 2010, I made another attempt to outrun my father’s legacy, and moved up to Manchester to take a new job. It was night shift work, security and maintenance for an old office building, occupied by a handful of failing companies trying to save money on floor space.

I liked it because I didn’t really have to talk to anyone. I was on the desk alone, and generally anyone working there late enough to cross paths with me wasn’t in a talking mood.

There was another reason that I chose to work nights. If you read my statement, then I’m sure it will come as no surprise that for most of my life, I’ve had a pretty significant fear of the dark. I used to lie awake at night… listening, straining my ears for the noise of movement, or that dreadful growl coming out of the dark.

It was one of my better counselors that suggested I try working nights as a way to address it. And it worked. For the most part. It made the darkness mundane, just another aspect of my everyday life to be dealt with, and kept me within the comforting glow of lamps and light bulbs basically all the time. It also let me sleep during the day, when the faintest hint of sunlight that crept around the edges of my thick bedroom curtains made me feel safe enough to relax. It made dating even harder, of course, but by that point I’d mostly given up trying. It wasn’t a perfect solution, by any means, but it helped. To start with, at least.

I never really worried about keeping track of the companies that kept offices in my building. It seemed like that came and went pretty regularly. Sometimes a start-up would make it big, but usually it was the inevitable bankruptcy that moved them out.

All except DKN Systems. I never really figured out what it was they were meant to be doing. Something full of meaningless buzzwords, like “business networks” or “media solutions.” Thinking about it, it might actually have been “business media network solutions.” Point is, there didn’t seem to be anything suspicious about them. At least not at first.

I knew a bit more about them than the other people renting space, since they seemed to do a lot of work after dark, and there were a handful of their staff I knew on sight. I mean, I assumed they also did a lot of work in the daytime that I just wasn’t seeing. So it didn’t seem particularly weird. Just another small business burning the candle everywhere they could to stay afloat.

But even if the company itself didn’t seem weird, the people who worked for it really did. I remember there were four of them normally around, and at one point I thought it must have been a family thing, because I got it in my head that they were related. I don’t know why – they didn’t even look that similar – but there was just something about their faces. It was the eyes, I think. It looked like they all had irises so dark that they almost seemed completely black.

And they dressed the same. Not like a uniform, but they all wore black trousers, a dark blue shirt, and a brown leather belt. They also wore soft-soled black canvas shoes, which were almost completely silent when walking down the carpeted halls of the building.

It made them even more unsettling, quietly wandering the corridors, never quite looking where they were going, like their attention was focused on something you just couldn’t see.

There was only one of them that ever spoke, at least to me: a young guy called Vardhan Darvish. He seemed to be the manager, at least as much as there was any clear structure. And unlike his colleagues, he seemed happy, almost eager, to talk.

I asked him about it once, and he laughingly told me that his co-workers didn’t sign up for the quality of conversation. He’d chat with me about my job and the latest headline – which he always had a strong opinion about. We never discussed any details of his life, though, or his job. He generally came over to let me know about a blown light bulb somewhere in the building, and then stick around for a bit of conversation.

I once jokingly suggested he must be breaking the lights himself for an excuse to talk to me. And he laughed, but then got kind of quiet, and didn’t stick around to talk.

At the time, I assumed my awkward flirting had made it weird… but unfortunately not! (laugh)

TREVOR (STATEMENT)
Bulbs were breaking because of what they were doing around the offices.

I’d been tracking Darvish for a good few weeks by then. There’d been a couple of homeless I knew gone missing around Parrs Wood, where I were keeping back then. Now, usually I wouldn’t pay much mind – was the summer, after all – but there were a couple of ladies gone. So I checked in with shelters, and a worker that dealt with them, but no one had the first clue. I knew Morris had at least a kid with a woman down in Moss Side, so he wouldn’t’ve skipped down – but she hadn’t seen him neither.

My first thought were vampires, as they like to go after rough sleepers. But I knew, by then, there were other horrors kicking around – not to mention your mundane murderers.

Didn’t matter to me, of course! Not by then. I had a hunt on, and I was going to see it through. It weren’t long after I went down to see you folk, so I was still convinced I were on the way out. And caution weren’t something I cared for. (laugh)

Don’t recall exactly how Darvish got on my radar. Someone had seen something that sent me somewhere that led me to him, I don’t, I don’t know. Point is, soon as I saw him, I knew he were the one I were after. There was a smell to him: something dark and sick, rolling off him in waves. Sure, he didn’t smell like a vampire, but he smelt like something that weren’t meant to be in this world. So, I reckoned I best help him out of it.

Took to following him for a couple of days. Didn’t know exactly what he was, or what he wanted, so I weren’t keen to charge right in. He seemed normal at first, mind. Happy enough in the sun (heh), though he worked nights. That’s how I first saw him. Didn’t spot me – or if he did, he never paid me no mind. They never do.

Third night, I spotted him at work, taking a delivery. It were a big truck for some company called “Outer Bay.” I tried to follow them up since, but didn’t find much. Then again, maybe I didn’t know what I were looking for – I mean, to anyone else, the box they were unloading would have looked like nothing much.

But if there’s one thing I know, it’s what a box looks like when it’s got someone inside.

There’s a certain shape it tends to be, and the folk carrying it have to take a second to manage its shifting weight. Might have looked like a big old flight case, but as soon as I saw it, I was certain there was somebody inside. What I didn’t know was: alive? Or dead?

JULIA (STATEMENT)
Looking back, I feel like an idiot. I was watching them unload that same case. It was policy to have whoever was working security present for deliveries. Something about insurance. Thinking about it (sigh), I even noticed Trevor lurking past the fence – though I didn’t give much thought to just another tramp.

[TREVOR LAUGHS]
I had no idea what they had in the box, though. They told me it was new computer service, and I didn’t have any reason not to believe them. They’d had plenty of similar deliveries before.

Vardhan was there, and we talked for a while. He wanted to discuss the tennis, I think, but I’ve never really followed sport. He didn’t seem suspicious or weird, and I had no reason to think that this was anything other than a late delivery of normal computer parts.

They took the case up to their offices, and I returned to my desk with a fresh cup of coffee, and a plan to dig him for the night with some episodes of an old radio show I was working my way through. The plan went pretty smooth for an hour or two, with the exception of a couple of DKN employees silently shuffling past at unnerving moments.

Then I happened to glance up at one of the video feeds, and saw that the tramp I saw earlier had managed to sneak inside the building.

TREVOR (STATEMENT)
(snort) It weren’t as hard as all that! Didn’t even need to break a window or nothing – just waited until the last of the office weirdos were heading back inside. They were slow enough, it were pretty simple to tail them through before the door swung shut.

Once in, I had to look for cameras, because I knew there were a security guard. I’d seen her when they were unloading, and were pretty sure I could take her out, if I needed to –

JULIA
(laugh) In your dreams, old man.

TREVOR (STATEMENT)
– but I didn’t want it to come to that!

I tried to stay out of sight, but she must have spotted me, because soon enough I could hear her coming my way. I managed to duck into a stairwell and head up towards the fourth floor, where the front of the building said Darvish’s company was.

I could hear her behind me, though, so I ducked out a floor early and nipped inside a cleaning cupboard to wait her out.

JULIA (STATEMENT)
I went all the way to the fourth floor, not realizing that this git wasn’t up there. The corridor light was out, and I made a note to replace it later as I turned on my torch.

It was very quiet; far quieter than I would have expected for a company installing new equipment. I took a moment to get my bearings, and there was no sound at all. Utter silence, except for the faintest “drip, drip, drip” coming from somewhere up ahead. I called out, first for the trespasser, then for Vardhan, then for anybody who might be up there. But there was no answer.

My torch beam fell on the door labeled “DKN Systems.” It stood open, unmoving, with no light at all coming from inside. As my light crossed the doorframe, I could see the windows had been covered with thick wooden boards, and painted a dark matte black.

In the corner of my mind, I could feel panic starting to claw its way up, as the darkness started to press in on me. I called out again, but there was still no reply.

I wanted to turn around and run back to the light, but not enough. Not as much as I wanted to overcome my fear.

I slowly headed inside, calling out every few steps to make sure anyone who might be in there knew I was with security.

Inside, the rooms were bare. Completely empty. There was no sign they’d ever been used to run a business, and the only sign that I wasn’t the first person to set foot in there was the complete absence of dust or dirt. I checked another room, but it was exactly the same. The same with the third I checked, and the fourth.

Then I opened a normal-looking wooden door near the back. And I froze, once again on the threshold of something that didn’t make sense.

In front of me was what should have been a normal meeting room, but it was far from that. The floor was covered in water, pitch-black and utterly still. I knew in my mind it couldn’t be more than a few millimeters deep – it didn’t even spread past the doorway when I opened it – but as my torch light reflected off the surface, it seemed to me like it was much, much deeper.

In the center of the room was a plain wood and metal table, with a man lying on top of it. I had never seen him before. He lay motionless, and I could make out a thin, dark trickle of liquid flowing from his mouth and eyes over his face and dripping down the table legs into the dark water.

Three figures stood around him. The other workers from the office. Each was stood on a small square platform a few inches off the floor, facing directly towards the central table, arms outstretched and mouths wide as though they were screaming. They still made absolutely no sound.

I don’t know how long I was frozen there, staring at the scene in front of me. Nothing was right about what I was seeing. I started to scream at them, shouted to stop whatever they were doing or I’d call the police. They didn’t seem even remotely aware of me.

Finally, I decided I was going to leave – to make the call – but not before I got the man on the table out of there. He clearly needed help, and whatever these silent screamers were doing to him wasn’t helping.

I told them. I announced what I was about to do, but still got no response. So I stepped into the room and over to the table.

As soon as my foot hit the water, I fell into it completely. It was colder than anything I had ever experienced, and the torch slipped from my hand as my vision immediately went dark.

I tried to orientate myself, to find which way was up, and I saw a faint pinprick of light as my torch sank away from me, down and down and down into the icy black water.

I started to panic then, with the lightless deep pressing in on me, eager to take me away. I was absolutely sure that in a few moments there would be no surface left. Just dark, still water forever.

TREVOR (STATEMENT)
Luckily, I’d been watching a while.

I saw her go down. Didn’t have a clue what were going on – still don’t – but I were quick enough to get there and reach me arm into the water before she were too far gone.

It were bloody cold. Couldn’t see anything, obviously. I had my own light, but it just bounced off the surface. I could feel the back of her jacket down there, though, and I made a grab for it.

Now, I’m not as strong as I was, maybe, but I held on and pulled. Wasn’t enough to get her out. Something in there didn’t want to let her go. But I got her high enough that her arm broke the surface. She flailed a second, but got hold of the doorframe and started to pull herself out.

Took her a while, but she were almost there when I heard something moving behind us. Turned around to see Darvish stood there. And he did not look happy.

I were already holding the knife. I could smell him, so thick it tasted like rancid treacle. And whatever he was shouting was quieting the blood in my ears. It was gonna be good.

I got him once across the chest through his shirt, but he were a lot faster than I gave him credit for. He cracked me once hard across the face. I didn’t go down, but I didn’t get him with the blade again before he slammed his elbow to me gut.

That time I did go down, and I dropped to the floor. He were on top of me, hands around me throat, and I thought that was it – no waiting for the cancer. I’m not gonna lie, I was scared.

JULIA
I could still feel that dark water sticking to me, tugging at me, pleading me to fall back into it.

I pushed it from my mind, and I could just about make out the homeless man that saved me. He was struggling with someone, his torch fallen to the ground next to an old pocketknife. I grabbed the light and pointed it at them. Vardhan was on top of him, hands around the old man’s throat.

I saw those eyes properly, and for the first time I realized that Vardhan’s irises weren’t dark. It was just that the pupils were so wide that they swallowed them completely.

That wasn’t what did it, though. That wasn’t what made me pick up the struggling tramp’s pocket knife and plunge it in again and again into Vardhan Darvish’s throat.

No. What did that was the tattoo. Huge and dark on the chest beneath his rib shirt. The closed-eye sigil there was as familiar to me as the nightmares of my mother. I have never felt rage like I did then, and I have never felt anything as wonderful as the satisfaction of ending his life.

There was a shiver in the air as the floor behind me dried in an instant, and the three silent screamers dropped down dead. Well, I suppose they might have just been unconscious when they fell. But they were definitely dead by the time we left. The man on the table had never been alive to begin with.

TREVOR
I just knew, then.

I never even had to explain anything to her. She just gave me back the knife and we left together.

Wasn’t any question as to who I was or what I was doing.

We just clicked.

JULIA
Mm-hm. And we’ve been hunting together going on seven years now.

TREVOR
She ain’t too bad at it.

JULIA
You’re starting to slow down a bit, though.

TREVOR
(laugh) It’s just the lack of respect that gets me.

JULIA
And he’s going a bit senile, which is a shame.

TREVOR
Least I’m not so soft I need a featherbed.

JULIA
Beds are a good thing, old man! And I keep telling you – so are baths.

TREVOR
You see what I gotta put up with, Mr. Sims?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, um… (nervous laugh) Yeah… it’s, uh… it’s… what do you do for money?

JULIA
(annoyed) Sorry?

ARCHIVIST
I, I just, I-I doubt roaming around killing things pays all that well, What do you do to support yourselves?

JULIA
(exhale) Oh, I don’t know, we find ways. When you’re out here, the odd bit of robbery or trespass doesn’t really faze you.

ARCHIVIST
And, uh, why America?

[RESIGNED SIGHS, LAUGHTER]
TREVOR
Heard tell there were a wolfman.

[JULIA LAUGHS AT HIM]
Old Davey – he’s down in Plymouth – swore blind his brother had seen one on the Pacific Crest trail –

JULIA
I told Trevor he was a liar – but here we are anyway! Have been for a couple of years.

TREVOR
Hey, now, no wolfman, sure, but they’re’ve been plenty out here that needs killing!

JULIA
(annoyed sigh) True enough. Plus, it’s hard to leave. We’re not exactly here legally, and trying to get a flight home would get us noticed by authorities we’d rather avoid.

TREVOR
I keep telling her we could hop a boat!

JULIA
And I tell him I’d rather stay hunting here than trap myself on a boat for two weeks.

ARCHIVIST
…s-so, what have you –

[MUSTERMANN WHEEZES AND STRUGGLES TO SPEAK]
MUSTERMANN
Sh-sh-shut uuuuuup…

TREVOR
Oh-ho, hey! Look who’s talking!

[JULIA LAUGHS]
MUSTERMANN
(raspily, gasping) You could have at least chopped my ears off, too. You people just won’t shut up! Hhhhow am I supposed to get the lungs lined up right, when I can’t even con-concentrate…

JULIA
I’m fit to chop them off again if you need the practice.

MUSTERMANN
(gasping) Dooooo it! You’re the ones who want to talk.

ARCHIVIST
Why were you looking for me?

MUSTERMANN
(gasping) Wh-why do you think? Out here, exposed and unaware, on your own. At least I thought so. Thought it was a, a good chance to get you home, and get you ready for the dance.

JULIA
Is this that “Unknowing” dance?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, yeah… o-o-okay, uh, Mustermann, or whatever your name is –

MUSTERMANN
Just turn it off. You got more questions, then you turn that thing off!

ARCHIVIST
I don’t think you’re in any position to make demands.

MUSTERMANN
Maybe not, but are you sure you know what’s listening in?

ARCHIVIST
Do you?

MUSTERMANN
No. But I don’t like it.

TREVOR
What’s he mean, “listening in?”?

ARCHIVIST
What – no, I, I, I’m not –

JULIA
I knew this was a bad idea. Turn it off.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, no, no, it’s fine, it’s –

JULIA
Turn. It. Off.

Martin Blackwood, archival assistant at the Magnus Institute, recording statement number 0121403. Statement of Alexia Crawley, given March 14th, 2012.

Statement begins.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
It’s hard to put my relationship with Dexter Banks into words. It was a complicated thing, built on well over a decade of disdain and interdependence. In many ways I was closer to him than his wife – not that I ever touched the odious little freak. And while those film obsessives that insist I basically directed all his films do us both a disservice, it is true that without me he would never have reached the fame and high regard he enjoys. Enjoyed.

“Cinematographer.” Such an ornate term, yet still so vague. I often wonder if that’s to blame for how overlooked we are as a profession. Or even worse, that dry title, “Director of Photography.” But we are the true artists. A director may quite literally call the shots, but it is the cinematographer that makes them. We choose the angles, the lighting, pretty much everything that you see on the screen. The camera is a brush, and we are the hand, the arm, the eye. The director’s basically just the mouth, making pointless noise while the hand does the actual work. Almost every famous director that you know who has a distinctive visual style has simply managed to lock down a talented DoP.

I first worked with Dexter back in 1997, working as a cinematographer on Red Ronin. It feels odd to say now, but I was genuinely excited to work with him at the time. I’d seen some of his earlier work – Wasteland 7, Dolores, maybe a couple of shorts – and I remember thinking how refreshing it was going to be working with a director who really got film. Who was steeped in that history, and drew inspiration from forgotten corners of the medium. Even some corners that should have stayed forgotten.

Unfortunately, that turned out to be the only thing he understood. You see, Dexter Banks lived movies. As far as I could tell, every single aspect of his life had revolved around them. His dad had owned a small cinema near Fairfax Avenue, and as a teenager he’d bounced between working there and a small rental store that specialized in foreign films – specifically Italian horror movies and East Asian martial arts. I never met anyone who knew as much about films, and as little about anything else.

Working with him, it soon became clear that all he was interested in doing was recreating things he had seen. Taking scenes and music that he loved from those old, obscure corners of cinema and then constructing whatever patchwork narrative would allow him to shoot his own versions of them. Whatever dialogue he didn’t repurpose and had to write himself was stilted and slow. Trying to mirror the stylization that surrounded it, but failing utterly. I once mentioned to him the idea of working with a writer. I didn’t do it again.

Red Ronin, for instance, was based on a Japanese film from the early 70s called Blade of the Avenger. It hit on the same dynamics and scenes as the original, but was set in modern-day Arizona following a nihilistic ex-marine in the fictional town of Funnel. It wasn’t strictly a remake, though. Because Dexter would constantly call me into the screening room to show me some other samurai or Western that I’d never heard of, before jumping up at the appropriate scene and shouting, “that was it, we do that.”

And I did. I’m very good at my job. I’ve been doing it almost 30 years now – five at the BBC before crossing the Atlantic – and I know exactly what I’m doing. Turns out that I have a talent for capturing the feeling of older movies, mirroring them while still keeping the shots fresh. Who cares if it bored me to creative tears – it was exactly the sort of bull that critics loved, and Red Ronin was the first of Dexter’s films to get an Oscar nomination. Alhough it ended up losing out to The English Patient. Not really surprising, it was too genre for the Academy anyway.

I didn’t realize it, but by that point I was already locked in with Dexter. I’d held some ambitions about directing myself one day, but it soon became obvious that that wasn’t going to happen. Maybe if I’d got a feature under my belt before I was outed as trans, it might have been different, but as it was, that revelation burned too many bridges. And when the dust had settled, it was made abundantly clear to me that I was never going to get a movie of my own, and it was either cinematography, or nothing.

So I stayed. I was in a bad place for the next couple years, and blindly accepted the DoP position on two more of Dexter’s films: Hell’s Company and Leroy Slate. Both were big hits, and by the time I properly felt myself again, I had ended up with my career so tied up in Dexter’s that chasing other gigs wasn’t really an option. I still have no idea how intentional it was on his part, but he was definitely aware that it was my work that elevated his films above simple homage. His periodic bouts of petty jealousy and snide bitterness had made that abundantly clear. Five years and three movies in, it was clear that we needed each other almost as much as we hated each other.

I don’t know when he first mentioned his spider film. He didn’t bubble out into a full obsession until two years ago, but I know he talked about it plenty before that. Whenever arguments over a project would last late into the night, and if he was very drunk, he’d get kind of quiet, and then he’d ask me, yet again, if I’d ever seen Kumo Ga Tabeteiru.

I think that was the name, anyway – something like that. He was normally slurring quite badly when he said it. He thought it translated to “The Spiders That Devour,” but a Japanese friend once told me it was actually closer to just “spiders are eating.”

According to Dexter, Kumo was an old tokusatsu movie, which he believed had come out sometime in the mid-to-late-60s. It was about a spider – just the one, despite the title – that grew to a colossal size and terrorized a small unnamed island off the coast of Kagoshima. What struck him about it, though, was the utter absence of anything resembling a hero or protagonist. No one fought against the monster. And although there were vignettes in the lives of those under the spider’s shadow, they all ended the exact same way: with the character in question marching slowly and calmly into its waiting jaws.

Whenever Dexter described this, his eyes would widen and he’d start trying to recreate the sound that they made as they were eaten. He always claimed he wasn’t doing it right, but the noises he ended up making were unsettling enough.

As far as either of us could determine, the film never existed. At least, not in any form that left a traceable record. Dexter had followed it up in a lot more detail than I had ever bothered to, and had checked with collectors of obscure film paraphernalia and long-defunct Japanese production studios. He actually showed a pretty surprising aptitude for the language. But it was just dead end after dead end. I ended up watching half a dozen different giant spider movies with him over our time together, and none of them were right. He’d just watch, muttering under his breath “no, no, no,” and chewing on the back of his thumb.

It wasn’t something I ever really minded. Of all the many and varied quirks of Dexter Banks, his minor obsession with a Japanese spider movie that may or may not have ever existed was one of the least unpleasant. At least, until I got the call about his final project. He told me over the phone that he was producing a new film, that he was going to be his masterpiece. Then he started to describe it, and I don’t know how much of what I felt was deja vu, and how much was just dread.

I asked if he had found a copy of the film, or the script, but he just laughed. “Better,” he said. “I found the book it was based on.”

Then he hung up, and I was left sitting there, feeling this gnawing apprehension that I just couldn’t place. I realized what had disturbed me later. It was such a small thing, but it really nagged at me. It was the idea that Dexter would ever describe a book as better than a film. That sounds like I’m insulting him, but you need to know him to understand. Film was everything to him. Other media might as well not have existed.

Regardless, he went into production. He called it “Widow’s Weave,” and while the script pages he brought were apparently based on this unnamed book of his, the shots were drawn from his memories of the first film version. Assuming it existed anywhere outside of his head, of course. Part of me secretly assumed Dexter had simply dreamed the movie up and this book was… eh, it didn’t matter. Not really. There wasn’t any question about whether or not I was working on it. It was a Dexter Banks film! And my name was basically on the credits already.

The crew were mostly regulars he’d worked with before, but weirdly for him, he seems to take almost no interest in casting at all. He asked Debbie Connor, our casting director, to get him as many no-name, untested hopefuls as the script needed. Bear in mind that at this point, any A-lister would have killed to be in a Dexter Banks picture. But he didn’t care. For all he kept telling me about how this was his dream project that he was electrified to finally be making, he seemed to have almost entirely checked out of the process of actually making it.

There was one exception to this. He claimed to be working with Neil Lagorio to make the spider. Now, you might never have heard his name before, but I guarantee you you’ll have seen his work. From the mid-70s right into CGI, Lagorio was the name in practical creature effects. Suit work, stop-motion, animatronics – whatever the method, he was the master. If you’ve watched any genre films at all from before 2005, there’s basically no chance you haven’t seen one of his creatures.

His early work was strictly horror, but in his prime he worked on basically any blockbuster that used practical effects for monsters or aliens. I’d had the pleasure of working with him way back in 1989 on Orbit, a medium-budget sci-fi vehicle for some aging action star. Neil was working on a 12-foot-tall animatronic robot that featured heavily in the climax. The picture was, unsurprisingly, a flop, but I still remember his work. How he brought a lump of wood and steel to life, the huge intricate mechanisms that allowed his crew to puppet it into motion that was so natural you could forget that the back of it was completely hollow.

Out of all of the odd changes with Dexter’s behavior, his excitement over working with Neil Lagorio was the one thing that I shared with him. Not that I got a chance to do anything with that excitement. Once production started, Dexter became secretive and jumpy. He told us he’d set up a workshop for Lagorio and his team in one of the larger empty spaces on the lot. But no one except him was to go inside, or make any contact with the practical effects department.

It was odd, but everyone knew better than to argue. Once Dexter had an idea in his head, he would throw you off the set for trying to change it. When it really needed to happen, people generally looked to me to do so, since I was one they considered un-fireable. And this time, I did, saying that I’d worked with Neil before, and would love a chance to catch up with him. Dexter curtly explained that Neil had become reclusive in his retirement, and had only agreed to work on this picture on condition of absolute privacy. I didn’t push the issue. It didn’t seem like the battle to waste my energy on.

And there were certainly plenty more battles once shooting began. If you’re wondering how easy it is to recreate shots that only exist in the hazy memory of an eccentric, or to frame scenes when you only get the typo-riddled script the morning before, I can tell you: not easy. Not easy at all. And Dexter’s constant outbursts didn’t help. Throwing people off the set over the smallest imagined offenses, or throwing away a whole day’s shoot because “it just didn’t feel right.” We were burning through money and goodwill faster than I had ever seen, even on the most slapdash of his earlier projects.

The cast really impressed me, though. Most of them were fresh out of drama school, with maybe a couple of ads under their belt, and a few older faces who’d clearly spend most of their life hurling themselves at closed doors until now. Most impressive to me, though, was a guy called Brandon Omar. He was playing the closest thing the film had to a protagonist, a homeless ex-Methodist minister who’d found himself on the island by chance, and served as a connecting thread, wandering between the scenes and the vignettes of the inhabitants after each ended with their march to the spider.

Brandon took to the role immediately, with a gravity and a weariness that I don’t think could have been entirely feigned. He was the only one who didn’t seem excited by the movie, and spent his off hours smoking and reading quietly in one of the trailers. It was a shame, because for whatever reason, he also seemed to be the only one that Dexter would listen to. I only saw them talking once or twice, but every time, Dexter would be rapt, nodding at whatever Brandon might have to say.

Of course, I never really had time to think on it. I was finding it an almost impossible task to get even the most basic of shots, with Dexter constantly demanding the whole setup be changed for no reason. Like I said, I’m excellent at my job, but giving him what he wanted from the camerawork relied on him actually knowing it himself. There was a frenzied nervous energy to his instructions, and if I didn’t know any better, I might have even said that he wasn’t just afraid that the shots might not work, he was afraid of the idea.

And so it was, for the first few weeks. Dexter clearly wasn’t sleeping. He had insisted on using old equipment, and avoided digital almost entirely, to the point where several of the crew were using pieces of kit they’d never even seen before. This meant that a work print had to be made manually for the dailies, something he refused to let anyone else do. Once shooting wrapped, he’d be in the editing room for hours, preparing dailies, although they shouldn’t have needed editing at all. And when we watched them, I’d often noticed that certain shots were missing, stuff I was certain that we’d filmed. I brought this up with him once, and he called me a liar to my face.

I only interrupted him when he was preparing dailies once. An actress who was slated to be shooting the next day had taken violently ill. The crew needed his sign-off to change the schedule. No one else dared to go in, so once again it was down to me to head into that tiny room alone.

It was dark inside, lit only by what spilled in through the open doorway. I could hear a sound like the turning of an old film reel, but I couldn’t say where from. I stood there, unable to step inside, not because of fear, but because this space inside was threaded all over with film strips. Up and down, one side to the other, wrapping around and through each other. I gingerly reached out and touched one. And as I did, Dexter seemed to emerge from the darkness. At first I thought he was taller than usual, but then I realized that he was suspended ever so slightly by the strips of film, his feet a good couple of inches off the floor.

He was very calm as he asked what I wanted, and when I stutteringly explained the situation, he just nodded and said we should feel free to rearrange however we liked. Then he closed the door, and I left. Trying very hard to convince myself that he had only had two arms.

Shooting continued, but there was a growing awareness throughout the crew that we had still seen nothing from Neil Lagorio. No one had met him on set, or spotted him or his team entering or leaving the workshop where the spider was supposedly being constructed. No one had heard the sound of work being done in there, and the rumor was that Dexter had finally lost it, and the workshop was empty. We had run through all the scenes that could be done without it, and everyone was getting really impatient.

Finally, Dexter announced it was time for the unveiling. For the spider, for kumo, to make its appearance. We were all excited as we assembled outside the workshop, but there was a nervous energy in the air that day. It was about as cold as it ever gets in LA, but the shiver that passed through us when he told us it was time was something else entirely.

Dexter told us the actors would see it first. He gave no reasoning for this, and silenced the outcry from a couple of the crew with a vicious glare. He then gathered up the cast and, with Brandon leading them, took them through a small door in the side of the workshop. And they disappeared inside.

I’ve thought back over those minutes so many times, trying to decide if I’d heard or seen anything that might have explained what happened inside that building. But in the end, I have to admit that I didn’t. Minutes passed, then half an hour, as we waited impatiently for Dexter or the others to return.

It seems like a sick cosmic joke that that was the day the press broke the news of Neil Lagorio’s death. Half an hour after the cast walked into that building, one of the grips stumbled across the news story whilst idly checking his phone. Lagorio had been privately suffering from Parkinson’s for almost a decade, and had been bedridden in his Connecticut home for the last year.

We knew then that, whatever was going on inside that building, it was not Neil Lagorio debuting a new animatronic creation. Once again, all eyes turned to me.

I’m still not entirely sure what I saw on the other side of that door. I probably saw nothing, like the cops who arrived shortly afterwards. The place was entirely empty after all, just as the rumors had always said. But I wouldn’t be here talking to you if I thought that was true, now, would I?

Because I remember that first moment – that instant of looking up when I first entered. I saw it, perfectly interwoven with a hundred cocoons, writhing and dangling, stretching out far above me. And in its center, those black and shining eyes that focused on my entrance. The legs that worked so fast as to be a blur. The fangs that dripped their poison onto Dexter Banks. Then, in a moment, it was all gone – scuttling up and into nowhere, pulling its impossible web behind it.

I never knew how to describe my relationship with Dexter, and I still don’t. How he was complicit, and how much he was simply caught in his own neuroses and fears, I don’t know. I know he didn’t deserve what happened to him.

I found the book, by the way. And I burned it. If I ever track down the man who used to own it, I might just burn him too.

MARTIN
Statement ends.

I think Alexia might be a bit too late for that. I mean, I think it sounds like a Jurgen Leitner book. About spiders. Hm. Good John didn’t have to read this one, anyway. I know he’s not a fan. Although, this one wasn’t too bad, actually! I – yeah. Anyway.

This is, I suppose, one explanation for the disappearance of Dexter Banks, along with almost a hundred cast members, back in 2012. There’s not a lot I can really add that hasn’t been already dissected by a hundred different tabloid magazines and mystery shows. Even the, um, arachnid angle has been covered, as it seems that when we weren’t a lot of help, Alexia Crawley told her full story to the press. She was not treated kindly, and refuses to discuss the events any further. Poor thing.

Yeah, but Basira did manage to get hold of a few things from recent LAPD files that haven’t been released to the public yet. Though she’s a bit cagey as to how she got them.

Apparently, over the last five years, every February a corpse is found washed up on Redondo Beach. It’ll be a shriveled husk, with all moisture and internal organs apparently removed. These corpses are usually unidentifiable, but the one that washed up last year was confirmed to be Chadwick Frazier, an aspiring actor who went missing in 2012, and whose IMDB page lists a final credit for Widow’s Weave.

Um. Th-that’s it.

MARTIN
– no, that doesn’t make sense! Can he even do that?

BASIRA
I don’t know. I guess so.

MARTIN
So, what, he can just reach into your head and put something in there?!

BASIRA
I don’t know. I guess so.

MARTIN
I mean. Does it even have to be a true thing? Do we, do we know for sure he’s not lying, like, like magically lying?

BASIRA
I don’t know.

MARTIN
Right, right, right. Sorry. I just – it’s a lot to take in, you know.

BASIRA
Mostly for Melanie, yeah.

MARTIN
Oh, of course, yep. Sorry.

BASIRA
Look, I’m not the one you need – [sigh]

We can’t just ignore it.

MARTIN
Well, yeah, but what do we – we didn’t even know that that was something he could do! What if there’s other stuff he could do to us?!

BASIRA
We are not letting him get away with it.

MARTIN
I didn’t say that.

BASIRA
Look, Martin. I know you care. I know you do. But caring isn’t enough. You can’t just stand next to someone with a cup of tea and hope everything’s gonna be all right.

MARTIN
That’s. Not. Fair. You don’t even know me.

BASIRA
Prove it. We need to do something. Because if we just let him –

MARTIN
– oh, h-hi! Hey, hey Melanie, uh, can I get youuuu – a… cup… of… tea?

MELANIE
So, she told you, then?

BASIRA
We need everyone, if we’re gonna have any chance.

MELANIE
Right.

MARTIN
What about Tim?

MELANIE
Tim is…

BASIRA
Elias is watching him too closely.

MELANIE
He’s probably watching me, too.

MARTIN
We could, uh, we could try the tunnels! John says they might help!

MELANIE
Right.

BASIRA
Or maybe… when he’s not paying attention. Distracted, like during your, um, your performance review.

MELANIE
Wait, what do you mean?

MARTIN
Yeah, what?

BASIRA
Well, I was heading out, and Martin, you remember you knocked over that huge stack of papers?

MARTIN
I, I, they shouldn’t have been there in the first place! Besides, I cleaned them up!

BASIRA
But not in the right order. And when I brought them up to Elias yesterday, he asked why they were messed up.

MARTIN
Y… You didn’t tell him it was me…?

BASIRA
That’s not the point, Martin. The point is –

MELANIE
He wasn’t watching you. He was busy.

BASIRA
Yep.

MARTIN
Hang on…

BASIRA
Not here. The tunnels.

MARTIN
Right, right, right.

[PAUSE]
MARTIN

ARCHIVIST
Right, so I just… read it?

JULIA
He’s the last page.

TREVOR
[Snorts] Good luck. I guess.

ARCHIVIST
Ah, you’re not staying to… I dunno, keep an eye on me?

JULIA
It’s not a… Trevor doesn’t like using the book. I don’t either. Makes me feel off. Dead should stay dead.

ARCHIVIST
S-So… I mean, why keep it around?

TREVOR
‘Cause sometimes talking to the dead can stop you joining ‘em. Come on Julia.

JULIA
Ah, just give us a knock when you’re done.

ARCHIVIST
Sure.

Okay.

[DEEP BREATH]
“His consciousness faded in and out like the tide. He tried to refuse their drugs, though for what purpose even he could not have said. Perhaps he was simply trying to push away the smell of disinfectant and grief that rose from his hospital bed. She was there sometimes, the one he had followed around the world. There was almost sadness in her eyes. He felt himself begin to slip, the icy certainty of what was happening seeping through his flesh, and as he fell away for the final time, he felt that all-consuming fear. And his only thought was to cry out for his mother. But with the last vestige of his stubborn will, he refused. She would not claim his last moment. He was silent.

[OMINOUS RUMBLE WITH A SIDE OF CRACKLING RISES TO CRESCENDO]
And so Gerard Keay ended.”

Gerard? Gerard Keay?

GERARD
You’re new. Did you kill them?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… who?

GERARD
The Hunters. They had this book. Are they dead?

ARCHIVIST
N-No.

GERARD
Then piss off. I told them I’m not talking.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry, what?

GERARD
[Tired] I’m not their bloody Monster Manual. I’m done.

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I didn’t – I mean, that’s not what this is.

GERARD
No? They didn’t hand me over for you to use, like I’m a bloody dictionary wrapped in a special box?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… Yeah.

GERARD
Like I said.

…

You got a cigarette?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, oh, yeah. Here. C-Can you smoke it?

GERARD
Ugh. I guess not.

…

Yeah…

…

Nice lighter. You a spider freak, then?

ARCHIVIST
What? Oh! Er, no. I-I never really, uh… I never really thought of it. I-I’m John. I’m with the Magnus Institute.

…

I-I’m the Archivist.

…

GERARD
When did she die?

ARCHIVIST
About a year after you did.

GERARD
Was it peaceful?

ARCHIVIST
…

No.

GERARD
Good. Don’t think she would have wanted that.

God, I can’t imagine her dying in bed.

…

So you’re the new guy, then? Following in her footsteps?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, some of them. They… don’t exactly lead where I thought they would.

GERARD
Yeah, she was like that.

ARCHIVIST
I-I’m trying to stop the Unknowing.

GERARD
[Exhales] She didn’t manage it, then?

ARCHIVIST
Not before she, uh… I need your help.

GERARD
[Snorts] Do you now?

ARCHIVIST
She thought she’d found a-a way to stop it. I think. If anyone knows what that was, it’s you.

GERARD
…

No.

ARCHIVIST
What? W-Why not? If, if it happens, if the Circus –

GERARD
Yeah, the world changes in horrible ways. For you. I’m a book.

ARCHIVIST
You can’t be serious.

GERARD
I’m dead serious.

[GHOSTLY CHUCKLE]
It hurts. Being like this. And it’s not like any pain you can feel when you’re alive. It’s… it hurts to exist. To be dead and still here. And those two want to keep me like this, so I can answer questions about their Dracula of the week. So no. Help me, or you go to your little apocalypse with nothing.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. What do you want?

GERARD
I want to go away. I want you to take my page and burn it.

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I can’t do th– They’d know! They’d kill me.

GERARD
Tear it out and take it, then. Do it somewhere else.

ARCHIVIST
B-B-But if they check the book –

GERARD
Guess you better hope they don’t.

ARCHIVIST
Gerard, please…

GERARD
You want answers, you tear out my page now! So I know you can’t back out.

ARCHIVIST
…

[Deep sigh] Okay.

GERARD
Okay.

ARCHIVIST
[Exhales] Ready?

[GERARD INHALES, SUPPRESSING THE PAIN, OVER THE SOUND OF FIBRES RIPPING]
There.

GERARD
Thank you.

ARCHIVIST
Well, you’ve probably killed me.

GERARD
Dying isn’t so bad. It’s staying dead that sucks.

ARCHIVIST
Well, these nuggets of wisdom are certainly worth it so far.

GERARD
Relax. They won’t notice.

ARCHIVIST
So?

GERARD
Okay, you got questions.

ARCHIVIST
Just one. How do I stop the Unknowing?

GERARD
[Casually] No, I don’t know.

ARCHIVIST
[Incensed] What?!

GERARD
Oh, okay, okay, I don’t know exactly, but… me and Gertrude went all over, tracking clowns and skinwalkers, trying to find a way to mess it up. I didn’t find much, but Gertrude, she figured a few things out. She reckoned it could be delayed, but nothing we could do beforehand would actually stop it properly. Even the Dancer could be replaced. But, once it starts, then it might be vulnerable.

ARCHIVIST
Vulnerable to what?

GERARD
I dunno.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, goddamn it!

GERARD
But she did say she thought she had something that could do it.

ARCHIVIST
What?

GERARD
Well, not long before I ended up in the hospital, she told me that if something got her first, I was… There’s a storage unit on an industrial estate up near Hainault. She said she rented it under the name Jan Kelly, and hid a key for it somewhere in the Archives.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Uh, I-I think I found that.

GERARD
Well, it’s in that storage unit. Whatever she thought might disrupt the ritual, stop the Unknowing, that’s where it’ll be.

ARCHIVIST
But you don’t know what it is?

GERARD
No. When I asked her, she said she’d show me when we got back to London. Mind you, she had this weird look in her eyes, like it was some kind of a joke.

ARCHIVIST
I mean… it wasn’t, w-was it? A-A joke.

GERARD
I don’t think so. Gertrude didn’t make jokes.

ARCHIVIST
Well, worst-case scenario I suppose I… continue to have nothing.

GERARD
I guess.

…

So… uh, you’re the Archivist now?

ARCHIVIST
Whatever that means.

GERARD
Can’t help you much there. Gertrude was always kind of cagey about it.

ARCHIVIST
Sh-She never showed any… er, abilities, or talked about… I don’t know, destiny? Like she was… b-becoming something?

GERARD
Hmmm… Well, she could make people tell her stuff, sometimes. They’d suddenly get real talkative, and lay out whatever she needed. She didn’t do it often though. I don’t think she liked it.

ARCHIVIST
[Perky] Oh, er, I can do that, too.

GERARD
Huh. Do you like it?

ARCHIVIST
I-I don’t know. I never really thought about it.

Yes, I… I suppose I do.

GERARD
Hmmm.

ARCHIVIST
Did she read statements?

GERARD
Sometimes. If she was getting shaky. They perked her up, I think. Feeding the Eye, you know? I’d sometimes hear her through the wall, just reading into the air, feeling it all.

ARCHIVIST
She… she didn’t use a tape recorder?

GERARD
Not when I was with her. She travelled light. Left things behind.

ARCHIVIST
Kind of sounds like you didn’t… trust her.

GERARD
Yeah, I didn’t. I wanted to, I really did, but it was always the work. Sometimes she just reminded me of my mum.

Did you ever meet her, my mum?

ARCHIVIST
[Flustered] Erm… Not in, not in person, it was er… O-Only by reputation.

GERARD
Huh. Well, she was also, um, ‘goal-orientated’. Ruthless. But at least Gertrude tried to do something worthwhile with it. My mum only had her ambitions. She’d never have even admitted it, though. She was too proud for that. She saw herself as real working class, always said the occult was just a club for rich boys playing politics with things they didn’t understand. Reckoned her tradition was less the academic and more the, uh…

ARCHIVIST
V-Village witch?

GERARD
[Laughingly] You sure you don’t know her?

Yeah. But deep down what she wanted wasn’t all that different from the ivory tower idiots she hated. Y’know, I think, secretly, she dreamed of starting a little mystic dynasty of her own. With me.

ARCHIVIST
Like the, the Lukases? Or the Fairchilds?

GERARD
Well, Fairchild’s just a name, they’re not really family. The Lukases, though, yeah. Thing is, it’s harder than it looks. What’s out there… doesn’t care about blood.

ARCHIVIST
Well, I-I mean, except for the vampires…

GERARD
Yeah, obviously except for the vampires. But they care about your choices, your fears, not your parents. Families are just useful ‘cause they can push you in the right direction. And the Lukases are very good at that.

ARCHIVIST
And I imagine they’re not… reluctant to remove any members that might put that legacy at risk.

GERARD
Right. You know, for a group that worships a power of loneliness, they never seem to have any problems breeding, or finding spooky singles to marry them. Just one of those things, I guess. But most times you try to put your descendants on the path to worship, it doesn’t go great. Just takes one stubborn heir to freak out about the truth, and the whole thing comes crashing down.

ARCHIVIST
And… that was you?

GERARD
Yeah. Turns out not everyone grows up caring about power and knowledge like my mum.

ARCHIVIST
What happened?

GERARD
I tried to abandon her.

ARCHIVIST
I see.

Do you… want to make a statement?

[GERARD GIVES A SMALL LAUGH]
GERARD
Why not? I’ll try to make it quick, before the Van Helsings get bored.

ARCHIVIST
Right. [Cough] Right.

Er… Statement of Gerard Keay, deceased, regarding the death of his mother, Mary Keay. Statement taken posthumously from subject, June 30th, 2017.

Statement begins.

GERARD (STATEMENT)
My mum spent her whole life feeling cheated.

She used to tell me with a kind of sneer that “destiny is for lords”, and I think in her own way she actually believed that. You know, she felt we weren’t important enough for a destiny. But she never forgot that she came from a noble house: Von Closen. All wrapped up in mystery and power. At least, that’s what my mum believed. I was never able to find much on them, at all. Nothing that would say there was anything special about them except, y’know, maybe their connection to the Magnus Institute and Jonah Magnus. But she’d never accept that. To her, her ancestors were these ‘powerful sages of terrible gods’, their ‘destinies stolen from them by an idle dilettante’. [Snorts] Least that’s how she told it to me.

I remember that Jurgen Leitner was the first man I ever really hated. I’d never met him, but that was the name on the books that my mum spent all her time reading, and half the time when she actually looked at me, it was to teach me about one of them. She idolised him, I think, almost as much as she despised him. She thought he’d managed what she always dreamed of: using these entities, without being bound to them. I think she saw him as some kind of sorcerer. So she studied those books that she could find, but she always came back to this one, this unnamed catalogue of the trapped dead. It was her first, she always told me, and would probably be her last.

I never knew my dad. Not really. He worked in the Archives like you, but quit once I was born. I think he wanted to help raise me. But mum didn’t need the help, and after me she wasn’t able to have kids again, so she killed him in his sleep to practice her bookbinding. I guess she failed. I always thought he was in here, but when I eventually got hold of it, there wasn’t a page in there.

She did her best to look after me, and bring me into this world she inhabited, but she wasn’t a caring mother or a skilled teacher. My struggling at her lessons infuriated her. I mean, looking back now I can see that her knowledge was basic at best. But I was a kid. I could only try to avoid her temper, and learn my weird lessons, writing out nonsense, and pretending I understood paradoxes that most adults couldn’t handle.

We travelled a lot. Between her day job as a rare bookseller and her… vocation, it wasn’t often we stayed in London for more than a month. We met with things that almost made me throw up, I was so afraid, and she’d talk to them like old friends. It was awful, but I suppose in many ways, it worked. Whenever I tried to run away the ‘real’ world seemed so… ignorant I could never be a part of it. So I did my best to find my place within my mum’s world. As an idiot teenager I hunted Leitner’s books with the best of them, even found a few. I’d bring them home, and watch her eyes light up. But it was always the books that she was happy to see.

Eventually, I grew old enough and wise enough to see her obsession for what it really was: hubris. She lived just carefully enough not to be destroyed by things she studied, but that was it. The things out there, they weren’t like taming fire, they couldn’t be contained or used for light or warmth. The best you could hope for from them, would be that they don’t spot you, and instead my mum chased after them, obsessed with others who had tried to stare at them without being blinded: y’know, Flamsteed, Smirke, Leitner. Idiots who destroyed themselves chasing a secret that wasn’t worth knowing. And the worst thing was, she marked me as a part of that, without my understanding. Or consent.

Our relationship, such as it was, it quickly went downhill. But I never managed to leave. I just couldn’t bring myself to finally cut that cord and abandon her, no matter what she said. And I think she knew that. I think she knew she had me trapped. But it was a hollow victory. She also knew that I wouldn’t continue her work, that whatever destiny she had tried to write for the Von Closen line, died with her. I think that might have been what finally pushed her to do it. To try and take full control of the book.

I remember the smell when I came back to the shop that day, the heavy blood smell. She had just finished writing on the third sheet she’d hung on that old fishing wire, laced between the shelves, and she was on the edge of passing out. She wouldn’t stop, though. She wouldn’t give in. She thrust a razor blade and a marker pen at me, and begged me to help her finish. Everything was red, every possible shade of dark, and wet, and drying crimson. I turned to run but I slipped, fell to the floor and I crawled, panicking, down into the street. I managed to stagger to a coffee shop across the road, and I just sat there in shock until the police arrived.

Between the blood on my clothes, eyewitnesses who saw me leaving, and the fact the mutilations were so awful the judge said it was “inconceivable to suggest they were self-inflicted”, it seemed like an open-and-shut case. And honestly, there was a part of me which thought a life in prison was an alright price for freedom. Trouble was, whatever ritual my mum tried to do? It worked. She had bound herself to the book, and was able to manifest almost at will. How she removed it from police custody I don’t know, but it left enough of the other evidence ‘contaminated’ that my case was judged a mistrial. I was later told there wasn’t enough evidence to charge me again. Apparently, several witnesses had withdrawn their testimony. I wasn’t going to be imprisoned, but… I was a long way from free.

She was waiting for me when I got home. The half-finished ritual had left her… damaged. She was powerful, but… erratic. Of course she blamed me for her new state, said if I had helped her she would have been completely beyond death. But as she was, she wasn’t going anywhere.

For the next five years she haunted my life. I did what she asked, but whenever her form faded for a few days, I would take what little revenge I could: I burned books, I covered leads. I occasionally fled to somewhere I thought it’d be hard for her to follow.

And in the end, it was Gertrude who saved me. She came to me when I was desperate, nowhere to go, and she offered to help. I just had to make sure I took the book while my mum was fading, and brought it to her, and then she would free me. I didn’t really believe her, I don’t think, but I did it anyway. When she returned the book to me a week later, her pages burned and mangled, I think I actually cried with relief.

I never even considered that my mum might have taught Gertrude how to make pages for it before she was destroyed.

[Sigh] I think you know the rest. I joined Gertrude’s work for a few years. Didn’t realise how ill I was until it finally caught up with me. Then I died.

I think… I think I finally understand why she brought me back. I just don’t understand why she left me behind.

ARCHIVIST
What was Gertrude’s work?

GERARD
What?

ARCHIVIST
I-I mean, I – Sorry, I-I know a lot about what Gertrude did, but I don’t really know… why she was doing any of it, or w-what her intentions were.

GERARD
Same as you. I think.

ARCHIVIST
Stopping the Unknowing?

GERARD
Not just the Unknowing. All of them.

ARCHIVIST
There are more rituals…

GERARD
That’s what she said.

ARCHIVIST
W-W-What do they do?

GERARD
I mean… they change the world. They make it new.

ARCHIVIST
An apocalypse.

GERARD
Kind of.

How much do you know about these things, the Eye and that?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t – Uh… they’re, they’re malicious. Many consider them god-like and t-they have the power to affect the world in unnatural ways, but they cannot directly exist within it, so they rely on avatars or, or servants that they corrupt and… sometimes monsters that they create. They use their power in ways small enough to stay hidden, a-and I think… I think they feed on our fear.

GERARD
No, they don’t feed on it. They are it.

ARCHIVIST
What? W-what do you mean?

GERARD
I mean what I said. These things, these forces, they are our fear. Deep fears. Primordial. Always looking for ways to grow and spread.

ARCHIVIST
No… B-B-But that doesn’t – I m-mean, it doesn’t make –

GERARD
What? So you thought it was coincidence that unknowable alien consciousnesses from beyond our universe just so happen to basically be all the things we’re terrified of?

ARCHIVIST
I – How?!

GERARD
No idea.

Smarter people than me have died trying to figure that one out. I mean, maybe they appeared out of nothing the first time something felt afraid. Maybe they’re older than that, and they just got inspired by all the things that we dread. Did they make themselves from our fears, or are they why we’re afraid? I really don’t know.

ARCHIVIST
But, but not everything they do inspires fear.

GERARD
And if you’re having an omelette for lunch, not every moment is spent eating the omelette. Some things take preparation. Especially if, you know, your spatula has a bit of free will. And sometimes I think bits of them just… ooze into the world without any purpose at all. Or sometimes they’re summoned.

ARCHIVIST
Fears change. Fears are-are-are cultural.

GERARD
A lot of them, yeah, but others are deeper than that. And when our fears change, so do these things. But it’s not quick. Gertrude reckons they’ve basically been the same since the Industrial Revolution. She and my mum both liked to follow Smirke’s list of fourteen.

ARCHIVIST
[Disbelievingly] Th– I mean, there are a lot more than fourteen things to be afraid of in the world. Where do you draw the line?

GERARD
Hmmm.

I always think it helps to imagine them like colours. The edges bleed together, and you can talk about little differences: “oh, that’s indigo, that’s more lilac”, but they’re both purple. I mean, I guess there are technically infinite colours, but you group them together into a few big ones. A lot of it’s kind of arbitrary. I mean, why are navy blue and sky blue both called blue, when pink’s an entirely different colour from red? Y’know? I don’t know, that’s just how it works.

And like colours, some of these powers, they feed into or balance each other. Some really clash, and you just can’t put them together. I mean, you could see them all as just one thing, I guess, but it would be pretty much meaningless, y’know, like… like trying to describe a… shirt by talking about the concept of colour.

O-Of course, with these things it’s not a simple spectrum, y’know, it’s more like –

ARCHIVIST
An infinite amorphous blob of terror bleeding out in every direction at once.

GERARD
Now you’re getting it.

ARCHIVIST
Like colours, but if colours hated me. Got it. Christ, I need a cigarette.

GERARD
Yeah, well, you can wait. Don’t know how much longer we have.

ARCHIVIST
Hang on, if these entities are all based on our, on our fear, the-the-then what, what about the, the rest –

GERARD
No. There aren’t any god-like powers of hope, or love, or indigestion, or whatever. At least not that I’ve seen. Just fear. I don’t know why.

ARCHIVIST
Fine.

So… so, I know a, a few… but what are they, these fourteen?

GERARD
[Recites] “Robert Smirke divided the beings into fourteen distinct Powers, each comprising a variety of smaller terrors, some direct and practical, and some more abstract.”

ARCHIVIST
R-r-right. I know The Eye. Fear of being watched, right?

GERARD
Being watched, being followed, having your deepest secrets exposed. Needing to know, even if your discoveries might destroy you. The feeling that something, somewhere, is letting you suffer, just so it can watch.

ARCHIVIST
Is… is that me? Is… is that what I do?

GERARD
You’re the Archivist, you tell me.

ARCHIVIST
Ah…

Ah.

The Spiral is the fear of madness, right? That worry that your world isn’t right, th-that your mind is lying to you?

GERARD
Yeah, pretty much.

ARCHIVIST
And The End is fear of death.

GERARD
Simple, but always there.

ARCHIVIST
The Stranger is the, the unknown. The uncanny.

GERARD
That kind of creeping sense that something’s not right. That guy you saw that might be following you, might mean you harm.

ARCHIVIST
Isolation.

GERARD
Smirke called it The Lonely. The feeling that you’re just… alone. Maybe there’s no-one else there at all, maybe you just can’t connect.

ARCHIVIST
Then there’s… burning, the, uh, the Lightless Flame.

GERARD
The Desolation. Fear of pain, fear of loss, fear of unthinking or cruel destruction.

ARCHIVIST
Does it… watch over, um, war as, as well? Or is, is that The End?

GERARD
I mean, I think they both get a lot out of war, but you’re thinking of The Slaughter. It’s not cruel, exactly, or unstoppable like The End. It’s just pure violence, not targeted or premeditated, just… unpredictable violence. And you don’t know when, or if it’s even coming. Sometimes it’s aggressive, like a frenzied killer, but sometimes it’s calm, like an army firing shells into a village. The Slaughter’s not that common in peace but, well, you know, there’s always a war somewhere.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

And, and then th-there’s, uh… Vertigo. The fear of, the fear of falling.

GERARD
The Vast. Vertigo, agoraphobia, the dread of deep water, of our own insignificance before the universe.

ARCHIVIST
And on the other side, claustrophobia?

GERARD
The Buried. Small spaces, crushing, you can’t breathe. You’re at the centre of everything, and it all pushes down on you. If the Vast is like losing yourself in too much space, the Buried is being trapped without enough.

ARCHIVIST
Darkness?

GERARD
The Dark, yeah. That’s an old one, and one of the deepest. I mean, who isn’t a little bit afraid of the dark? Of what might be in it?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. And there, um… I think Filth, it’s, it’s disease, but also insects?

GERARD
The Corruption. Ooh, it’s a nasty one, that one. Just… disgust. Rot, decay, infection. That feeling of your skin crawling or itching, being touched by something that might burrow inside you. Swarming and hollowing you out. Leaving you full of holes.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. Not spiders, though?

GERARD
No. They belong to The Web.

ARCHIVIST
Which is… spiders a-and control. Your, your will not being your own.

GERARD
Yeah. Being manipulated or puppeted. The worry you’re caught in a trap you can’t see.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

…

What about meat? How does that work?

GERARD
Ah, The Flesh?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, I-I mean, are we really so afraid of being… eaten? Of our bodies being all twisted up, i-i-is that… I mean, some people sure, but… how is it one of the fourteen great fears?

GERARD
What? You think people are so special it’s only our fear that counts?

ARCHIVIST
Wh– No…

GERARD
Everything feels afraid sometimes. Sure, maybe it’s not as complicated or… existential as our fear, but it’s real. And there’s, what, twenty billion chickens in the world? A few billion pigs, cows… How many of them are dying of old age? All that terror, it has to go somewhere. So it does.

ARCHIVIST
And when something formed out of an animalistic fear of the slaughterhouse reaches out to, to people…

GERARD
Things get weird. Yeah. It gets mixed all up with human neuroses: bodies, gore, y’know, that nagging worry that deep down we’re just electrified meat squeezing air at each other.

ARCHIVIST
Good lord.

GERARD
I think it’s quite new. Only just beginning its, uh, ascendance when Smirke labelled it. Before that there just weren’t enough animals for it to be a fear of its own. Back then I think the only animal fear was The Hunt.

ARCHIVIST
The Hunt is also animals?

GERARD
Yeah. Been a long time since humans had any proper sense of our place on the food chain. I mean, we haven’t been ‘prey’ for, what, thousands of years?

ARCHIVIST
But, I mean, hunting, killing each other. That-That’s just how wild animals work. I-I-It’s… natural.

GERARD
So’s death. But we’re still afraid of it.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose. And again, when an animalistic fear touches a human…

GERARD
You get the Predator’s granddad out there.

ARCHIVIST
[Considering] This is, uh…

No, I don’t have time. Tell me about the rituals.

GERARD
Well, they all have one. Most of them, anyway. Takes centuries to build up to a level of power where they can try it, and if they fail, it’s back to square one.

ARCHIVIST
Okay, but what do the rituals do?

GERARD
They… kind of ‘shift’ the world, just enough for the Power to come through. Merge with reality. Some say, or well, they guess, that it could bring other entities through with them. I mean, I doubt The Buried would be bringing through The Vast, but you know.

ARCHIVIST
But what does that actually mean. F-For the world? ‘Merging with reality’?

GERARD
Okay, well… You know how I was just talking about the Hunt and the Flesh?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

GERARD
Well, think of it this way: right now all the entities have to act like a hunter, they pick off the weak ones around the edges, the ones that wander too close, and the rest of the time they have to just graze on whatever fear we all passively give away.

ARCHIVIST
And if one of the rituals succeeds?

GERARD
The world becomes a factory farm.

ARCHIVIST
…

Why would anyone want that? I-I mean, there are people, or they used to be people, who are trying to do this. Why?

GERARD
I dunno. Power, maybe? Or they’ve just got close enough to their patron or whatever that they also feed on it. I guess maybe some people just have a weird relationship with fear.

ARCHIVIST
And Gertrude wanted to stop them.

At any cost.

GERARD
She worked out they’d all be happening quite close together. She’d already been doing it a while. And the Unknowing was the next on her list. That and the Watcher’s Crown.

ARCHIVIST
The what?

GERARD
Uh, the Rite of the Watcher’s Crown. It’s what she called the ritual for the Eye. She didn’t tell me much about that one, just that she knew how to take care of it. To be honest, when she was going through this stuff, that was about the time I thought I had found Leitner, so I wasn’t much in the mood to listen.

ARCHIVIST
Leitner?

GERARD
Yeah. Gertrude reckoned he was alive somewhere.

Said she thought she’d found him. I tracked him down, but it… well, it wasn’t him.

ARCHIVIST
Y-You’re sure?

GERARD
It was just some pathetic old man. Couldn’t have been him. He was so scared of me, I just… just let him go.

ARCHIVIST
Are you alright?

GERARD
I think… I think I’m ready to go. I’m done. Hide my page, and when you’re out of here, burn it.

Please.

ARCHIVIST
I will. Thank you, Gerard.

GERARD
Gerry.

ARCHIVIST
What?

GERRY
Gerard was what my mum called me. [Embarrassed chuckle] I always wanted my friends to call me Gerry.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you, Gerry. Uh… I dismiss you.

[RELIEVED SIGH AND STATIC]
Oh.

Alright.

Well, mine’s a flight back to London. I-I-I think you said that would be a problem for you, you two?

You’ve already done… so much more than enough.

JULIA
Yeah well, you brought us Max Mustermann’s head. I think we’re going to have a lot fun with that. Plus, if you do save the world…

I suppose we’ll call it even.

[EXHALED BREATH]
[Adopts ‘Archivist voice’] Statement of Lisa Carmel, regarding –

[Normal voice] No. Statement of Lisa Carmel, regarding her involvement in a series of murders. Statement number 0111311, 13th November, 2011. Basira Hussain recording.

Statement begins.

BASIRA (STATEMENT)
Okay, I know how it sounds, but Murder Club wasn’t supposed to be like this. It was just true crime stuff. My boyfriend, well, ex-boyfriend, used to call it my “serial killer fan club”, which I’ll admit doesn’t make it sound a lot better, but you’ve gotta believe there was no way any of us would have chosen to get involved in anything like what’s happening.

Except, I guess, that we did. Somehow.

I’m not a violent person, not at all. My sisters used to play-fight when we were kids, and I’d always just… I’d end up crying in the corner. But for some reason, true crime never had that effect on me. Or maybe it did, but I kind of liked it when I could control it. I remember when I first got the taste. I stumbled across a book on famous murders that had somehow ended up in our school library. I read about Lizzie Borden, feeling the breath catch in my throat, and I put the book away quickly before literally running out of the library. I didn’t sleep at all that night, but I still went back to that book the next day.

It’s always scared me. That’s the thing. I could never get into horror; ghosts and monsters always left me bored. Even thrillers never really got me in the same way. But there was just a part of me that always knew it wasn’t real, it never happened. But true crime? The awful stuff that humans do to one another? That got me. I used to think it was about facing the darkness, and coming to terms with my fear, or somehow honouring the victims, but it’s not. It’s just that there’s a part of me that gets an awful little buzz from it. From that shudder that goes through my body when I’m getting all the gory details of how someone died at the hands of a real-life human monster. Books, podcasts, documentaries, I… I went through all of them all, and still wanted more. And then I found Murder Club.

Well, it’s more that I founded Murder Club. Co-founded, at least. And Murder Club wasn’t an official name or anything, it’s just what we called it. We all met through one of those meetup websites, I-I forget which one. It was about three years ago, and I’d just moved to London, so… I tended to trawl a bunch of them to try and find things to do, places I might make some new friends. This one was advertised as the first meeting of a “True Crime Discussion and Reading Group”, and as you might have guessed by now, that was right up my street.

We met up, had a great time discussing a book on Tillie Klimek, and decided to make it a regular event. Pretty soon Murder Club was meeting up every other week. A few of us wanted to do it weekly, but Jamie was a slow reader and didn’t think he could keep up. We’d occasionally all see each other outside the regular meetings if we were watching a new documentary together or something like that. Once, we even went on a day trip to the True Crime Museum in Hastings.

Let’s see, at the moment it’s me, Jamie Sanders, Ananya Kaleka, who we were all founding members, and then there’s Ananya’s wife Evelyn, Andrew Cochrane, who I invited him from work, and Debbie Truss, who joined us about a year ago, but… I don’t remember where from. There used to be more, but people… come and go. So, six of us at the moment. Well, I suppose three. Evelyn, Jamie and Debbie are already dead, so I don’t know how much you’d call them ‘current members’, but you know what I mean.

I really don’t know how it all happened. This ‘jump’ from morbid book club to actual murder came so quickly. This time last week I was finishing up a memoir by a retired FBI profiler, getting ready for Murder Club the next evening; now I’m here, trying to explain things to you in case the others get to me. Probably putting you in danger as well, to be honest, so… sorry about that.

That was the meeting where everything went wrong. It was at my flat – I technically only have a room, with the rest of the place shared between a rotating cast of whatever international students and burnouts my landlord rents to. But that night I had the flat mercifully to myself. I opened the windows to let out the smell of smoke, turned on a small space heater to help with the chill, and laid out a couple of bottles of wine that I bought special.

Jamie turned up first, as usual. He has an obvious crush on me, but he’s also about ten years older than I am – was ten years older – and I just wasn’t into him. Still, he was nice enough company, and we’d usually chat until the others arrived. Ananya and Evelyn were next, and then Debbie. Andrew was late, but it was because he’d been whiskey shopping, which he explained was apparently a thing, and he was in a sharing mood, so we managed to forgive him. We all had our little pre-club catch-up, talking about life and work and the state of the world, and we were just about to dive into the main discussion, when there was another knock at the door.

[KNOCKING AT THE DOOR]
BASIRA
Ah.

[DOOR OPENS]
Oh, hiya Daisy!

DAISY
Come on.

BASIRA
Um, I’m kind of in the middle of something.

DAISY
Well, finish up. Sims is back. Wants to talk to everyone.

BASIRA
What? Since when?

DAISY
[Impatient] His flight got in a few hours ago.

BASIRA
And he called you?

DAISY
No. Elias sent me to pick him up. Didn’t want him grabbed again.

BASIRA
Again?

DAISY
You coming?

BASIRA
Well, not yet. I’ve got to finish here first. You go on ahead.

…

Daisy?

DAISY
Fine.

[DOOR CLOSES]
BASIRA
Okay, where was I?

Right, okay, statement continues.

BASIRA (STATEMENT)
– we were just about to dive into the main discussion, when there was another knock at the door.

There was a quick look of confusion that passed between us all, and my heart sank, assuming one of my flatmates had returned earlier than promised. I was dreading an awkward Lithuanian math student sitting in the corner with a glass of orange juice, staring at us as we self-consciously talked about… decomposition rates and timelines. But those worries vanished as soon as Jamie opened the door. The person who stood on the other side of it was definitely not one of my flatmates.

The first thing I noticed was the height. They were well over six foot, and the top of their head disappeared above the door. The second thing was the mask, pure white polystyrene, and cut into the rough shape of some kind of demon or wolf. The third thing I noticed was the knife.

Jamie noticed it too, and leapt backwards just as the figure lunged towards him. Suddenly everything was moving. Everyone was on their feet, shouting as the figure lumbered clumsily inside, swinging wildly at everyone who got near. I dashed to the small kitchen, and reached for a knife of my own, never taking my eyes off my target. It was a strange thing to watch. I would have expected everyone to be running; Evelyn and Debbie both had a clear path to the open door, but instead we were all just watching, keeping as much distance as possible, occasionally making a motion to disarm him, staying just out of the blade’s path. As I reached for another knife, I found myself tapping my foot, as if to music.

Our attacker was starting to slow now, his movements becoming laboured, his lunges predictable and weak. When he swung at Andrew, his blade went too wide, and he overbalanced. Ananya didn’t waste a second, dropping down and kicking him hard in the back of the knee. He fell like… like an ancient tree, and his head slammed into the corner of the old wooden coffee table with a nasty thud. It tore through the thin grey string that held the mask in place. He lay there motionless.

The face underneath was nothing special. A bald man, maybe forty years old? None of us knew him. He wasn’t an infamous murderer, or someone with a personal vendetta; he was just a man who came to my home to kill us. Everyone had gone very quiet, but it wasn’t like a silence of shock or terror. It was more like a heavy silence of waiting for something to happen. Of expectation. Debbie finally spoke up, saying we should call the police, but she was lying and we all knew it. I looked down at my hands, and realised I’d picked up six knives from the kitchen drawer. Two were chef’s knives, three were for vegetables and one was a battered old bread knife. All of them were sharp enough to do the job, even if I still hadn’t quite figured out what the job was.

I walked slowly over to the unconscious figure on the floor. The others all leaned over him, inspecting their prize. I swear Ananya was licking her lips. When I reached them they all turned to stare at the blades in my hand, and one by one they took whichever knife spoke to them. I ended up with a vegetable knife, one of the smaller ones, but wickedly sharp. I can show it to you if you like.

We all stared at each other for a long few seconds, waiting, like there was going to be some invisible signal. And apparently there was, because all at once we descended, stabbing and slicing and carving and cutting, blood dripping and spraying up in tiny bursts as our knives worked on him. I don’t know exactly when he died. Maybe he was dead already when his head hit the table. It doesn’t matter. It makes no difference to what happened.

And when it was over, we just stood there, satisfied, basking in what we’d done. Like the warm glow of an approving parent, tinged with a bloody sweetness. Or the feeling after a heavy but delicious meal, where you want nothing more than to sit and enjoy how full you feel. When Andrew suggested he get rid of the body, no-one thought to object. He and Jamie dragged it out, I assume to his car, and that was that. I guess they must have gotten rid of it. The police certainly haven’t come round asking about a corpse. Not that I’d know if they had, I guess.

The others drifted out at their own pace. They didn’t need to say goodbye. They… didn’t need to say anything. We understood each other perfectly. I wandered dreamily into my bedroom, and fell onto my bed.

I was woken up by a pounding on my door. It was Matis, my flatmate, clearly angry and not a little alarmed at the mess in the living room. His face went pale when he saw I was streaked with gore, and he just kept asking, “Is it blood? Is it blood?” I didn’t really know what to say to this, so… I just nodded, and he took a few steps backwards, then he turned and walked away unsteadily. I thought about following him, trying to explain what had happened at Murder Club, but there didn’t seem much point. Poor Matis would never understand. At best he could only watch from the sidelines, getting a… a sad vicarious thrill from crimes he was too cowardly to even consider. But I was better than that. I am better than that. I’m beyond.

I went back into my room to change into clean clothes. There was no need to announce my intentions to the world, and… the others would certainly be waiting. I took my small knife and tucked it away. I thought about testing it on Matis, but there was no way he would have been able to understand what was happening.

I first paid a visit to Andrew’s house up near Hampstead, where I was told by his upset mother that he wasn’t home. She said he had left abruptly, and had shoved her aside when she asked where he was going. As she said this I spun around, suddenly afraid I had left myself open, but the street was empty. I didn’t even notice Andrew’s mother slamming the door. I retreated to the shade of a tree to think about my next move. For some reason, the memory of the whiskey shop that Andrew had talked about the day before pushed into my head, so I smiled, and took off at a sprint. I’m sure it would have been quicker to take the Underground or a bus, but I craved that run through the cold November air, my blood pumping and my teeth sharp.

I arrived at the small Camden whiskey shop too late. Andrew wasn’t there, but apparently Debbie and Jamie had had the same idea as me, and they’d met outside the shop. If I were a betting woman I’d have put money on Debbie, and I’d have been right. She was the sort of big with real strength behind it, and she had used it to put her bread knife all the way through Jamie’s throat. She looked up from the body and saw me. And as soon as our eyes met, I knew the chase was on, and this time I was the prey.

I fled, ducking through alleyways and market stalls as she ran after me. She had the edge in strength, but I was quick, and found it easier to slip through the morning crowds. I had a close call near Camden Lock, but I managed to lose her, disappearing up towards Holloway.

And the last five days have been more of that. I caught Evelyn alone two days ago on a bridge near Leytonstone. She almost threw me into the traffic below, but… instead I stabbed her four times in the chest, and my little vegetable blade found her heart. Andrew managed to lure Debbie into an ambush just outside my flat, of all places, even though I haven’t been back since the last Murder Club. Which, I rather think will have been the last Murder Club.

And I was thinking, yesterday, how strange all this was. And it occurred to me that, while it might seem ridiculous, maybe there was something supernatural about all this. Maybe the chase isn’t as normal as it feels. Before we killed that man, I don’t think any of this would have felt right. So I thought I’d come and talk to you, before it all comes to an end. So, sorry if Andrew or Ananya attack anyone here because they saw me come in. I don’t think they will, they’re usually pretty careful, but still. I think that’s all of it, really. I’m probably going to leave now, try to hunt down my friends. It’s weird, you know? I don’t remember feeling this way when we first set up Murder Club. But… I suppose at least we don’t have to change the name.

BASIRA
Statement ends.

Damn. I remember this case. It was a bit before my time, but yeah. Six, um, ‘friends’, they basically spent about two weeks murdering each other before the last survivor was finally caught. Ananya Kaleka was apprehended just after she cut Lisa Carmel’s throat in an alleyway near East Croydon station. The way the other officers told it, she never said a word except to plead guilty, and died in her cell a few months later. Apparently she just… stopped.

I don’t know anything about any assailant in a mask, though. That’s not a part of the story I’ve ever heard before. You don’t get a great description in this statement, but it might be worth checking missing persons for that period, checking any violent offenders that might have disappear –

[KNOCKING AT THE DOOR]
[Sighs] Come in, Daisy.

[DOOR OPENS]
DAISY
You done?

BASIRA
Yeah, let’s go.

DAISY
No need.

BASIRA
Um…?

DAISY
He’s gone. Heading over to some storage unit. Says it’s important.

BASIRA
Oh, so are we going to meet him there, or…?

DAISY
He asked for someone to stay back, distract Elias a bit. I said we’d do it.

BASIRA
Both of us?

DAISY
Yeah. Couldn’t find Tim, but he’s gone with Martin and… the other one.

BASIRA
Melanie.

DAISY
Sure.

BASIRA
I mean, it might be dangerous.

DAISY
They’ll be fine.

BASIRA
Is… Is there something wrong, Daisy?

DAISY
[Quickly] No. So… how’s your new job? Working a lot of overtime?

BASIRA
It’s, uh… alright, I guess. Once you get used to constantly feeling like you’re being watched. Just a bit of low-level dread. Kinda peaceful. Been reading a lot.

DAISY
Mmm.

BASIRA
How about you?

DAISY
Elias is keeping me busy. Hunting. Takes a while. [Falters] I’m used to working with a partner.

It’s fine.

BASIRA
Daisy…

DAISY
It’s fine.

BASIRA
Right. But it’s not, though, is it?

DAISY
You’re getting comfortable with all those books. Don’t forget why you’re here.

BASIRA
I know where I am, Daisy, and I know that I’m a prisoner.

DAISY
And you want to escape.

BASIRA
Yeah. But not on my own. We’re working on something. I’ll ask Melanie to fill you in.

DAISY
Fine.

…

Maybe you could ask Elias if you can join me on a case?

…

BASIRA
How does it feel?

DAISY
What?

BASIRA
How does it feel when you make a kill?

DAISY
[Wary] I don’t know. Good. Why?

BASIRA
I don’t know, it doesn’t feel like… “the warm glow of an approving parent, tinged with a bloody sweetness”?

DAISY
Don’t.

BASIRA
What?

DAISY
I’m not one of your bloody puzzles.

BASIRA
I’m sorry. I just… I worry.

DAISY
Worry about yourself. I’m fine.

BASIRA
Are you sure? ‘Cause you look…

Are you sleeping?

DAISY
Yeah.

…

Do you still have the dreams?

BASIRA
Um, no, not really. Not since we joined up here, I don’t think. You?

DAISY
Yeah.

BASIRA
They’re getting worse?

DAISY
No, not, it’s just – Doesn’t matter. We need to decide what to do with Elias before the others get to Hainault.

BASIRA
Daisy.

DAISY
I’m thinking a fire.

BASIRA
Maybe something a bit subtler? A problem in the break room?

DAISY
I could beat someone up?

BASIRA
Maybe. Anyway, do you want to, um… I could do with some air.

Oh, you know Gertrude. If something’s worth doing, it’s worth… looking through two dozen unmarked cardboard boxes for.

So, you actually met vampire Trevor then?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I, I met… quite a few people from the statements. You remember, er, Dr. Elliott’s statement? The anatomy students trying to pose as people, who definitely weren’t people?

Oh… y-yeah.

So… how was it?

ARCHIVIST
Ah?

MARTIN
America? And China? I’ve never really actually done any, you know, travelling.

It’s not all that. Sometimes you get shot by a ghost.

ARCHIVIST
And refuse to give a statement about it.

MELANIE
Yup!

ARCHIVIST
It was nice, Martin.

[Reconsiders] It was… weird. Paranoia is an odd combination with culture shock. Really rather disorientating.

MARTIN
I mean… it wasn’t actually paranoia, though, was it? Because, they were out to get you.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose that they were.

MELANIE
Wasn’t a great time back here, either.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, god, Melanie, of course. I’m… I’m sorry. If I’d known that Ivy Meadows was –

MELANIE
What?! You’d have told me? Let me learn from one of your statements instead of from Elias? I don’t see that changing anything.

ARCHIVIST
Even so, I… am… I’m sorry.

MELANIE
I don’t need your apology. Or your pity.

ARCHIVIST
Of course. [Then much quieter] Of course.

Martin’s plan is solid. I think.

MARTIN
I mean, they might just kill him.

MELANIE
Good.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, maybe. But… I think they’re still our best chance. Even if we did manage to blindside him, I-I don’t know how long we could… hold him.

MARTIN
And, in fairness, he’s happy enough to use the police against us.

ARCHIVIST
Quite. And I’d rather not be staring down a kidnapping charge on top of everything –

MELANIE
[Urgently] Uh, John?

ARCHIVIST
Yes?

MELANIE
I… I think I found that gorilla skin you were talking about….

ARCHIVIST
Perfect! Er, now if we could just –

MELANIE
Or, I’m afraid… uh, what’s, what’s left of it.

ARCHIVIST
Oh.

MELANIE
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
So… she did destroy it.

MELANIE
Apparently.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[SOUNDS OF BOX LATCHES BEING UNDONE AS THE ARCHIVIST SPEAKS]
So if that’s… not what we’re looking for…

MARTIN
J-J-John, John!

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
I think I’ve found it!

ARCHIVIST
W-Wh-What is it?

[MELANIE CACKLES]
MELANIE
I think you’re gonna want to see this!

ARCHIVIST
Good lord! Is… Is that…?

MELANIE
Looks like it.

ARCHIVIST
Where the hell did she get this? I –

Martin, don’t touch it!

MARTIN
Sorry!

ARCHIVIST
Is it… stable?

MELANIE
How should I know? I don’t even know what kind it is!

ARCHIVIST
I mean, it looks like… C4?

MELANIE
Are you just saying that because it’s the only plastic explosive you’ve ever heard of?

ARCHIVIST
Well, I mean, that is to say…

MARTIN
– so many others –

ARCHIVIST
M-Martin! Stop trying to touch the plastic explosive!

MARTIN
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

MELANIE
Guys…

ARCHIVIST
Just put your hands in your pockets, or… something…

MARTIN
Look, I said, I said I’m sorry…

MELANIE
Guys!

ARCHIVIST & MARTIN
What?

MELANIE
Do you hear that?

MARTIN
Hear what?

ARCHIVIST
Oh…

MELANIE
It’s like…

ARCHIVIST
Oh goddammit…

Oookay.

MELANIE
Is, is that…?

[UNZIPPING OF A BAG]
MARTIN
[Explodes] What were you thinking bringing that along?!

ARCHIVIST
I just – I mean – I forgot!

MELANIE
[Indignant & furious] You forgot?!

MARTIN
[Screeching] Turn it off!

ARCHIVIST
I am! Just give me a second –

MELANIE
[Clenched teeth] Turn it off!

[Deep sigh] Statement of Adelard Dekker, regarding the near death and subsequent activities of Justin Gough. Statement undated, likely circa 2012. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Gertrude,

It should all be here, though god knows I was tempted to take a block for myself just in case. I won’t even press you for where you got it, though if some of these leads pan out I might need to ask you to track down some more. I assume whatever surveillance meant you needed me to move it, is only keeping track of you, but let me know if there’s anything I need to be on the lookout for. Anyway, you owe me a favour. And… maybe another one once you read this. It might come to nothing, but it’s something you should probably be aware of. I’ll even make it a statement. Give your patron something to keep it satisfied. It’s not like I sleep enough to worry about dreams.

I was pursuing my researches into the new emergence I mentioned earlier. I know you are dismissive of the possibility, but if I’m right, the sudden urgency of these “immediate dangers” you are so focused on could very well be a direct result. But that’s for another day, as this particular instance turned out to be unconnected. The point is, I was alerted to a series of deaths by a coroner friend of mine.

Although all signs pointed to carbon monoxide poisoning, the bodies showed signs of acute distress. The sort you don’t normally get when you die in your sleep. There was blood pooled in the back of the throat, and the vocal cords were shredded, although no neighbours reported hearing a sound. And most importantly, at all three scenes there was evidence of a second person who had apparently left without suffering any ill effects. The deaths were about a fortnight apart, and when the third came in with the same symptoms, Bianca, the coroner, called me in. For the last few years we’ve had an… arrangement. I slip her a bit of cash to feed a nasty habit she has, and if she’s called to any inquest which looks strange, I’m the first to know.

Despite her weakness, Bianca is still a damn good coroner, and filled me in on the details quickly. The deaths had been carbon monoxide, she said, and by way of example showed me a plastic cup full of blood. It was bright red. “Cherry red”, Bianca told me, a good sign of CO poisoning. But apparently they hadn’t found any trace of the gas in the homes of the deceased. Current theory was that someone was deliberately gassing people while they slept, but Bianca was adamant that, as far as she could tell, it seemed to have bypassed the lungs completely, appearing right into their blood as carbohaemoglobin or whatever. From the look on their faces I could tell two things. It had hurt. And they had never woken up.

You see why I thought this might be related? Well, hoped more than thought, maybe. The man-made nature of it seemed like a potential link, but it had few of the other hallmarks. Still, I thought it was worth following up on. Finding who was… killing these people in their sleep.

It’s odd, isn’t it? Sleep. That you can never remember or fully pin down the exact moment you lose consciousness. Just lying there, waiting to find yourself in a dream without the first clue or interest in how or when you got there. Or to find your eyes closed and force them open to sunlight and morning, only realising that sleep has happened in retrospect. I wonder if… death is the same way? No clear dividing line, just… gone, only to realise after it’s happened, except for the fact that there isn’t an after. Is that a comforting thought or a terrifying one? Depends on who you are, I suppose. It bothered me when I was young. If I thought too hard about the concept of sleep, of exactly what it was, I would worry myself, and end up having to turn the light on, and read for an hour or two. Everyone always talks about how they want to die in their sleep, but honestly, I think that’s the death that scares me the most.

But that’s a meditation for another day. As far as these deaths were concerned, I was confident there was something turning up in people’s houses and doing this to them. My first thought was a direct manifestation, but the more I looked into it, the more I suspected maybe it was some poor soul who got in too deep. I don’t know if my little ‘theoretical’ is strong enough yet to start taking avatars, but this one, as you’ve no doubt guessed, turned out to be Terminus.

Justin Gough, his name was. He was admitted to Accident and Emergency at Whipps Cross Hospital about two months ago, suffering from – I’m sure it will come as no surprise – acute carbon monoxide poisoning. He had been camping, and taken a small barbeque into his tent to keep warm. And it… warmed his lungs all the way to the hospital. He was terrified and unintelligible, and then he died. For fifty-two seconds. According to the duty nurse, that is how long Justin Gough was clinically dead, before they managed to restart his heart and get him on a breather machine.

It’s hard to scream with a breathing tube in you, but apparently he gave it a noble attempt when he woke up. The nurse I talked to hadn’t been there, but he had apparently had some sort of near-death experience, and had been describing awful visions to those attending him, muttering obliquely about “terrible things” he’d had to do to return, and prices that would need to be paid. None of the staff who were present would willingly say much more about it, but it had clearly shaken them.

Justin Gough was discharged shortly after, and in rapid succession quit his job, disappeared from social media, and cut off effectively all human contact. He became, to all intents and purposes, a recluse who hasn’t left the house since. Or so the neighbours would say. I had a suspicion that he was leaving, but by night, and for a single, very specific purpose. To pay a debt. While many fall to the Powers through love or terror, sometimes it can be as simple as what you owe. After all, most debts are paid out of fear.

The hospital refused to give me his address, but I managed to acquire it anyway. His building was a squalid little apartment block, in such a state I found it hard to believe that he’d had to go camping in order to get poisoned. The windows were well-barred against intruders, and I didn’t think this was a situation where I could simply knock on the door. So I waited. For two days I sat there, watching the damp eat away at the bricks of that half-rotten building. I was all but ready to write it off, and look for another option, when at last the front door opened and out stepped Justin Gough.

Now, I didn’t have a picture of the man, and had been intending to go on the description given by the hospital workers, but in the end I recognised him simply by the thin trickle of cherry red blood that rolled slowly down his chin, and the fact that, as I watched him descend the steps of his building and walk out onto the pavement, I am quite sure that I did not see him breathe.

He was not a tall man, but his frame was rail-thin, and what face I was able to make out was gaunt and hollow. We’ve both seen our share of bodies, Gertrude, so you will understand what I mean when I tell you he had the ‘eyes of the dead’. They moved and they focused, but that subtle glimmer that shows life was wholly absent. All that was left was a skittish sort of terror, as he glanced over his shoulder, desperate to see if he was being followed, and of course overlooking me completely.

This worried me. As you know, I am not by any means a Hunter, and if Justin Gough was as far gone as he appeared, it was likely he was no longer human enough for me to remove him without the aid of one. And while I do know one or two I believe are touched by the scent of blood, they are… unpredictable, and I was reluctant to call on them in any but the most dire circumstances, which I did not believe this to be. So I simply followed him, hoping to get slightly more of an idea of exactly what he was doing.

His walk had a certainty to it. I never once saw him consult a map, or pause to consider his destination. He knew exactly where he was going, and his steps were slow and implacable. There was… an inevitability to his movements, and I think that is when I realised he was simply serving The End, which I won’t pretend wasn’t a disappointment. But still, I thought if I could deal with him and save a few lives, I might as well.

He walked for some hours, until finally coming upon a small house down a cul-de-sac near Hackney Wick. It seemed… unremarkable, and had nothing to distinguish it from those that surrounded it. He walked up to the door and pushed it gently. It opened silently, and he walked inside. So I waited a minute or two, watching for any movement within, listening for any sound that might break the still, humid air. But there was nothing, and I followed him inside.

Justin Gough was sat in the main bedroom. His back pressed against the wall opposite a bed, where a middle-aged man lay sleeping. The room was quiet, and at first I thought there was no movement at all, but as I watched, I saw the face of the man in the bed contort and spasm, as though racked with awful nightmares, his chest heaving and convulsing as he struggled to breathe. I looked to the man I assumed to be his assailant, but to all appearances, it seemed like Justin Gough was also asleep, sat in the corner of that nondescript suburban bedroom. But then I saw his eyelids flicker, and I realised what was going on.

What is the line between a near-death experience and a dream? Perhaps you do leave yourself, brush against the afterlife and return, but… I don’t believe it. I believe they are both simply the firings of a brain we no longer have control over, and perhaps if you make contact with something terrible in one, it continues to live with you in the other. And perhaps it demands you infect others with your fate.

I was not quick enough to save the man who lived in that house. Truth be told, I didn’t especially try. I didn’t think I would be able to move quick enough to do so, and was more concerned with being quiet and thorough. The cutlery drawer was largely empty, but after a minute’s searching I did find what I was after: a long, metal skewer.

Did you know there are certain forms of brain injury that cut you off from your ability to dream? Ironically enough, it’s sometimes caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, but there is still no definitive answer about which part of the brain needs to be injured for it to happen. So I made the decision it was better to be on the safe side, as I pushed the point up past his eye, sliding it into that little gap between eyeball and tear duct, and up into his brain.

I knew it wouldn’t kill him, he’s too far from human for me to do so, but I thought that scrambling his brain a bit was probably my best bet. And I was right, as far as it goes. He survived what I did to him, and when the police picked him up after an ‘anonymous tip’ about a break-in, he was barely able to speak, and I very much hope I managed to sever his dreams.

I have no interest in pursuing this further, but given the mind’s remarkable aptitude for healing, not to mention the resilience of creatures like him, I cannot make any guarantees Justin Gough will remain in the state I left him. And it seems that, as he deals in dreams, it may be worth your while to keep an eye on the statements you take, in case he finds his way here. I’m sure you can take care of yourself, of course, but I thought it would be worth letting you know. Good luck, Gertrude. And enjoy the fireworks.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

This was found tucked into a hard case containing… many blocks of plastic explosive, kept by Gertrude Robinson in a storage unit that I can only assume has… extremely lax oversight. It is unclear if she ever read it.

You know, after my conversation with Gerard, I, I actually thought I was starting to get a handle on everything, how it works, the connections between it all. It is… strangely reassuring to have a statement where, once again, I find myself having… remarkably little idea what it’s talking about. Justin Gough was clearly an avatar of The End, but… I have no idea what else Dekker was alluding to.

So Gertrude knew Adelard Dekker as well? I wonder, is there anyone connected to the supernatural that she was not on first-name terms with? I suppose if you spend fifty years as the focal point of horrors, eventually everyone ends up knowing you. Or dead. Or… both.

I know there are more important things to be doing, but I did ask Basira to have a quick search for Justin Gough, see what might have happened to him. There are records of his residence in an East London care facility until 2015, when he disappears from their records. Several deaths among the staff apparently occurred at roughly the same time. And it will come as no surprise that the inquest returned a verdict of carbon monoxide poisoning in each case.

I’m not too concerned, to be honest, my dreams are, uh… well, let’s just say I don’t think they’re going to be letting anyone else in any time soon.

Statement of Anya Villette, regarding a cleaning job on Hill Top Road. Original statement given April 22nd, 2009. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I don’t know this place. They said I should come and talk to you. A few people did. People I thought I knew, but they were different. I should know this place, I think. I used to go to the Tate a lot when I lived in London, and I, I passed the building, but… I don’t know you people. Nothing makes sense anymore.

It was meant to be just a quick job. Since the divorce I’ve been back working as a cleaner, and for the last month or so John Hector Lettings in Oxford have been bringing me in to get student houses ready for next year’s occupants. It’s not always pleasant work. After all, students are not exactly careful tenants; I’ve had to spend more than one afternoon scraping and repainting bedroom walls for some soon-to-be-dropout that turned the room into a hotbox. But it pays the bills. Barely.

I guess this is why I was so keen when I got the call about Hill Top Road. A nice, simple job. No pulling out instant noodles from behind the oven. No post-grad party gunk to find behind the sofa. Just a newly built house that needed a good clean once the builders were finished. Hoover up some plaster dust, wipe down the counters, a bit of polish on the metal fittings… easy. If there were already beds in there, maybe I’d grab a quick nap, make up for all the unpaid overtime I’d had to put in steam cleaning the last house where some of them had made active use of the bedroom. All told I thought it was the break I’d earned, and not a moment too soon.

It was raining when I pulled into the house. Not heavy, but the sky was that soggy grey that lets you know the weather isn’t changing anytime soon. As a rule I don’t mind the rain too much, but there was nothing relaxing about this weather. No regular thump of droplets tapping on bin lids or windscreens; you just ended up damp and grumpy. I’ve been thinking back, trying to remember if I got any kind of… sense about that house. Whether the windows were darker than they should have been, or if the frame of the place was… heavier. I don’t know. Hard to tell, I was too busy trying to manoeuvre the keys without having to put my bag down on the waterlogged path. It wasn’t until I actually got through the door that anything seemed to be at all wrong.

Even then it was only small things. Easy to ignore. I’m not superstitious, never used to be at least, so how dim the lights were made me think the owners were cheap; maybe they’d decided to go all-in on those weak energy-saving bulbs. The cold? I just thought it was an empty house that hadn’t turned the heating on yet. The small movements of the dust covers… that was the first thing that actually caught my attention.

The owners of the house had already filled it with furniture. Not good furniture, of course: just the cheapest IKEA had that wouldn’t collapse under the weight of a textbook. It was all assembled, though, and… covered with thick sheets of white plastic, to try and keep the dust off. Not a strange sight in my line of work, so I just ignored it, and headed down to the kitchen to start wiping down the surfaces.

I don’t know why I always like to start in the kitchen; it sort of feels like the heart of a home, at least to me, and I like to begin there and work outwards. Or maybe I just like food, and by the time I start on a job, I’m usually already hungry for lunch. That said, the sort of houses I usually clean, I’m more likely to lose that appetite when I stumble on something in the kitchen. This one was already almost pristine, though. A bit of dust on the surfaces, some careless flecks of paint was the worst I had to contend with. Even the oven was spotless and new.

But as I was wiping down the sink, I sort of zoned out. The window in the kitchen looked out over the garden, and… I froze as I noticed that in the centre, there was a tree. It was still bare from the winter, and from the top of it, there were these eight thick branches, just stretching out at all angles, some… reaching up to the sky, and some… it felt like they were reaching towards me. It was almost black against the dark grey sky, and the rain made it shine. My mouth was dry, and I suddenly had this… vision in my head, of walking out the back door, and standing at the base of that tree, as those branches bent, and snapped, and came down to grab me. But I was in the kitchen, and I was still dry. I finished up quickly, and headed off to do the rest of the house.

I tried to ignore it, just told myself I was having a weird bit of paranoia. Getting myself worked up over nothing. I don’t believe in ghosts, you know, and even if I did, it was a new house. It’s not like anyone’s building over ancient burial grounds in East Oxford. But even then I was finding it hard to ignore the movements. Slight rustles in the dust sheets that covered the furniture. Shadows they made that didn’t… quite work with the shape they should be. Or this lump or angle, sometimes, so I’d wonder if they were just covering chairs. Whenever I turned around I swear I heard them shift, and when I looked back, I can’t be sure, but I think they would be different, covering something different. I never got the nerve up to take any of them off, though. I just pressed on, tried to get the place clean and finished as quick as I could. Living room, bathroom, upstairs bedrooms… it was almost getting dark by the time I was finished.

It was such a relief as I started to pack up my bag, and I was just about to zip it closed when I remembered the cupboard under the stairs. It hadn’t been included in the job list, but in most houses I cleaned I liked to give the storage spaces a bit of a tidy and a vacuum as well. It was always brought up by my employers as ‘evidence of my thoroughness’, and I took a lot of pride in it. But in my hurry to be finished and out of Hill Top Road, I hadn’t even checked it. I looked at the small door, then back to my half-zipped bag, and… I decided to just take a quick look. Just a quick look. It was a new house. How dirty could it be?

Obviously it was my decision. I remember the little handle was warm. I don’t know if that’s just my memory playing tricks on me, but I do remember that. It opened to reveal stairs going down into a basement. Nobody had mentioned a basement. Not when they gave me the job, not on the floor plan they’d given me; I’d had absolutely no idea it was there. I found my legs were shaking as my brain pushed forward one question over and over: do they expect me to clean down there?

I decided, again, just to have a look. Just a quick look. See if there was anything down there that did need my attention. Maybe it was already spotless, or maybe it hadn’t been tanked, and was still just bare brick and stone, too raw for me to do anything with anyway. I just had to check.

It was warmer down there, warmer every step, and I found myself brushing cobwebs from my face as I got further down, until at last there I was – stood in the cellar of Hill Top Road. There was just a very quick second of relief, of letting my breath out. I saw how damp it was, full of unfinished brickwork, definitely not something any estate agent would expect me to clean. And then I noticed the crack.

It seemed to split the floor right down the middle; it was jagged, vicious, like something had torn out the ground with a hook. It was maybe a foot across at its widest, and so dark inside it made my teeth ache. I’m not sure how I saw it. Thinking now I know that there wasn’t any light down there, but… that horrid gap was clear as day, darker than just the simple lack of light that surrounded it. And then I was at the edge looking down, and those eight spindly arms reaching up to pull me in. I couldn’t have screamed even if I wanted to.

I woke up in one of the chairs, the dust cover clinging to me like a cocoon. I threw it off, and ran out of that house, and I haven’t been back. But now… everything’s wrong. I went to clean that house on April the 23rd, 2009 which, according to all of you, is tomorrow. But it can’t be. That was two weeks ago. I’ve tried to talk to my friends about it. Those of my friends I can find, but they seem distant, like they don’t really know me. Everything is just… wrong. I can’t find my favourite coffee shop. And I don’t know who you people are.

ARCHIVIST
Statement ends.

Interesting. I’m not really sure what to do with this one. Martin brought it up, said he’d found one that related back to Hill Top Road, a thread that’s been nagging at me for a while, but… I mean, it seems straightforward enough, except… that it never happened. As far as I can tell, Anya Villette doesn’t exist. John Hector Lettings does seem to be a real estate agent’s in Oxford, but according to our enquiries they’ve never employed anyone by that name to work as a cleaner, nor are they currently responsible for the infamous house.

Basira found a couple of possibilities online that might have been her, but the two that almost matched, both professed complete ignorance to any of this. As far as we can tell, the house has no estate agent looking after it, and no current owner. Certainly no plans to lease it to students. I’ve half a mind to just go down and have a look at it myself, but… I don’t know. Ever since it first came up I’ve felt like it would be… just a very bad idea.

We’ve been trying to get a closer look at the documents, figure out who technically owns the place, but… it’s been over a year, and we’re still waiting. Haven’t really had the time to foll–

[FAINT METALLIC NOISES]
Ah…

[THE ARCHIVIST TAKES A DEEP BREATH]
[SOUND OF WOODEN BOARD BEING MOVED ASIDE]
ARCHIVIST
Hello, Tim.

TIM
Oh god…

ARCHIVIST
Come in, please.

TIM
[Sigh, then faux-polite] Good to see you, Boss.

How’ve you been?

ARCHIVIST
I’m not going to lie to you, Tim. It’s been a difficult few months.

TIM
[Deadpan] Good.

ARCHIVIST
And h– I would like to hear how you’ve been doing.

TIM
Me? Oh, I’ve been just fine. I’ll see you later.

ARCHIVIST
You’re sure? You’ve not – There is nothing you want to say to me.

TIM
Nothing with that thing here, no.

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] Interesting.

What do you think is listening?

TIM
What?

ARCHIVIST
[Strongly] What do you think is listening to the tapes?

TIM
Don’t do that.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

TIM
Don’t!

ARCHIVIST
Sorry, I didn’t –

TIM
And you know what I think. It’s that… the thing that runs the Institute. “The Watcher” or “The Eye” or whatever.

ARCHIVIST
I dis… I disagree. This whole place is a temple to The Eye, Tim. I don’t think the tape recorders make any difference.

TIM
[Viciously] Elias, then.

ARCHIVIST
In that case we’ll stick to talking about things he already knows.

TIM
Why are you so set on having it running?

ARCHIVIST
I…

Look, if you want my honest opinion –

TIM
I don’t.

ARCHIVIST
Whatever is on the other side of those tapes is just as invested in stopping the Circus as you are in avenging your brother.

TIM
…

You listened to it, then? My statement.

ARCHIVIST
I listened to all the tapes. I, I had no idea how much of a… a mess I left this place in, I-I-I’m sorry.

TIM
Bit of an invasion of privacy.

ARCHIVIST
I assume that’s a joke?

TIM
[Bitter laugh] Isn’t it just?

…

How did you know I was going to be here?

ARCHIVIST
Th-The others haven’t seen you in weeks, and you’ve still been using the computers here, accessing files and books… I know there are some exits to the tunnels outside the Institute, so I guessed you were using them to get in and out, avoiding any… tape recorders.

TIM
Okay, whatever. But how did you know I was going to be here, now?

ARCHIVIST
…

I just… did.

TIM
“You just did”? Great. Buy one spooky telepath manager, get one free, is it? Fan-tastic.

ARCHIVIST
That’s not what this is.

TIM
[Angry] Oh, and how about you read my mind now?

ARCHIVIST
Tim, that isn’t… I can’t.

TIM
‘Cause I can give you a clue. It ends in “off”.

ARCHIVIST
I… I assume you’ve been doing your own research into the Circus and the Unknowing. I would like to pool our knowledge.

TIM
So why don’t you ‘Archivist’ me, then? Just pull it straight out.

ARCHIVIST
Because I don’t want to. I am not your enemy, Tim.

TIM
[Dismissively] Like that matters. These things aren’t human. It’s… instinct. You can’t not.

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] I’m still me, Tim.

[TIM HUFFS]
I’m still me.

[TIM EXHALES DEEPLY]
TIM
…

You know what? You’re actually right.

ARCHIVIST
What?

TIM
You’re the only one.

ARCHIVIST
I – S-Sorry, I do-don’t follow.

…

Tim?

TIM
Do you know why I avoid the others?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, y-you said, the tapes…

TIM
No. How can I be sure who they are?

ARCHIVIST (BACKGROUND)
Oh…

TIM
You know how long that thing pretended to be Sasha?

ARCHIVIST (BACKGROUND)
Oh god.

TIM
And I had no idea? I knew Sasha for years, we…

I don’t know Martin as well as I knew her. I barely know what Melanie and Basira look like. Or that weird murder-cop. How the hell am I supposed to be sure of any of them?

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] Tim, I… I didn’t realise. I-I didn’t think.

I’m sorry.

TIM
I mean, there’s worms and hallways and clowns, and… In some ways it doesn’t even register. Like, just another spook. But I can’t trust them. I’m going to destroy the Circus that took my brother, and I can’t trust them to help.

ARCHIVIST
And me?

TIM
[Snorts] Well, if you’re trying to spy on us, you’re doing a pretty shitty job. You haven’t been here for months.

ARCHIVIST
That’s not fair! Sometimes I was kidnapped.

TIM
Which is not a good look for a spy, is it?

ARCHIVIST
Fine.

TIM
Anyway, you’re a spook too now, aren’t you? This place loves you too much to let you get swapped.

ARCHIVIST
What about Elias? Surely he’s the same?

TIM
Oh, yeah. Great idea. [Sarcastically] Let’s just all trust Elias.

ARCHIVIST
Point taken.

TIM
[Sigh] Screw it.

…

I know where they’re doing it. Th-The ritual. And I think they’re almost ready.

ARCHIVIST
R-right. Where?

TIM
In the House of Wax, in Great Yarmouth.

ARCHIVIST
Ohhh… I thought it might be there, but th-the others, we, we couldn’t find any evidence of, of movement or, well, life.

TIM
I had to wait almost two weeks. But it’s there.

ARCHIVIST
Why do you think they’re doing it so soon?

TIM
Skin. That’s what they need right? They tried to take yours.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

TIM
Well, last week they went on a couple of field trips to a pair of cemeteries.

ARCHIVIST
Who did they take?

TIM
New graves. No flowers. The first had a name on, no dates, no inscription. “George Icarus”.

ARCHIVIST
I, I don’t know the name. Who was the other?

…

Tim?

TIM
Gertrude.

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] What?

TIM
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I… I thought she was cremated?!

TIM
I guess not.

[THE ARCHIVIST EXHALES DEEPLY]
ARCHIVIST
So they did get an Archivist’s skin after all.

TIM
[Snidely] So, what’s the plan, Boss?

ARCHIVIST
Heh. I, er… I think you’re going to like it, actually.

TIM
[Unconvinced] Oh yeah?

ARCHIVIST
Should be quite… cathartic. I just need to… confirm a few details.

TIM
Fine. But you don’t cut me out!

ARCHIVIST
I won’t.

TIM
I –

ARCHIVIST
I promise!

Now, um, if you’ll excuse me.

TIM
Oh, er… er, right.

[Contentedly] Yeah. I reckon I can.

ARCHIVIST
Good.

DAISY
So, do you have a plan?

ARCHIVIST
Um… We’re working on it.

You think she’s found him by now?

DAISY
Maybe. Maybe he’s not watching anyway.

ARCHIVIST
I-I just… I feel safer if I think he’s distracted. Is the… the rest of it…?

DAISY
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
And Martin… he’s okay with it?

DAISY
It was his idea.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. You think it’ll work?

Statement of Mikaele Salesa, regarding an antique meat grinder in his possession during the autumn of 1999. Original statement given January 4th 2007. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
So it’s another statement is it? Like I owe you something? Even though I warned you the handle might have splinters, that you should always be wearing gloves if you’re going to try firing it. And you knew where it was from, the signs of rage and violence to be watching for. So far, I don’t see how it’s my fault, and I don’t consider myself liable.

That said, I don’t want you thinking I don’t appreciate you keeping it quiet. You all have been one of my most stable customers, and I’d hate to sour the business. So I suppose if it’s a statement you’re wanting… it’s no inconvenience to me. I don’t sleep well anyway.

So what’s it going to be? Could go over what got me started in the business; that’s a story I haven’t told you yet. Though there’s less in the telling than you might expect. My first job was working with Jurgen Leitner, but I got out of that years before the man met his fate. Started looking for the exit about the time that I saw Warren get literally eaten by a book. And before you start cross-referencing, looking for some newly-birthed monster called Warren, I don’t mean eaten like that. It left behind the leg. Don’t know any transformations that leave behind your leg.

So I gave Leitner my walking papers, and struck out on my own. I had no intention of following in his footsteps with the books, and when I began it was just normal, high-end antiques I was moving. Leitner’s client list, which I’d taken the liberty of copying, did me proud. The man had a knack for sniffing out moneyed fools with no sense of the value of things. Combine that with my own skill at evading a lot of the ‘legal entanglements’ the trade can get caught up in, and making money was not much of a challenge. Once or twice one of them would try to sell me a book, but when I learn a lesson, I learn it to my bones.

After a while, some of those familiar with Leitner and his library approached me with some of the more… unusual items they had locked away. The sort of thing they’d have sold to him if they’d been bound in paper, rather than ceramic or wood. I didn’t want anything to do with them, not to begin with, but you’ve seen for yourself that the artefacts are not so volatile as the books, and they fetch a pretty penny, so eventually I started dealing in them as well.

So there’s that. But I don’t think that’s the sort of statement you’re after is it? No. You want something a little ghoulish. Something to stick your teeth into. Fine. I’ve got one. You see, in this game there are a few rules it’s a good idea to keep to if you’re looking to stay alive. One of mine, is that only I take stock of the merchandise. You want to know how I came by this rule? I know you do.

So there was a man worked on my ship. Let’s call him ‘Cook’. Not his real name of course, but real enough for this and, thinking about it, it’s unlikely he signed up with his real name anyway. Now, Cook, his main job was what you’d expect: working in the galley to keep my small crew fed. But on a ship like that, all of you pitch in all of the time, even me, and cooking a few meals a day doesn’t stop you having other duties. And one of those duties was checking on the cargo, making sure none of the breakables had managed to, wel , break. Any other crew I’d have been worried about theft, but I’d been with most of these for two or three years, so there was plenty of trust there.

This must have been some time in September, back in ‘99, and for most of the journey Cook had been checking on the merchandise with no problem at all. But on the last week or so of that voyage, he’d been taking longer and longer, and it was starting to affect meal times, and so on one of those occasions I made my way down to check on him. And, of course, I found him staring into one of the boxes.

The item in question that we were transporting for sale was an old antique meat grinder. The sort with a heavy vice you clamp on the table, and a nice big crank for twisting the screw, push the meat from the funnel along and into the mincer. It was a rusty old thing, all heavy iron and brand names worn away to nothing. If it wasn’t for the fact that it was near two hundred years old it would have been more valuable as scrap. Even with the age I wasn’t confident we could shift it. Without looking at my records, I couldn’t tell you where I picked it up, and I’m sure it wasn’t pointed out to me as one of the weirder items. No warnings or nothing like that.

But Cook, he couldn’t get enough of it. He was staring at the thing, a look of longing in his eyes. With another decade under my belt, I now know how stupid my next action was, but I used to consider myself someone who looks after my crew, and Cook seemed real taken with the thing. I honestly wasn’t sure how well it was going to sell anyway, so I named a fair price and offered to take it out of his wages if he wanted to claim the grinder for his own. He said yes immediately, and was mighty thankful of my generosity. He grabbed the thing like it weighed nothing at all, which was the first clue I took proper notice of, and sprinted off to make lunch.

That night dinner was hamburgers. I made a joke to Cook about him getting good use out of the meat grinder already, and he laughed, told me it was from frozen, but looking back now I don’t think he laughed as long or as hard as I might have liked. The meat was good, juicy, and honestly it didn’t taste as if it had been frozen at all. The sausages the next night were the same.

Cook was different as well. Whenever I passed him I got a little bit of a smell. Like a raw steak just hitting the grill. Not an unpleasant smell, not at all, but certainly one I’d never noticed on him before. Occasionally, if he was wearing white, I could see small spots or smears of blood just at the edges. It might have been his own, working on a ship you get your share of cuts, but after a couple of days it became a little bit on the… unnerving side. He smiled more as well, and I’m not sure, but I feel like that might have been the thing that tipped me off the most that something was up with him. He’d never been the sort to… smile.

The meaty dinners kept coming, and I began to wonder a bit about where he was getting it all. I talked to Leigh about it, who generally deals with supplies and acts as a sort of quartermaster, and she told me she’d definitely stocked up on plenty of canned and frozen meats for Cook before we set out, though only he’d been keeping track of what we actually had left. But it wasn’t that I thought he didn’t have the meat available, it’s that I just didn’t know how he seemed to make it all taste so fresh. By that point I was pretty much convinced that whatever was going on with Cook was outside the area of the natural, and that usually traced back to one of the items I was carrying for sale. The fact that I’d just given something to Cook, well it tracked too closely for me to not come to some… obvious conclusions.

I started to avoid eating the meat I was served, kept my feeding to the small portion of vegetables that he’d add to the side, more a garnish than anything else. It didn’t escape my notice that Cook was also hiding increasing amounts of his arm inside his coat when he spoke to me. First fingers, then the hand, then final y he kept the whole forearm tucked under his jacket so I couldn’t get a decent look. When I thought about it I’d get visions of Cook slowly reaching in, cranking the handle wildly with the other arm, while he pushed his skin and flesh into the whirring iron, mouth open and smiling, as it began to come through the mincer grate like a string of meaty bubbles. It made me feel ill, but I just couldn’t get it out of my head.

So a few days out of port, I snuck into the galley when he wasn’t in. I mean, it was my ship, so I shouldn’t have felt like a thief sneaking around, but I did. Secured over the hobs was a bubbling pot of water that Cook was gradually turning into stock. At first I didn’t know what it was that made me so uncomfortable about the sight. Then I realised that he was making it the same way you make most meat stocks: he was boiling up some bones. And I am a hundred percent certain that Leigh did not supply us with bones, especially not the sort of bones I was seeing in that pot.

The meat grinder was there, clamped onto the side, a ways away from the main counter, and with no sign that it had ever been used. But there was something to it that alarmed me. When it had been in the box it was old, rust creeping at the edges. Not something you’d want to put raw meat through. But now the thing was spotless, like new, and as I got closer that… same smell that wafted off Cook got stronger and stronger.

Now I’m not one for hiding, or dodging a confrontation, but if this was happening like I thought, I really wanted to catch Cook in the act, see exactly what he was doing. So I went, and I waited until he was in the kitchen, preparing dinner, and I just walked in. Well, I tried to walk in, but Cook had locked the door. I had my own key of course, but I was also aware of how flimsy the lock was, so in the interest of time, I just kicked it open.

In many ways, what I found in there was exactly what I expected, but in other ways… I don’t know. Cook did have his right arm up to the elbow in the mincer, his left hand working the crank, around and around. I could hear the sound of bone and flesh grinding, but there was nothing coming out the other end of the machine. Then I saw what was lying on the counter. It was his arm, neatly sliced off and butchered into cuts of meat, the bone shining white through the blood and dark skin. And I remembered he’d promised us pork chop tonight.

Looking back at Cook, I saw the ecstasy on his face, with just a hint of manic terror, as he turned the crank, and a new arm came out, bit by bit, raw and glistening. It didn’t look like his old one, but there was a part of me sure it would taste just the same.

It didn’t look like he’d even noticed me breaking through the door. He was wrapped up in his own sickness. So I walked over and grabbed him by the shoulder, screaming to know what the hell he thought he was doing. That snapped him out of it alright, and he lunged at me with a sudden cry, ripping the lower part of his arm back off, and leaving it sitting there, ragged in the grinder. His left hand went to the boiling stock, blistering and peeling as Cook reached in and pulled out one of the larger bones, swinging it wildly about the place. I don’t speak any Croatian, but given the way he was salivating I’m pretty sure he was chanting something about dinner.

But in the end, he only had one arm, and wasn’t thinking properly. His movements were clumsy, like a drunk, and even at his best I’ve killed worse than Cook. He went down easy. That’s another good thing about having a crew you can trust. They tossed him overboard, and cleaned up without asking any sort of prying questions. Of course they belly-ached about another week on canned food, but I think they understood the alternative would have been worse.

Story has a happy ending, though. I managed to sell the grinder to some rich Canadian gourmet, who I assume was bored of the standard options for his meals. Didn’t even have to leave anything out. Of course, he disappeared about a year later, and they never found the body. But there’s no way to prove that had anything to do with me. Besides, it’s not like he was paying me in instalments.

ARCHIVIST
Statements ends.

[DEEP SIGH]
I suppose in some ways it’s strange I’m not a vegetarian yet, what with everything I know. But… I rather think someone in my position has to take their small pleasures where they can, and if it occasionally delights some grotesque meat-god, well… c’est la vie.

So Salesa was one of Leitner’s old assistants. That makes some sense, I suppose. The sort of small revelation that a month ago would have filled me with wild conjecture. Now it seems, I don’t know, almost trite. Filling in the puzzle, but not touching on those parts of the picture I still don’t understand.

Maybe it’s not that. Maybe it’s just this… stillness, the anticipation. I – We know what’s happening, we know what we have to do about it, we even have something approaching a plan for once. And while it’s a welcome change not to be desperately praying for a deus ex machina, I don’t really know how to handle the waiting. Whatever Elias has Daisy doing, it seems to be working. Nothing’s made a move on me or the Institute since I returned, and last time I saw her there was the distinct smell of burnt plastic. So I suppose I’m safe. But everything just feels like… killing time, running down the clock. I don’t think I like it.

God, do I – do I miss being chased? That’s depressing. No, it’s… I just miss feeling like I’m moving, like I –

[Sharply] What do you want?

HELEN
Not sure. To talk.

ARCHIVIST
You’re keeping her face, then.

HELEN
I am Helen.

ARCHIVIST
Don’t pretend to be people I know. Knew.

HELEN
I’m not pretending.

ARCHIVIST
You’re not Helen Richardson.

HELEN
I wasn’t Michael, either.

ARCHIVIST
Who do you see? When you, you look at yourself? There are mirrors in those corridors of yours. What do you see?

HELEN
I don’t.

ARCHIVIST
…

Why are you here?

HELEN
I… I’m not… I’m not entirely sure. I’m… having trouble. I don’t think I was meant to be Helen.

ARCHIVIST
I’m – I don’t understand.

HELEN
Neither do I. Michael was… pulling away. His anger was interfering. I don’t, I don’t think I have a choice but to be Helen. Self is difficult.

ARCHIVIST
Michael, he, uh, he, he wasn’t meant to be you either, though, was he?

HELEN
No.

ARCHIVIST
…

So…

[Slowly] Why are you here?

HELEN
I took someone.

ARCHIVIST
You t–

Wh… L-Like Michael ate you?

HELEN
I took a man, wandering the halls of an old tenement. He’s dead now, he never even came close to finding me. It was nourishing, but…

ARCHIVIST
But…

HELEN
I didn’t like it.

ARCHIVIST
You d– [Sigh] I’m not sure I follow.

HELEN
I feel… wrong. I feel this –

ARCHIVIST
[Angry] Why are you telling me this?!

HELEN
Something happened when I became ‘Helen’. She wasn’t right, she wasn’t ready.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t…

HELEN
Before, talking to you made Helen feel better.

ARCHIVIST
You’re not that Helen!

HELEN
I just want… I just want to feel better.

ARCHIVIST
…

I don’t believe you.

HELEN
You don’t?

ARCHIVIST
Wh-what? Why should I believe… a-a-any of this? You’ve told me over and over that you’re… what was the phrase? The ‘throat of delusion’? All of this is –

HELEN
I have never told you a lie, Archivist. I wouldn’t dare. I, I just thought you might understand.

ARCHIVIST
Uh… How could I possibly…

HELEN
We’re both changing, Archivist. I had hoped, that together –

ARCHIVIST
[Furious] Get out.

HELEN
Archivist…

ARCHIVIST
Get. Out.

HELEN
Fine.

What do you want?

ELIAS
To help. Do you have your recorder running?

DAISY
‘course he does.

ARCHIVIST
I… yes.

ELIAS
Well, then, I’ll speak clearly. You will soon be attempting to stop something few have ever witnessed and fewer still have survived.

ARCHIVIST
Not alone.

We’re, um, I think we’re all going.

ELIAS
Yes. And I believe your plan – um, simplistic as it may be – does have a reasonable chance of working.

ARCHIVIST
Well, thank you.

Sorry, sorry, did we… I thought we’d only actually got as far as, well, we sneak in, plant bombs, when they’re… distracted?

ARCHIVIST
Detonate them when the ritual starts; they’re vulnerable.

I mean. I’ve got some plans of the museum, and the area around it, but, yeah. That’s. That’s it.

DAISY
It should work. It doesn’t need to be fancy.

ELIAS
Well, quite. But given there is every likelihood but some or all of you might end up confronting the Stranger in a rather direct manner, I thought it best you have an idea of what you might encounter.

BASIRA
Oh.

GERTRUDE
Case 7870211. Abraham Janssen. Incident occurred in the Court Theatre Buda, October 1787. Statement taken from journal entry, dated the 2nd of November of that year. Committed to tape on the 4th of October, 2013. Gertrude Robinson recording.

GERTRUDE (STATEMENT)
Some months have passed now since the sights and sounds that excited in me that unknown and hideous mania. Yet still my hand shakes in the writing of it, such that I can scarce understand myself the marks I leave upon the page. I would hold myself the most ill-used of men, were I not certain of others who left that theatre with wounds far graver than a tremor. I curse the name of Wolfgang von Kempelen and all his vile machinery, and there is no greater hope within me than that I should never again be required to lay eyes upon the Mechanical Turk.

I have always refrained from writing of it, but some years ago, at its creation, Kempelen prevailed upon me to play the Turk myself. I agreed, considering it a grand old joke, and a worthy use of my aptitude for chess. And some aptitude I had, indeed. In my youth, I even played a match against Philidor himself, in Old Slaughter’s coffee shop, though he thrashed me soundly.

Most who would dismiss the Turk as a simple ruse or deception would posit that only a child could have crawled inside the base of it. But, at almost half a century, I was quite delighted to work my way between the gears and play the venerable puppetmaster to Wolfgang’s infamous chess-playing automaton.

Most who would discover that a human mind directed the Turk found that fact cause enough to dismiss the marvel of the thing. But to do so would have been a grave disservice to Kempelen’s singular skill. For, though I may have chosen the movements, and played the game that unfolded above my head, the motions of the machine were the result of an ingenious array of gears and mechanisms that I could never hope to understand. It was an astounding feat of engineering, even if the mind behind it could not be replicated by clockwork and springs.

At least, not when it was first constructed.

I must not, however, allow my regard for Wolfgang’s intellect to distort the most appalling horror that his creations precipitated upon that stage. Nor to hide his complicity and guilt in what occurred.

He was a strange man. For as long as I knew him, his manner caused me disquiet, and I attribute the continuation of our acquaintance in no small part to our difference in language. We had some commonality in French, but I often felt there to be much nuance in his words that was simply not conveyed between two men, neither of whom was speaking his mother tongue. Indeed, on some few occasions when I observed him conversing in Hungarian or German, the expressions I observed upon the faces of his interlocutors were invariably those of discomfort or alarm. Wolfgang von Kempelen had within him some strange dream, I think. Some secret ambition, that might be glimpsed when his eye fell upon his automata. But it always eluded me.

Our initial meeting was civil, even pleasant. He had by then completed his construction of the Turk, and had requested several of his compatriots to seek out those who might have some small skill at the game of chess. I was at the time traveling in Austria, and introductions were made by a mutual acquaintance by the name of Lanthorn. Wolfgang explained to me the concept. That I would be secreted within the base of the machine, and direct the figure on how to play the game taking place upon the table. I agreed almost immediately.

Perhaps I would have had more reservations, had I known the unveiling would take place before the Empress Maria Theresa. Or if, when I agreed, I had actually laid my eyes upon the Mechanical Turk.

What description of it should I give? Should I speak of its costume, the rich Ottoman colors, lined with fine fur? Or the dreadful stillness of its dark shining face, the unmoving painted eyes that met mine and could not see me recoil? The torso simply ended as it disappeared below the table, and when I held my nerve enough to climb into the tiny chamber below it, some small part of my soul cried out that I was devoured within the belly of the cruel device.

Despite this, our exhibition to the Empress was a triumph, and I retreated from it both elated and utterly unsuspected. Indeed, such was the breadth of my success, it carried me through another year, traveling with Wolfgang and operating the Turk. I will not pretend that there was no joy to be had in my position; both displaying the marvelous engineering, and using my own prowess at the game of chess to fool great crowds of onlookers. Yet even then, nothing could fully quiet that odd anxiety I felt when I looked upon the Turk. Nor the strange and intricate dreams I had of it.

But eventually, my business in London required my return, and Wolfgang had other projects to which he wished to devote his attention. Most notably, a grotesque speaking machine, that he insisted would someday be capable of mastering human speech. I saw many of his designs. The bellows that aped the work of lungs, the wooden box of valves and pipes, and that most grotesque mouth he had constructed of some awful undulating substance he claimed was derived from an Indian tree. To dissuade him from his conviction that it would someday be capable of rendering intelligible speech was impossible. But hearing the mournful wail that came from the spasmodic thing he called a mouth, I fervently prayed I would never have to be there when it did so.

A prayer that went unanswered.

Wolfgang von Kempelen and his automata were far from my mind when I received the invitation from him, some fifteen or sixteen years having passed since we had any cause to forgather. I was once again in Austria, through coincidence, and received his letter in the dying days of summer, imploring me to attend a grand performance at the newly completed Court Theatre of Buda, many miles east in Budapest. It was not an insignificant journey from Vienna, but Wolfgang’s letter pleaded that I be there. I was, so it would have me believe, indispensable in my attendance, as “the oldest friend of the Turk.”

This line, I will confess, filled me with an apprehension that bordered almost on bone-deep fear. Though at the time I had no cause to heed such a feeling. My reason told me there was nothing to this but an oddly insistent invitation from an old friend, and I resolved to attend, if only to conquer the unaccountable terror that had taken residence within my heart. A terror, I now know, I should have heeded in every respect.

I shall waste no time detailing my journey to Budapest, and all my numerous failures to locate Wolfgang once I arrived. I did make some small inquiries about the court theatre, and learnt something of its history. Namely, that it had formerly been a Carmelite monastery, until Joseph II had had it dissolved three years prior, and commissioned Kempelen to convert it into the city’s first theatre. The cells had now been taken for the actors’ dressing, and the crypt remade into a trap room beneath the stage, which had, itself, been placed where the high altar of the chapel once stood. Perhaps this should have stirred some further apprehension within me. But the changing fortunes of Eastern churches seem so far away from Wolfgang and his strange machines that I paid it hardly any mind.

The date came at last, and it was with no small trepidation that I made my way to the Court Theatre of Buda. No tickets had been issued to me, nor had I seen any way in which they might have been acquired. But upon my approach I noted several other figures, finely-garbed, making their way towards the theatre with the expressions that mirrored my own.

The doors of the theatre were open, and standing at either side of each entrance were things that, on first appraisal, appeared to be men. As I approached, however, I recognized the stiff motions and lifeless faces I had marked so sharply on the Turk. Dressed as gaudy footmen, automata silently gestured us inside, with unnatural jerky motions of their arms and heads, so violent that I would have thought it no surprise had they been hurled from their sockets. More were within, and I was struck by the absence of any flesh and blood ushers. Everywhere I turned, there seemed to be more ticking, whirring figures of clockwork, wood, and metal.

Seeking some reassurance, I tried to make some comment to another guest beside me, but found a cruel brass hand, awful in its strength, gripping me by the shoulder, and leading me away. I was walked to a balcony where I was, I supposed, to be seated. Fearful and confused, I acquiesced to the silent instructions of what I had begun to consider my captors. Even when other, equally-alarmed, spectators were seated beside me, I refrained from addressing them, feeling as I did the unchanging faces of those mechanical beings staring down at me.

Before each seat, there stood a small metal cage, within which hung a minute mechanical bird as might be used to delight children. But the angles of the creatures had been worked to a razor’s sharpness. And there was something in the metal orbs that stood for eyes that I could not bring myself to look at. The theater fell silent every seat filled with quiet watchers, curious as to what might be about to take place, but dreading the answer we were to receive.

Then all eyes fell upon a figure in the center of the stage, and I immediately recognized the Mechanical Turk, sat at its false table. Its head raised itself slowly, shuddering from side to side, and looked out over the assembled crowd. Its coat was not as I had seen it, the fine fur now gone, and in its stead something hairy, coarse, and brown that hung loosely about its shoulders.

There was a single nod, and a crack like brittle steel. And every false bird began to sing. It was not the gentle chimes of a hidden music box. Rather, the horrendous piping wail of creatures in pain, at such a pitch and volume that it seemed no two birds could be anything but discordant. Had I dared raise an arm, I would have covered my ears, but I’m certain that would have been no protection.

As the sound echoed through my skull, I saw the Turk lift something, inch by inch, over its head. A long, curved sword was gripped in its rigid fingers, the point aimed squarely at the chessboard in the table before it. The arm rose as the chirping intensified to a scream. Then came a single, swift downward motion, of such force that it pierced right through the wood, and buried the blade deep into the space beneath.

The birds ceased their infernal chorus for a long moment, as blood began to flow gently out from beneath the base, pooling under that device that had haunted my dreams for fifteen years. Then they began again, louder and more furious than before. At this, the machine moved once more, faster now, and with a shaking and shuddering that did nothing to slow its motion, it placed something upon the table. I saw bellows, a wooden box, and a soft and hideous throat that seemed to twist and pucker on its own.

Then the Mechanical Turk did something that I do not believe will ever fully leave my thoughts, no matter how fervently I might wish it. It stood up. It had no legs, and made no secret of. Yet still it stood, stepping away from the table that was its very being. And it began to dance.

As it did so, the bellows left upon the bleeding table started to pump, and I heard again that mournful wail of Wolfgang’s speech machine, as the end of it flailed and bulged until at last it shrieked its words to the audience. I do not know what it said, and I thank almighty God that I speak no Hungarian.

There was then a moment of absolute nothing, wherein I swear that none of us existed within the world. When I returned to being, the mouth upon the altar was speaking English, but I no longer understood it and I cried to the jailer in a language all my own to let me out of my chair. But the chair was nothing but a stone, and his face was too much of skin not to scream. The wooden man in the seat next to me tried to seize my hand, but I no longer possessed any, so I curled my legs into a fist and struck it again and again until my eyes were full of sweet sherry, and the part of me that sang no hymns bit down and choked upon the soft wood.

I staggered, falling up onto the door, and opening it to a screaming clockwork heart, that begged me to stop as I unscrewed it from its moorings, and set it adrift upon the sky that dropped away before me. Nothing was anything, and nobody was what they did not pretend to be. I desperately wished to cry, but no longer had any understanding of what a tear was.

And then there came a noise I did know. Into the nothing that was everything came a thing that was most clearly a battle cry, though I did not understand the words of it, only the sense.

I looked away to see, inside, a man who was a soldier. I was sure he was a soldier, and he was nothing but a soldier. His blades were blades and forged for killing and his mouth was a mouth and was made to order death. Beside him were four who were also soldiers, though their weeping eyes were empty sockets, and the captain led them by a rope around their necks. They dragged a thing that wasn’t a thing, but instead a mouth upon a tree that hated the Turk and all it brought upon the world.

The soldier carved and cursed its way through a horde of vicious clockwork flesh men, with faces that cannot not have been my father, and shouted a command to the sightless followers that even I understood to be an order of attack. They took the burning sun from their pockets, and placed it upon the tree, and the mouth spat a curse so heavy it flew towards the altar, and struck the Turk square in the chest.

And, in that moment, everything was real once again. The sightless men, and the unknown soldier in his bloodied uniform, turned and dragged the cannon from the theater, paying no mind to the carnage that surrounded them on every side, the limp and unmoving bodies of automata and patron alike, nor the destruction they had wrought upon the stage. The cries and pleading of the wounded and dying rose up like an awful chorus, where before the air had been filled with the piping of metal birds. And, God may damn me for a coward, but I ran.

GERTRUDE
Final comments.

The Stranger and its ritual have proved remarkably hardy in many ways. Resistant to most of the standard interferences, and flexible in such a way that while the Unknowing is relatively easy to delay, full disruption seems borderline impossible. And yet, here we see what I assume to be an avatar of the Slaughter end an almost fully-realized ritual with, if not ease, then, at the very least, a direct simplicity.

Perhaps… that’s it. Could it be that the closer the Stranger comes to emerging, the more damaging a physical disruption to its focus becomes…? And more research is needed, but if that’s true, then the task becomes at once less complicated, and significantly harder. Disrupting the others has been successful largely because I was able to do so before they had reached any form of culmination. And from the description of Abraham Janssen, I would not be confident enough in my senses to attempt something similar once the Unknowing has become in earnest.

Hmm. It could probably stand as a solid Plan B, at the very least. And I might make inquiries about getting my hands on some… appropriate ordinance. This also confirms that they’re still using that ancient skin as a focus item. If it wasn’t destroyed by cannon fire, I imagine it will take some effort on my part to do so, but I’m now sure I know where they’re keeping it. And if I’m able to take care of it, that may buy me a reasonable amount of time to research alternative methods.

All I can say for sure is that when the Unknowing begins, I certainly don’t want to be inside it.

ARCHIVIST
…right.

BASIRA
That’s it, then?

ELIAS
It’s unlikely to be identical. The Stranger is not known for its, um, consistency.

BASIRA
…but something like that? We can’t trust what we see.

ELIAS
The familiar may seem strange, the strange, familiar.

ARCHIVIST
One long category error.

MARTIN
Well, isn’t – I thought that was what the Stranger wants, you know, for us to doubt everything.

ARCHIVIST
No one said it was going to be easy.

ELIAS
Brilliant. I have been doing my best to prepare you, John, to see. You should hopefully have it a bit easier than the others.

ARCHIVIST
[sigh] Another of my “powers?”

ELIAS
More… an aspect of your becoming.

DAISY
You don’t say.

ELIAS
Uh… right. Regardless, it should, I hope, give you an edge. Otherwise, I would never suggest you go yourself.

ARCHIVIST
[sigh] What about Martin?

MARTIN
What about me?!

ARCHIVIST
He should stay behind.

MARTIN
What?! Why!?

ELIAS
[overlapping] Really?

ARCHIVIST
Too many people might attract attention

MARTIN
No, no! I can help! I’ve been reading the statements!

ELIAS
Quite right. Probably best he does stay behind.

BASIRA
What, so you have a backup if John doesn’t make it?

ELIAS
I’m sure that won’t be necessary –

MARTIN
[unhappy noises, overlapping] Hey! Wh-what, what!? No!

ARCHIVIST
Martin, just… you can do more good here.

MARTIN
What, sat around drinking tea until the world ends?! Or, you know, it doesn’t. We hope.

ARCHIVIST
Melanie’s not coming either. I think… I think she’ll need you here.

MARTIN
…fine.

ELIAS
Glad that sorted! Now, unless there’s anything else?

ARCHIVIST
Not if, uh… no.

ELIAS
Excellent. Well, it’s a three-hour trip up to Great Yarmouth. I had Rosie book you all into a bed-and-breakfast near the museum.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

ELIAS
Oh, and, uh, John. Technically, I can’t stop you, but I would heavily advise against bringing any… rogue elements.

MARTIN
You can just say “Tim.”

ARCHIVIST
I will take it under advisement.

ELIAS
Hm. Anyway, don’t worry about staying in contact, I’ll know when it starts.

ARCHIVIST
Naturally.

ELIAS
Oh, that reminds me. Make sure you keep any receipts for expenses, assuming you wish to claim them back.

ARCHIVIST
And assuming we don’t, you know, die.

ELIAS
Yes. If you die, I’m afraid you probably won’t be able to claim your expenses. Now, if you’ll excuse me?

I… would rather have you where I can see you.

TIM
Good.

ARCHIVIST
You listen to the tape?

TIM
Yep. Sounds like fun.

ARCHIVIST
Do I need to be worried about you?

TIM
You reading my mind again, boss?

ARCHIVIST
I’m watching your face. Do you – are you going to keep it together?

TIM
Look. If you’re worried I’m gonna go all… red rum and start hacking up random waxworks, don’t be. I’m not gonna give us away. I want this to work.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

TIM
But I don’t think it will. So I’m gonna take that axe of yours, and when it all goes wrong, I’m going down swinging. And when I do, you’d better take the chance and stay out of my way.

ARCHIVIST
Okay. I’m just… [sigh] Okay.

ARCHIVIST
Statement of Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, London, Regarding the upcoming, um… operation. 2nd August, 2017. Recording taken direct from subject.

I-I wanted to get some thoughts down before, um… everything. We all should, actually. I’ll, I’ll maybe mention it to them.

It looks like it’s decided. Myself, Daisy, Basira, and, uh, Tim are all going to be heading off to this House of Wax. We’re to sneak in as best we can. Daisy will set the charges while we, what was the phrase she used, “run interference.” Then we will set them off once the ritual begins. Gertrude’s notes were pretty clear. Unless the ritual is underway, any damage we do can be easily repaired. But if we time it right, it’ll be centuries, maybe, before they can try again. Of course, if we time it wrong…

Daisy’s been pretty clear that she thinks the best chance of success would be for her to go in alone, and, honestly, I struggle to disagree. But Tim isn’t going to sit home and wait, and Elias seems pretty insistent I go along. Part of me thinks it’s just so he can see if whatever this “preparation” he’s been trying to do on me works. You know what? That same petty little part of me rather hopes it doesn’t. That all this time, all his cryptic nudges and “learn to fly by falling” attitude, ends up being a complete waste of time. Just to show him. Even so, I, I… it wouldn’t feel right to not go.

I think Basira is the same. She’s coming along to back up Daisy, or so she says. I don’t quite get those two. I suppose what they’ve done, seeing what they’ve seen… it’s a hell of a bond. The sort of thing I’ve mostly done alone. Still, it does sometimes make it hard to fully trust them…

You, you know what, no. I’m, I’m done with that. No more paranoia. It’s almost got me killed more than once, and Georgie was right. If I am, uh, slipping then I need people I can trust. And I… I don’t think that can happen naturally for me an-anymore, so I’m making a decision. I trust them. All of them.

Ex-except Elias, obviously, that’s not – I mean – I’ve listened to the tapes. I’ve listened to the tapes, and I know what they talk about behind my back, how much they’ve… suffered because of this place. Because of me. God. Poor Melanie.

And… aside from some, uh, uh, office gossip which I, I’m not sure is necessary or, uh, conducive to a workplace that… hey, it, it, it’s natural it’s, it’s normal. There’s, there’s no there’s no sinister hidden motives or… it’s fine. It, it’s fine.

So, I guess… sometime in the next few days, I go on a commando mission to blow up a wax museum. ‘s not exactly what I was expecting from an archiving job. I do worry about Martin and Melanie, and leaving them behind with… I suppose that’s part of trusting someone isn’t it? Letting them help how they can.

Oh, yeah, I found something on the other body the circus stole [laugh], this “George Icarus.” Apparently he was interred earlier this year. I did a bit of [laugh] digging, and it looks like the plot and the headstone were paid for by… the Magnus Institute! And I can think of only one man who died within the last few months who the Institute would want buried under a pseudonym. Only one who spent his life so close to fear that his skin would be useful in a ritual like this. I don’t know what to actually do with this information, but… god. Jurgen Leitner. I just can’t be rid of him.

BASIRA
Statement of Basira Hussain, 2nd August, 2017, at the request of Jonathan Sims.

I don’t, I don’t really know why I’m here. I mean, I know how I got here. All the decisions I made, until suddenly: yep, this is my life! But not the why. Not really. Does that make sense?

[sigh] I don’t want to be here. But by the end, I didn’t want to be police, either, so, guess I don’t really know what I do want. Which… maybe that’s just as well. My options… they’ve gotten a lot narrower over the last year. I don’t know, I feel kind of bad. Everyone seems to be having a much worse time of it than me, but I was meant to be the hostage. It’s amazing how much you can ignore when you keep your head in a book.

My dad would hate me talking like this. He couldn’t stand people who just passively moaned about their problems. He always said, if you don’t like something, you accept it and you adapt, or you fight and you change it. Whining doesn’t help. I always tried to live like that. But I think sometimes you feel like you’re adapting, but it’s just denial.

But not anymore. I’m going to fight, and change it. I just hope I’m not heading into the wrong battle. I suppose if John screws up, it wouldn’t hurt the others to have a trained pair of hands to help. So, waxworks it is. I just wish it didn’t feel so much like abandoning Melanie. And Martin.

But at least Daisy’s coming. I mean, I know she’s… difficult. Everything they say about her, it’s true, it’s fair. But, she’s solid. She’s a… a fixed point, and if she’s there, I know exactly where I stand, exactly what I’m doing, relative to her. She has no doubts. We go in, we plant bombs, we leave, we blow it all to hell. Or, we die. I don’t think I’ll ever have clarity like that. Despite everything she’s done, she’s, she’s still the best partner I ever had.

[sigh] I just hope John can keep it together. And Tim… gosh, Tim. I know they’ve been through a lot, but they’ve never taken something like this on before. And if it’s anything like what we went after Rayner, it’s going to get bad. The sort of bad you can only get through if you stay focused and keep a clear head. You choke down the fear – and not because it’s feeding some weird horrible god, like John thinks, but because that’s how you keep going.

I guess, I guess we’re all just gonna have to do what we can, and see what comes out the other side. [sigh]

How the hell did I end up having to save the world?

MELANIE
Melanie King, 2nd of August, 2017. 11:23 p.m.

It’s late. I don’t know what time the others are leaving. Might be tomorrow morning, I guess. They don’t really tell me that sort of thing. They’re going to let me and Martin know when they’re ready, when everything’s about to actually kick off. I should probably wish them luck, and hope that there isn’t going to be some kind of horrifying apocalypse, but it’s rather hard to hope for anything at the moment. Hope isn’t really good for anything it’s always been action with me. It’s, it’s been doing things that helps. I’ve never really seen the point of hope.

I know why I’m not a part of this action. I, I do have my own stuff to take care of. They think they’re giving me a chance to face my demons by helping to take down Elias. They don’t get that the only way to deal with something like him is to watch his eyes go dead with your hands around his throat. I’ll play it their way, for now, but when it comes down to it, I want to see him dead.

I, I’m so angry just sometimes, when John’s going off on one about his latest insight, it’s all I can do not to punch him in the teeth. I feel like I’ve always been fighting. No one makes space for people like me. You’ve got to elbow the comfortable idiots out of the way, and then claw your way up with gritted teeth. I’ve had to struggle for everything.

I know it sounds stupid to call starting a ghost hunting show a fight, but it was tooth and nail, and I won. And then I went to that hospital, and I met John, and it all fell apart, but I’m still fighting. For all the good it’s done me. Still stuck, still miserable, still angry. New traumas, but they hurt just like the old ones. Elias thinks he’s got this ingenious way to hurt people, but it’s just the same old bullshit in a creepy new package. God, I just want to rip –

When did I start to lose the parts of me that weren’t just anger? Hmm. So, if you listen to this, John – if you survive – I know you wanted a statement about my trip to India. So, well.

In 1919, British troops massacred almost a thousand unarmed civilians in Amritsar. You know I was looking into specters of war and violence, and I found reports that these soldiers’ ghosts were still manifesting. I did my research, and I figured out where and when I thought it was going to happen next.

I told you what I was doing, and then I went to see for myself. I was right. They did manifest, but they weren’t what I thought they’d be. They were fused, somehow, all mixed together, a huge angry mass of dead flesh and guns. I ran away, obviously. I ran away. It wasn’t like it could chase me. But it turned out their bullets were more solid than I’d have guessed for ghostly antiques, and one of them got me. I had it sewn up at the hospital. Said I’d been mugged, although the scans couldn’t find anything in there.

And then, I came home. So, yes, that’s it, that’s all you’re getting. Because it hurt like hell to live through, and I didn’t do it so you could stroke your chin and call it fascinating.

Good luck, John. I do hope you win. But I also hope it hurts.

MARTIN
Um, statement of Martin Blackwood, on the night of his colleagues’ departure. Statement given direct, August 3rd, 2017. Statement begins.

I, I’m scared, I guess. – no, wait. No, no, I mean, aww, I don’t want that to be my last message, the thing that defines me. “Martin Blackwood, he was always scared, then he died. The end.” I don’t want that.

But it’s true, isn’t it? I mean, if you’re right, if these things out there are eating our fear, then I’m a luxury smorgasbord, I suppose. I’m just afraid all the time.

I know, I know, I’m not gonna die, I’m not even going to be on the incredibly dangerous mission. Me and Melanie, well… I don’t think death is really the worry. It’s just, this feels like an ending? Or, something? Like nothing can go back to normal after this. Hey, hey, I mean what’s normal, right? Is- is living in old document storage normal? Is losing a friend and not even noticing normal? Corridors; evil, all-seeing managers… Suppose you can get used to anything.

But… this feels different. I need them to be safe, I need him to be okay. So-sorry, umm. I’m not afraid for me, though. Isn’t that weird? I mean, it’s not like I’m going to be safe, like my plan’s not dangerous, but it’s, it’s mine. This last couple of years, I’ve always been running, always hiding, caught in someone else’s trap, but, but now it’s my trap, and, well, I think it’ll work. I know, I know it’s not exactly intricate, but it felt good leaving my own little web.

Oh, oh, Christ, I hope John doesn’t actually listen to these. “Good lord, is Martin becoming some sort of spider person?” No, John, it’s an expression, chill out! Besides, spiders are fine. I mean, yes, people are scared of them, obviously, but actual spiders, they just want to help you out with flies.

Anyway, I guess I’m just sick of sitting on my hands drinking tea and hoping everyone’s okay. This way, I finally get to do something. It’s gonna hurt, but I’m ready. And I want to. Also, I get to burn some stuff, so that’s cool! I just really hope everyone makes it back.

And I want to win on my own.

Oh, and I hope the world doesn’t end. Obviously. Just… just don’t die, John. Or, or Tim, Basira, or… Daisy, I guess? Just… everyone please make it back home?

TIM
All right. I don’t know what you are, I don’t even know if you’re listening, I don’t care. Just, if you’re there, I want you to know that I hate you. I hate you for, for witnessing what’s happened to us.

I used to blame my brother for going off his own and poking around where he wasn’t wanted. I used to blame myself for not helping him. But now… now it doesn’t matter. I’ve read through enough of these things to know that this doesn’t matter. The only thing you need to have your life destroyed by this stuff is just bad luck. Talk to the wrong person, take the wrong train, open the wrong door, and that’s it!

I’m gonna hurt them, though. I’m gonna hurt the thing that stole my brother and wrecked my life. I’m the distraction. If it looks like any of the circus folk, mannequins, whatever, are gonna see the others, I’m to make the biggest mess I can, draw them away, keep them busy. [laugh] I know what it means. They gave it to me because they think I’ll get angry and do something stupid anyway. And they’re probably right. So maybe it’s for the best.

You know, for the longest time, I thought the secret was in balance. In some dusty old architect’s work on symmetry. But he failed, didn’t he? What was he even trying to achieve? He lived like anyone else, he died like anyone else. Whatever he was looking for in his “balance and fear,” I don’t think he found it. From what I can tell, there’s only one person who’s ever managed to hurt them – to really hurt them. And that’s Gertrude Robinson. She was cold, ruthless, and she hit them when they were vulnerable, and she sacrificed a lot of people to do it.

Honestly, I hope that John learned something from her because, because I don’t expect I’m going to be coming back from this. I don’t know if I want to. And if he needs to pull the trigger, to use me to stop it… well, he’d better have the guts to do it.

Fire.

ELIAS
And yet you haven’t set the whole Archives alight. So I assume this is… what’s it called. A cry for attention.

MARTIN
Maybe I just thought it might hurt.

ELIAS
No more than you’re hurting yourself by acting out.

MARTIN
Oh, so that’s it, isn’t it. Martin’s just acting out. I mean, Daisy’s a “rabid dog,” and Melanie’s a potential killer, Tim’s a – a rogue element, but Martin, oh Martin’s just acting out. He’ll have a cry, and a lie down, and feel much better.

ELIAS
(done) And if you’re trying to convince me otherwise, then you are failing. Now, if you’re quite done, I am very busy.

Oh, sorry. Sorry, I’m not – keeping you from the show, am I? Well – well you head back. I’ll keep myself busy here. Albrecht von Closen is next, I think.

He’s quite an old one. Should go up very quickly.

Did John put you up to this?

You think I’m doing this for him?

No. It’s just the sort of half-baked scheme he’d come up with, and I am well aware that you’d do just about anything for him.

Oh, no. You’ve made that quite clear.

So what? I don’t get to be angry? I don’t get to burn things? Just, just run around, making tea, while everyone else gets to actually have feelings?

ELIAS
Please get to the point, Martin.

MARTIN
Maybe there isn’t one. Alright? Maybe –

ELIAS
Maybe you’re just wasting my time.

MARTIN
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

ELIAS
I see. That puts me in a… difficult position.

MARTIN
Good.

ELIAS
You might want to turn the tape off, Martin.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. WAXWORKS]
ARCHIVIST
How much longer?

DAISY
(through gritted teeth) I don’t. Know.

ARCHIVIST
The others didn’t take this long.

DAISY
The others had clear structural weaknesses. This room doesn’t.

TIM
How hard can it be to blow up one building? All this… stuff!

DAISY
It depends. Lots of other buildings close around it, I was told to be careful.

TIM
Right. Fine.

BASIRA
So would you say this was supposed to be Churchill or Alfred Hitchcock?

[John lets out a breath.]
ARCHIVIST
Jowls like that, could be either. I mean, the [unintelligible] is a bit – Tim! Leave it!

TIM
We should know what’s going on. How close they are.

ARCHIVIST
We are not ready yet! If you start opening doors and they see you –

TIM
Are you sure it’s through there?

ARCHIVIST
I, I, I, I’m pretty sure. I saw it a few times while I was here, they’ve knocked through most of the middle, ho-hollowed it out, made a sort of auditorium.

BASIRA
How big?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know! Big!

BASIRA
I mean, it’s not a huge building.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. Tonight was my first time seeing it from the outside. At least in the… flesh. I guess it does seem, m, smaller?

[Silence.]
BASIRA
You’re sure this is the right place?

ARCHIVIST
I am. This is definitely where they kept me. Although I don’t remember quite this many waxworks.

BASIRA
Alright. I just don’t want to get this far and find out we’re in a –

[She’s cut off by a strange music seeming to come from the other side of the door.]
ARCHIVIST
This is the place.

[He takes a shaky breath.]
TIM
We need to see what’s going on in there.

ARCHIVIST
Just ignore it. We have a job to do.

BASIRA
Jesus.

ARCHIVIST & TIM
What?

BASIRA
It moved.

ARCHIVIST
Right, okay, if they’re starting to, ah, We’ve got to go.

BASIRA
No, like – it was just – it’s just a flicker in his eyes. Look at it –

ARCHIVIST
Don’t – Look, if the waxworks are coming alive, we need to go.

BASIRA
Just shut up and look.

[Silence but for the background melody as they do.]
BASIRA
Huh.

ARCHIVIST
Oh god… Oh god, they’re not waxworks.

TIM
What do you – Christ.

ARCHIVIST
Tim, I – I think – I think maybe we had better see what’s going on in there.

TIM
Alright. Alright. On three. (pause) Three.

[They open the door. The music grows louder.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh…

TIM
Holy –

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I suppose it is.

DAISY
Done.

ARCHIVIST
I, um. I think we might need all of it, Daisy. This place is, uh, it’s bigger than we thought.

DAISY
Roger that. Give me a couple of minutes.

ARCHIVIST
S-s-sooner would be better.

[He starts breathing faster.]
TIM
What is it?

ARCHIVIST
Fear fuels everything, of course they need it, for a g-grand ritual…

BASIRA
What the hell is that thing? What’s it doing to them?

ARCHIVIST
I, I think – I used to call it The Anglerfish. It’s – I knew it took the skin, used it to coat people made of sawdust and stuffing, but now – I suppose I thought it just ate the rest. But no. It had a museum to fill with waxworks. And I guess you don’t need skin to sing. (shaky breath) To join the choir.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. ARCHIVES]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
MARTIN
Hm. Sorry. Looks like it wants to know what’s going on.

ELIAS
Hm. A pity. You know John listens to all of them.

MARTIN
What, you don’t want him hearing your big evil speech?

ELIAS
Just wanted to spare you the small amount of dignity you have left.

[Martin laughs, but it’s mirthless.]
MARTIN
Dignity? Right, yeah. Like the dignity of being trapped in your flat by worms, or sleeping in the Archives clutching a corkscrew, or, or fetching drinks for the thing that murdered your friend without you even noticing. Laughing, at all their little jokes, then being led to wander impossible corridors for weeks.

ELIAS
(sighing) Are you done.

MARTIN
Not even close. Because, I – (composes himself) I’ve been thinking. It’s not like you got this all-seeing thing recently. You’ve had it the whole time. I remember the way you looked at Sasha after the attack. You knew it wasn’t her. And I reckon you knew Prentiss was lurking under the Institute, too, and you did nothing. Why?

[Beat.]
[Martin slams his hand down onto the desk.]
Why?

[Beat.]
ELIAS
Let’s just get this over with, shall we?

MARTIN
What, like with Melanie? Just that perfect bit of information to leave me a wreck?

[Elias takes a breath.]
ELIAS
Yes.

MARTIN
Well, I hope you’ve got something better than that pathetic dig at my feelings for John.

ELIAS
It’s baffling, really. Such loyalty to someone who really treats you very badly.

MARTIN
Oh, is that supposed to be, what, a revelation?

ELIAS
You know, I really should have gone for that. Found something that would finally manage to shatter that precious image you have of him. But, as you say I am very busy at the moment. So I suppose I’ll have to go with what I had prepared.

MARTIN
Do it.

ELIAS
Your mother. She’s always been… difficult, hasn’t she. You take care of her for years, feed her, clean up after her, and now, with her condition degrading even further, she is the one that asked to be moved into a home.

[Martin sucks in a shaky breath.]
To have it left to the nurses. She’s the one that refuses your visits.

MARTIN
She’s a-always been –

ELIAS
Strong-willed?

MARTIN
Stubborn…

ELIAS
No. No, Martin. You know the reason. Your mother simply hates you. You just don’t know why.

It’s not your fault, though I know that isn’t any consolation. Just bad luck, really. How old were you when your father left? Eight? Nine? When your mother began to sicken, and he decided he was done with you both. Not old enough to remember him with any great clarity, especially when your mother refused to keep any pictures of him. She never recovered from that betrayal. He just tore her heart right out and took it with him.

The thing is, though, Martin. If you ever do want to know exactly what your father looked like… All you have to do is look in a mirror.

[Martin’s breathing grows louder and shakier. There’s a vague static in the background, still.]
ELIAS
The resemblance is quite uncanny. The face of the man she hates, who destroyed her life, watching over her. Feeding her. Cleaning her. Looking down on her with such pity.

MARTIN
(tearful) Shut. Up.

ELIAS
You want to know what she sees when she looks at you?

[Both Martin’s sobs and the static grow louder; Elias is transmitting the memories and images straight into his mind.]
MARTIN
(through sobs) Oh god…

[He continues crying as the static keeps going.]
ELIAS
(hissing) Don’t burn any more statements.

[Elias leaves, closing the door to the office behind him as Martin continues sobbing. He’s doing his best to compose himself, and he manages to do so just enough before the door opens again and Melanie comes in.]
MARTIN
Did you find anything?

MELANIE
Uh, yes, I found –

[She finally looks up and sees the state Martin’s in.]
Jesus. Are you okay?

MARTIN
Do we have what we need?

MELANIE
I think so, yes. He didn’t even have a safe, just a few locked drawers. It was – it was easy.

[Martin takes a shaky breath.]
MARTIN
We need to leave.

MELANIE
We need to kill him. Look at you. He needs to die.

MARTIN
No. No, I – I knew what this was gonna be.

MELANIE
It’s not just for you! If we leave him alive –

MARTIN
Melanie. Melanie, please.

[Beat.]
[Melanie sighs.]
MELANIE
Alright. Let’s get these somewhere safe.

BASIRA
So what do we do?

ARCHIVIST
We can’t help them.

TIM
So, what, we’re just going to leave them to be skinned alive?

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) [And] what do you want me to do?!

TIM
Well, you brought me in as a distraction, right?

ARCHIVIST
What?

TIM
Let me do it. Go in, maybe you can get some of them –

ARCHIVIST
Tim, contrary to what you think, I did not bring you here to indulge your death wish.

TIM
That’s not what this is.

ARCHIVIST
No?

TIM
No! You knew I might not be coming back –

ARCHIVIST
I knew none of us might be coming back, and I’m not going to let anyone get killed for nothing!

TIM
Well, except for those people in there.

ARCHIVIST
They’re already dead!

TIM
Not all of them.

ARCHIVIST
(sudden yell, followed by immediate realization of need to whisper) I am not losing you as well!

BASIRA
[unintelligible, overlapping]… Look. Whatever we’re going to do, we need to figure it out. Now.

ARCHIVIST
Fine.

TIM
Look. John, I –

DAISY
Done.

ARCHIVIST
What?

DAISY
It’s all ready. Here.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. I – I thought you would want to, uh, do the honors.

DAISY
It’s safer with you. You know when it needs to happen.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Okay, um, c-come on, then. Let’s go. (pause) Tim, come on.

TIM
This isn’t right.

BASIRA
At least it’ll be quick.

ARCHIVIST
Tim, please. We have to go –

[The door creaks open. The music is louder, now.]
ARCHIVIST
Get back.

DAISY
Behind me.

[A new static begins.]
NIKOLA
(over speaker) Will the audience please take their positions?

[The static grows in intensity.]
NIKOLA
The show… has begun.

ARCHIVES TEAM
AAAAH.

[The static grows louder. In the background, the circus music intensifies, with a proper melody and beat finally recognizable. Amidst it all is the Archivist’s breathing, loud and isolated against the background frenzy.]
ARCHIVIST
Jesus…

BASIRA
Get the hell away from me!

TIM
Where’s – no!

DAISY
Don’t move –

ARCHIVIST
Daisy! Daisy, i-it’s me!

TIM
No!

DAISY
I said, don’t move.

ARCHIVIST
Daisy!

[CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYS]
ARCHIVIST
[echoing] Hello? I – anyone? What’s – what’s going on? What is this place? Where…

Help? Please? Anybody?

SARAH!NIKOLA
I’m somebody.

ARCHIVIST
[stammering] What? Who are you?

SARAH!NIKOLA
What an excellent question.

ARCHIVIST
You – you stay away from me.

SARAH!NIKOLA
“Sarah”, “Daniel”… sometimes I think I’m just not built for names. A hundred puppets, a hundred pointless names.

ARCHIVIST
I-I don’t understand.

SARAH!NIKOLA
Of course you don’t. You can’t. Not anymore.

ARCHIVIST
What? I don’t… I don’t… who are you?

SARAH!NIKOLA
[chuckling] It’s me, John. It’s Tim.

ARCHIVIST
John. John?

TIM!NIKOLA
Yes, that’s your name, and I’m Tim, your friend.

ARCHIVIST
Tim?

TIM!NIKOLA
Yes. John, you can relax.

ARCHIVIST
No – no, no, no –

TIM!NIKOLA
[overlapping] Everything is going to be alright.

ARCHIVIST
No, Tim, we’ve – we’ve got to stop it.

TIM!NIKOLA
Stop what?

ARCHIVIST
I…

TIM!NIKOLA
And how are you going to stop it?

ARCHIVIST
[stammering] I have, I have… I thought that this, this…

I – I don’t know.

TIM!NIKOLA
Well, don’t you worry. I’m sure we can work it out together.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, yes. Yes – Tim, I just I need a second, to… uh –

TIM!NIKOLA
Of course, John.

ARCHIVIST
John. Yes, that’s – that’s me.

TIM!NIKOLA
Give it to me.

ARCHIVIST
[disoriented] Yes, yes, if you could, I’d – I’d value your input on it…

TIM!NIKOLA
Tim.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, Tim. Tim.

TIM!NIKOLA
Now let’s take a look at this.

ARCHIVIST
Please.

TIM!NIKOLA
Right now, what we have here is our handheld remote detonator.

ARCHIVIST
A what?

TIM!NIKOLA
It talks to a bomb.

ARCHIVIST
Wait. Wait, uh…

TIM!NIKOLA
I imagine if you’d used it, we’d all have come to quite a nasty end.

ARCHIVIST
That was – uh, that was –

TIM!NIKOLA
[giggling] Don’t you worry, Archivist, it’s all in good hands.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t understand.

TIM!NIKOLA
And you never will again.

BREEKON
Hello, Daisy.

HOPE
You alright?

DELIVERYMEN (BOTH)
Daisy?

DAISY
No.

BREEKON
I’m sorry?

HOPE
Don’t follow you.

DAISY
Leave… no.

BREEKON
Come on Daisy.

HOPE
Don’t be like that.

BREEKON
It’s me, Basira.

DAISY
No, you’re not. Because nothing is anything. Leave.

BREEKON
And if I don’t?

HOPE
What will you do?

DAISY
I’ll kill you.

BREEKON
Will you now?

HOPE
Ooh, pretty scary. If you can, that is.

BREEKON
You don’t even know what a gun is.

DAISY
I don’t care.

[SOUNDS OF GORE AND THE DELIVERYMEN GROANING IN SHOCK. DAISY BEGINS LAUGHING.]
TIM
Get away from me!

BASIRA
[slurred] It’s alright. I’m not – I’m not one of them.

TIM
Everyone is, this isn’t – just get back.

BASIRA
Okay, okay who – who are you?

TIM
[agitated] I don’t know, do I?

BASIRA
What can we do?

TIM
It’s too late. There’s nothing.

BASIRA
There must be. We just need to figure this out. I – I know I’m me…

TIM
So what’s your name? Huh? Who exactly is “me”?

BASIRA
Doesn’t matter. Names don’t matter. I just… I know – I know I’m me and I know I’m here.

TIM
Bullshit, “here” is just – [groans]

BASIRA
There’s things that – that they’re not me, they want to hurt me, but. I don’t want to hurt you.

TIM
I don’t believe you.

BASIRA
I don’t want to hurt anyone.

TIM
Get back!

BASIRA
No, we can do this, I – I can do this, I just need you to –

TIM
I said get away!

[SOUNDS OF STRUGGLE AND GRUNTING]
BASIRA
Don’t… wait. I don’t… I don’t understand.

ARCHIVIST
It isn’t – it isn’t real.

NIKOLA
What isn’t real, John?

ARCHIVIST
I-I-I don’t know. None of this is real.

NIKOLA
But it is! Just because you don’t understand doesn’t mean it’s a lie.

ARCHIVIST
Who are you?

NIKOLA
[unconvincingly] Why, I’m…. Tim of course! Who else would I be?

ARCHIVIST
You’re not. You’re not Tim.

NIKOLA
Oh, you caught me! I’m Sasha!

ARCHIVIST
Shut up!

NIKOLA
Really, it’s me! Sasha… whatever-her-name-was! Back from the dead, just like you wanted!

ARCHIVIST
Get away from me or I swear, or I’ll –

NIKOLA
Or you’ll what? Hit me? Go on then, try it – make a fist.

ARCHIVIST
I… I…

NIKOLA
Do you even know which of these hands is yours?

ARCHIVIST
Stop… stop, stand still.

NIKOLA
Do you even know what a hand is?

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
Pathetic.

ARCHIVIST
Wait. Wait, I – I know you.

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
I would hope you do.

ARCHIVIST
How are you here?

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
Don’t be obtuse, John. I’m here because you failed.

ARCHIVIST
I-I tried. I tried, I almost –

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
You almost what? You almost didn’t doom the world? No, you almost let reality be the plaything of a lazy, foolish liar.

ARCHIVIST
No, no – I would – I could have stopped them.

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
How? You didn’t even know what it was. Do you know how many people I killed to keep the world in one piece? The sacrifices I made, and you didn’t even know what you were fighting.

ARCHIVIST
N-no, I didn’t –

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
I suppose it’s of no consequence now, it’s far too late.

ARCHIVIST
What can I do?

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
[gleefully] You can scream, I suppose. Weep, maybe. Have you considered curling into a ball?

ARCHIVIST
Why are you doing this?

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
I’m not. You know, it’s probably for the best I’m dead. Can you imagine how I’d hate having to watch you fumble around as my replacement? I really cannot express how much of a disappointment you are.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry, I didn’t even –

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
I fought for years to stop the Stranger in its tracks, you didn’t even notice when they desecrated my corpse. And now look at me. You’ve made me part of their ritual. This is your fault.

ARCHIVIST
It is not. It’s not, I didn’t know. It’s not my fault you died.

LEITNER!NIKOLA
[distorted] No, I suppose not. Me, on the other hand… that one is very much your fault.

ARCHIVIST
[despairing] No, not – not you as well…

LEITNER!NIKOLA
Oh, yes.

ARCHIVIST
He told… why – why didn’t you warn me it would be like this?

LEITNER!NIKOLA
I hardly had the chance, did I? Before you left me to get my head bashed in. I understand, of course. You needed a cigarette? I suppose you should have remembered that smoking kills. [giggles]

ARCHIVIST
That’s not – I don’t know…

LEITNER!NIKOLA
Come now, Archivist. Surely you know what a cigarette is. Or a pipe?

ARCHIVIST
It’s hard to think.

LEITNER!NIKOLA
If our earlier conversation was anything to go by, I hardly think you can blame your faults on the ritual. Your problems go far deeper than that.

ARCHIVIST
Just – give me a moment, please.

LEITNER!NIKOLA
You think that would help? Honestly, if I wasn’t so dead I’d be impressed. I always thought my own hubris to be quite exceptional, but you’ve managed to somehow deliver more bad decisions into two years than I managed in a lifetime. But by all means take your moment.

ARCHIVIST
What do you want?

NIKOLA
I already have what I want, little Archivist! Now I just want you to join me for a dance!

[JOHN SCREAMS]
[DAISY GROWLS]
BREEKON
You killed him! Do you even know what you’ve done?

[DAISY BEGINS TO LAUGH]
BREEKON
You stupid animal.

DAISY
[growling] Kill you…

BREEKON
No.

[DAISY CONTINUES TO LAUGH]
Shame you don’t know your own coffin. But you will. [chuckles] You will.

BASIRA
[talking to herself] Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Just close your…

[groans] Ignore it. ignore the uh… don’t listen. Focus, think. This is a place. You are you and you’re in a place now. If… if it’s a place, and it’s now, then… then… then it has an end. The other things, the…

[BASIRA GROANS IN FRUSTRATION]
Too much, too much. There’s – there’s too many. and they wanna hurt me so – so… you leave the place. You leave the place and the now. No place is forever. You know how to move, so do it. Pick a where… then the move.

Good! Then – then keep moving. Keep moving until you find another place. A place you know… just keep moving. Keep moving.

NIKOLA
Do you feel it, Archivist? it’s almost there, the new day.

GERTRUDE!NIKOLA
A terrible new world. It is all your fault.

LEITNER!NIKOLA
Though I suppose you never really had a chance.

ARCHIVIST
I see you.

NIKOLA
Do you now?

ARCHIVIST
Yes… yes. I see the sad clown, bitter and hateful. I see him finding his way into the circus where nobody knew him. I see him torn apart, becoming the mask, remade by a cruel ringmaster. Sometimes a doll, sometimes a mannequin, always hiding in somebody else’s skin. Somebody else’s name.

NIKOLA
[petulantly] Not always. And it’s far too late for any of that. Nothing you see can help you.

SARAH!NIKOLA
Not without the detonator.

NIKOLA
Really, Archivist! After all this preparation, all your research! All this magnificent grotesquery, and what – you were just going to blow it up?

SARAH!NIKOLA
Probably the hunter’s idea. She killed one of the couriers.

NIKOLA
Oh dear, how sad.

SARAH!NIKOLA
She was also the one that damaged this shell.

NIKOLA
You have hundreds of shells, Sarah! And soon you will have tens of thousands. You can have your little girl within every dark corner of the whole world!

SARAH!NIKOLA
Not until you finish the dance.

NIKOLA
Oh, just let me enjoy myself for a moment! This is a once in an eternity event after all.

SARAH!NIKOLA
This in-between is not as comfortable for all of us as it is for you.

NIKOLA
Oh, fine. Archivist, it’s been a pleasure but I really must –

[TIM YELLS, NIKOLA GRUNTS]
ARCHIVIST
Wait, no –

TIM
I’ll kill you. All of you!

SARAH!NIKOLA
Will you now.

[SOUNDS OF STRUGGLE BETWEEN TIM AND JOHN]
NIKOLA
Let them fight! It’s adorable!

JOHN
[strained] Wait, Tim! What do you see?

TIM
[angered] I see my asshole boss!

Or – or… wait… wait.

NIKOLA
[displeased] Spoilsport.

SARAH!NIKOLA
Tim.

TIM
[snarling] Grimaldi.

NIKOLA
Once. A long time ago, before Orsinov made me. And sometimes, even now, for special occasions. Like your brother. [distorted] SHALL I?

ARCHIVIST
Tim, what’s in your hand?

TIM
[strained] It’s… I don’t… The detonator.

NIKOLA
That’s quite enough from you, I think.

[JOHN YELLS]
And now you.

TIM
Go on, I’ll race you. See if you can do it again before I can squeeze.

SARAH!NIKOLA
It’s too late.

NIKOLA
The world is ours! That toy won’t help you now.

TIM
So come and take it.

[PAUSE]
That’s what I thought.

NIKOLA
I am losing my patience.

TIM
Back! Get back. That’s right.

John. I don’t know if you can hear me, but if you can… then I don’t forgive you. But thank you for this.

NIKOLA
You idiot! Do you really make the world will fare any better under the Watcher? You think you’re saving anyone?!

TIM
I don’t care.

NIKOLA
You can’t even save him!

TIM
But I can hurt you.

NIKOLA
It will not end like this.

TIM
[dryly] You sound stressed. You know I hear the great Grimaldi’s in town. You should go see it, cheer yourself up.

NIKOLA
That’s. Not. Funny.

TIM
I know.

[DETONATOR CLICKS, EXPLOSION GOES OFF BEFORE ABRUPTLY CUTTING]
[CLICK]
ELIAS
Statement of Elias Bouchard, regarding the dreams of Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, currently unresponsive. Details pulled directly from subject.

Statement begins.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
The Archivist does not know where he is, and in many ways that is correct, for to say that he was anywhere would be an error. He has no conception of his body, lying on that gray hospital bed, perplexing the doctors. Heart unbeating, lungs unmoving, but mind and nerves alive and firing wildly: everything but brain-dead.

But he is where he exists so often when his eyes are closed. He wanders the dreams he was given. A cold and well-cleaned room, sterile metal tables that overflow with a gentle trickle of blood.

[HUMMING/VIBRATIONS BEGIN IN BACKGROUND]
The hearts that beat upon them spasm and spurt without any sort of rhythm, and were they to stand still for but a moment, it might become clear just how wrong they are in their construction.

There are no strange figures standing over those tables – no mockeries of earnest learning. But in the center stands a weeping, bearded man in a lab coat. In his thin, vinyl-gloved hands, he holds an apple, that he dearly wishes otherwise.

The doctor cannot bring himself to look at the tables, so instead, looks to the Archivist, whose eye watches him, and cannot close. He tries to scream, to curse at the Archivist, pleading to him for peace, for rest. The Archivist watches as the blood creeps along the tiled floor and pools at the doctor’s feet.

Desperate, he tries to throw the apple at his observer, but it is too late. The doctor has forgotten how the elbows work, and wrenches it to the side with a sickening crack. He tries again to scream, but he hasn’t got the throat right, and the wheezing, half-choked gurgle that escapes would stir pity in the Archivist, if he had not heard it so many times before.

The Archivist waits, expecting to awaken, but there is nowhere for him to awaken to. No avenue of escape from these dreams.

He turns to see the familiar screen, the familiar woman beneath it. She looks up at him with an expression of recognition and weary dread. She types and types and types, her fingers a blur, flying across the keyboard, and yet never fast enough to outrun the relentless words that flow like dark water across the screen that stretches off into the sky.

It hurts. She is shaking her head, defiant in her well-worn terror, and tries with every corner of her will to force back the rolling tide of words. It hurts. Her fingers are still, her hands raised to her mind, trying to think, trying to comprehend. It hurts.

She turns to stare at the Archivist. There is hatred in her eyes, and blame: an aching certainty that she is here because of him. He has brought her here.

He watches as she slowly brings the keyboard up to her lips, fighting against it every moment. She bites down, shards of plastic cutting her fingers as the words scroll unfettered across the screen for miles and miles and miles. And she is gone.

[BACKGROUND VIBRATIONS ACQUIRE A RUMBLING, INDUSTRIAL QUALITY]
The Archivist wanders. He is searching, though for what he does not know. He passes those places he can no longer watch – the silent wards of peeling skin, the empty warehouse of thick darkness and frightened children, the rusted train car that smells of eager, infectious hate.

All through it, the shadow is above him; the shape that gazes down upon him, bloodshot and unblinking.

The rain is still there, though it is empty. The long and desolate road, slick with the downpour; a police car’s lights flashing over the unmoving van. The doors are open, and the too-familiar statues stand either side of the well-worn wooden box.

He looks around, his eyes scanning this forever road and the clouds of iron gray, looking for her, but she is not there. The Archivist expects – he hopes – to find the violence in her looking back at him, hungry for pursuit and murder. But the emptiness of the place is complete – the only sounds, the gentle singing of the box, and the pounding, bitter rain.

He knows the writing on the coffin has changed, though it is still carved deep into the splintered wood:

I Am For You.

He knows it is not addressed to him, but he reaches down and pulls the chains off all the same. It opens, and he walks slowly down the steps into the earth. But even as it closes above him, the great shadow still sees him.

There is nowhere in this universe that it would not blot out the sky.

The rough-hewn tunnels go down, down beyond anything but sodden earth and despair, until the Archivist arrives at the tunnels. Here he sees the train, twisted and pressed in on all sides, nothing but shrieking metal and cracked glass. He climbs inside, and takes his seat, mouth tasting of mud and soil, his eyes moving through the dust and grit unblinking.

The passenger is there, though she is, as always, stationary. Dry dirt trickles between her teeth as she smiles mirthlessly, seeing the Archivist has returned. She is relaxed, suspended from a dozen broken handrails and shattered, jagged seats. They cut her flesh, but she does not bleed. There is no pain in her eyes. There is nothing except the certainty of her fate.

The train begins to move, the wheels screaming with the awful weight of it, every part buckling and pressing in, but the Archivist is not afraid. His only fear is that even here, at the center of the world, barreling towards a lightless, infinite tomb, still, he will be watched. Still, he will watch.

The expression on the passenger’s face does not change, even as the contorting metal crushes her skull like an egg, as she vanishes from view. He catches a glimpse of an advert above his seat: “Dig.”

There is a door in front of him. A yellow door. He knows the dream it used to lead to; he knows it well. But that’s not where it leads anymore. He does not know what is behind it anymore, and he is deathly afraid of finding out.

[HIGHER-PITCHED, TINNITIS-LIKE OSCILLATING SOUND ADDED TO BACKGROUND VIBRATIONS]
The Archivist turns away. Behind him are the ants. They move like a terrible rolling wave along the hard-packed ground, and he can see every twitching antenna, every clenching mandible. Somewhere, underneath that twitching, burrowing mass, is the exterminator. He is screaming. The Archivist knows he is screaming, can see him screaming, although the sound is lost under the noise of those hundred million ants, that crawl and scurry over everything.

For a second, a hand breaches the shifting mound, desperately stretched towards the Archivist in supplication, pleading for help. The Archivist watches, as it disappears painfully back into that sea of scrabbling life.

Then all at once, the ants are gone, fled in a moment away from the still-shuddering form of the exterminator, and a familiar terror finally pushes its way into the Archivist’s heart.

Before him rises an incinerator door, the glowing light of the flames curling around the cracks. With a wailing shriek, the door opens, and the burning silhouette that stands within is ingrained upon the Archivist’s racing mind. They smoke and sizzle, but still the worms crawl through her charred and pockmarked flesh, her now-singed red dress shifting with the movement beneath it.

[OSCILLATION GROWS LOUDER]
The exterminator looks to her, then to the Archivist, and it is not certain which he fears more.

The Archivist, for his part, is hopelessly willing the dream to stop. But as she takes one scorched step after another, it is clear that he has no power to make it.

When faced with her, he even longs for the terrible dream of the melted woman, who would see everything desolated without rhyme or reason. But she was beyond his reach the moment she knew he was there, so the Archivist can only stand and stare, as the hive goes about its infested, long-dead work.

The dark building is newer, but he knows it well; knows the two lost souls who creep through it with an alert hunger on their faces. He recognizes that look from the other hunter, whose dreams he has watched for so long. They stalk the darkness itself, and hope to catch and kill it before it can do the same to them. They see him watching, but they cannot catch his scent.

At last, he is in the moonlit graveyard – the oldest of the dreams. It is peaceful, cool and damp, as the rolling, boggy fields stretch out in all directions. He hears her calling pathetically from the bottom of the graves, but by now he knows there is nothing he can do but stare. She begs to be released, to dream of this place no more, but there is nothing he can do.

So he watches her, trying in his single-minded focus to ignore the attention of that impossible thing that covers the sky, and fixes its gaze on him with such force it would choke him – were he breathing.

Another dissection room, another figure standing in its centre – but this one is calm. She simply looks at him sadly, a pity in her face that burns him worse than any flame. More than anything, the Archivist wants to look away, to turn his eye from her gentle sadness, from the disappointment in what she sees in him.

But he cannot, so he watches her, until she simply fades away.

[GROWING METALLIC, ECHOING SOUND, FADING IN AND OUT]
And at last, the Archivist looks up. At last, he looks into the eye that sees all, and knows all, and clutches at the secret terrors of your heart. The Ceaseless Watcher of all that is, and all that was; the voracious, infinite hunger the tears at his soul, invoking him to discover, to observe, to experience all, and everything, and forever.

It stares into him, and it stares out of him, and he is falling into the devouring eternity of its pupil. He wants to cry out in horror, but he cannot.

He. Is. Whole.

And still he does not wake. Wandering his slim collection of gifted nightmares, passing the grey and lifeless remains of severed dreams he can no longer watch, he waits – but not for long – before they all begin again.

ELIAS
You’re doing well, John. I only hope you can continue your growth without my guidance.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]
[ELIAS SIGHS]
[sullenly] Come in.

[DOOR OPENS]
Hello, Inspector. Martin. I’m, uh, sorry to hear about Tim –

MARTIN
Don’t.

ELIAS
And Daisy, I suppose –

MARTIN
Don’t. You. Dare.

ELIAS
I suppose it’s some consolation Basira made it out. And John. More or less.

[MARTIN INHALES ANGRILY]
POLICE OFFICER
[cutting Martin off] Is this him?

MARTIN
– uh – yes.

POLICE OFFICER
Right. Elias Bouchard, you’re under arrest.

ELIAS
[grumpy] On what crime?

POLICE OFFICER
Take your pick. Never had a tape recording of a murder before; something of a novelty.

And that’s not the half of it – plenty of stuff in those files could easily get you a nasty end, if you weren’t careful.

ELIAS
[hmph] No Melanie?

[EXASPERATED SIGH OVER HIM IN THE BACKGROUND]
I would have thought she would have wanted to gloat.

MARTIN
No. I – I, I –

ELIAS
You didn’t tell her. [hm] Worried she might create too much of a scene? I understand. I just hope she… doesn’t hold it against you.

MARTIN
That’s – that’s not –

POLICE OFFICER
[interrupting] Don’t worry, Mr. Blackwood. We will take it from here.

ELIAS
I’m sure you will. However, before we proceed, I have a flash drive in my shirt pocket –

[MORE EXASPERATED NOISES IN BACKGROUND]
– please ensure it gets the Chief Inspector Henderson. It contains various information I think she – and the Metropolitan Police – would be keen not to have released to the public.

POLICE OFFICER
Yes, I was briefed that would probably be the case. Can’t let you go, though – not with all the evidence kindly provided by your colleagues.

ELIAS
I quite understand. I would just hate for my case to be too… truncated –

POLICE OFFICER
[interrupting] Not my place to say, Mr. Bouchard. I’m just here to get you behind bars. You and the chief can discuss the rest.

MARTIN
It’s better than you deserve.

ELIAS
Perhaps so, but I’m glad you were sensible about it. I was concerned you might have bought into Melanie’s… fixation.

POLICE OFFICER
Gave you to us all but wrapped up in a bow.

ELIAS
I must admit I’m impressed, Martin.

[FURTHER EXASPERATED BACKGROUND NOISES AS ELIAS SPEAKS]
I knew you were all planning something, of course, but I didn’t believe you specifically would have the, uh – capacity for boldness that you displayed. [hm] It took me quite by surprise.

MARTIN
You didn’t just see it in me?

ELIAS
Honestly, I didn’t look. For all my power, I will admit I am not immune to making the occasional lazy assumption. I presumed that I knew you thoroughly, but by the time you demonstrated otherwise – well. There was simply too much to keep watching over. I only have two eyes, after all.

POLICE OFFICER
Right, are you all done now?

ELIAS
I believe so. I think we should be fine – provided you make sure the data reaches the Chief Inspector.

POLICE OFFICER
I’m sure she’ll be happy to pick you out a cell personally.

ELIAS
So long as it isn’t the morgue, I’m sure I’ll be perfectly comfortable.

MARTIN
Just be, be careful with him, all right, he can see things – put thoughts and – stuff into your head –

POLICE OFFICER
Like I said: I’ve been briefed. And the situation is being monitored –

ELIAS
Quite unnecessary, I assure you.

MARTIN
Just – please be careful, he’s really dangerous.

POLICE OFFICER
By all means, Mr. Bouchard, why don’t you have a look in my head, and see exactly what will happen to you when you mess with me?

ELIAS
There will be no need for that, Inspector, [small forced laugh] I’m sure we’ll get along famously.

POLICE OFFICER
Good.

ELIAS
Best of luck, Martin. Let the others know I shall be thinking of them.

POLICE OFFICER
Come on, now.

[SOUND OF OFFICER CUFFING ELIAS]
ELIAS
[ow] Are those really necessary?

[SOUND OF ELIAS BEING APPARENTLY PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH]
ELIAS
[gag, wheeze]

POLICE OFFICER
Not really, no.

ELIAS
[strained] I see.

POLICE OFFICER
Let’s go.

ELIAS
[wheeze] Goodbye, Martin. [wheeze] Be seeing you.

[FOOTSTEPS; DOOR CLOSES.]
[MARTIN SIGHS.]
[HIGH-PITCHED, SQUEALING STATIC.]
PETER
Must be a relief.

MARTIN
– Uh –

PETER
Honestly, I thought there’d be more of a scene –

[MARTIN EXHALES LOUDLY]
– but he always surprises me.

MARTIN
[freaking out] What – what are you doing here, Mr. Lukas?!

PETER
Please – call me Peter.

MARTIN
No – no, I think I’m okay!

PETER
As you like. [patronizingly] Look, don’t let Elias get to you –

[MARTIN EXHALES LOUDLY]
– you did very well! Really! I honestly think you managed to surprise him – even if he’d sooner die than admit it.

MARTIN
I’m sorry, I’m – I’m still not sure exactly what this is.

PETER
Oh, right, of course.

[GROWING NON-LUKAS-STATIC-TYPE BACKGROUND VIBRATIONS]
Well: you’ve successfully managed to remove Elias as the head of the Magnus Institute. So…?

MARTIN
Oh – oh, god, what does that do?!

PETER
Oh! No, nonono, no – not in any metaphysical sense, no. He’s still very much the – how did he insist on phrasing it? – ah, yes, the “beating heart” of the Institute. But practically speaking, he can hardly fulfill his more mundane managerial duties from a jail cell.

MARTIN
So, he knew this was going to happen?

PETER
Not exactly? He anticipated that you would likely find some way to remove him, so he made alternative arrangements.

MARTIN
Which would be you.

PETER
Exactly!

To be honest with you, Martin, I didn’t expect to be taking over the place so soon, or in quite such a state of disarray. But I’ll do my best to keep the place afloat.

MARTIN
[sigh] …right.

PETER
Oh, what’s that look for? You won! I am sorry if it doesn’t look quite like you hoped, but – here we are!

MARTIN
I suppose so.

So what now?

PETER
Well, if you could send Melanie and Basira up to see me, I’d like to introduce myself. After that, I’ll put through a couple of weeks of paid leave for you all – I think giving everyone some space to try and deal with the loss of Tim and Daisy might do everyone some good.

[MARTIN SIGHS]
Oh, and if you want to talk to a counselor, the Institute will of course cover any cost.

MARTIN
Uh – thanks?

PETER
Don’t mention it. I know how it can be with a new boss. I’d like to help you ease into it.

MARTIN
Is, is that –

…can I… go?

PETER
Of course!

Oh, and Elias said you’d probably be keeping a close eye on the Archivist’s condition, so I’d be keen to hear any developments.

MARTIN
…

…suuuuuure.

PETER
Marvellous. And don’t look so down! I know, change can be scary, but eventually it happens just the same.

I think we’re going to great things, Martin.

Great. Things.
