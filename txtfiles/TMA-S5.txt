[INT. THE MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, 2015]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Clothes rustle.]
MARTIN
Careful!

TIM
Sh-hh!

[A door opens.]
TIM, SASHA, MARTIN
SURPRISE!

[Someone blows a party horn.]
ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Jesus!

TIM
Happy birthday, boss.

SASHA
Happy – Oh, (laughing, a bit) are you okay?

ARCHIVIST
No, I! – Christ, one second.

MARTIN
Sorry, sorry; Tim wanted to surprise you, and –

TIM
Snitch.

[Some papers have been rustling in the background over this.]
ARCHIVIST
No, no, it’s fine, thank you. Just a – shock.

TIM
(duh) Well, that’s the idea.

[Someone flips a page. Probably the Archivist.]
ARCHIVIST
Indeed. Though, uh, honestly, the bottle of wine was just fine.

[He pulls out a chair as he talks.]
TIM
Pfft, yeah, as a decoy.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, well, thank you. This is very – (rapid page flipping) elaborate of you.

SASHA
Plus, it was kind of fun, giving you a heart attack.

ARCHIVIST
Mm, I’m sure. I notice you didn’t jump out at Martin when he had a birthday.

TIM
(can hear his smile) No, he’s way too jumpy as it is.

[Martin lets out a sound of singular offense.]
TIM
We were worried he might damage himself!

MARTIN
(higher) Hey!

[Clothing sounds, as if he’s folding his arms.]
MARTIN
(hmph) Well – I preferred going out for ice cream anyway.

ARCHIVIST
You went for ice cream?

SASHA
Yes, you were there!

MARTIN
You had – rum and raisin, and taught us all about emulsifiers.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Right, yes, (unconvincing) I – I remember.

TIM
(smiling) Liar.

ARCHIVIST
Well, thank you anyway. This is all – very touching.

TIM
We just wanted to do something to lighten the mood, you know?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, I’m – (inhale) aware it’s been a – rough start.

[He exhales.]
SASHA
(*really?*) That’s not what this was about; we just thought you could use a chance to unwind.

ARCHIVIST
(exhale) I.. suppose it couldn’t hurt.

[A soft knock on the door.]
JONAH MAGNUS (AS ELIAS)
Knock knock.

TIM
Double boss!

SASHA
Elias?

MAGNUS
I’m not too late for cake, am I?

ARCHIVIST
There’s a cake?

TIM
How did y– Martin! That was a secret!

MARTIN
(high) I didn’t say anything!

MAGNUS
He didn’t have to. Nothing escapes my notice, and I like to keep an eye out for this sort of thing.

TIM
Well – it’s – good to see you.

ARCHIVIST
Yes – Y,yes! Come in?

MAGNUS
So, how old is the birthday boy?

ARCHIVIST
Uh – thirty-eight.

[There’s a sound that can be interpreted as Sasha either tch-ing or flicking him.]
SASHA
Liar.

[Everyone laughs.]
ARCHIVIST
(petulant) How would you know.

TIM
What, does someone need to change their password again?

ARCHIVIST
I – what?

[Tim laughs.]
ARCHIVIST
Sasha, have you been going through my computer –

SASHA
(overlapping, definitely yes) Definitely not; No idea what he’s talking about.

TIM
‘Course not!

[They both keep laughing in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
(mostly under his breath) That’s really not appropriate.

[He sighs, unheard.]
MARTIN
Oh, come on, guys!

MAGNUS
Anyways. Somebody mentioned cake.

TIM
Uh, yeah. You did.

MAGNUS
(inhale of mock surprise) Yes, I did, didn’t I.

[Tim sighs.]
TIM
Alright, alright. Well, I guess the cat’s out of the bag now, anyway, look – just give me a second.

[Someone sighs. Again, probably the Archivist.]
[We hear some ceramic-type sounds as Tim gets out the cake.]
TIM
(singing) Happy birthday –

[Everyone else joins in.]
EVERYONE
– to you.

ARCHIVIST
(dear god this is happening) Oh, okay.

MARTIN
Mhm!

EVERYONE
Happy birthday to you.

ARCHIVIST
Right!

EVERYONE
Happy birth–

ARCHIVIST
(please cease) Yes!

[He sighs. No one listens.]
EVERYONE
day, dear –

TIM, SASHA, MARTIN
– Jo-on.

MAGNUS
(simultaneous) – Archivist.

EVERYONE
Happy birthday to you.

ARCHIVIST
I –

TIM
(overlapping, laughing) Yay!

ARCHIVIST
Alright, yes – thank you. I do hope you’re not planning to light those candles.

TIM
(who, me?) Oh, goodness.

[He shakes a box of matches.]
TIM
A source of ignition? In the Archives?

[Sasha laughs.]
TIM
Uh-oh.

ARCHIVIST
Tim.

TIM
(overlapping) Mmm.

Oh. Whoops! (strikes a match) Sorry. My hand slipped.

[The flame crackles and burns into being.]
TIM
And again –

[A slight crackle as he lights a candle.]
TIM
And again –

[The same crackle.]
TIM
And a couple more times – here, I’m so clumsy today; that is a lot of fire.

[The candles continue to crackle in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m really not comfortable –

SASHA
So blow them out, then.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. (slight pause) Right, yeah –

MAGNUS
And make a wish.

ARCHIVIST
If I wish for you all to go away, do you think it’ll work?

TIM
He’s so grumpy today, isn’t he Martin?

MARTIN
Uh – oh! Well, um –

TIM
(cutting him off) Do you think it’s his looming sense of mortality?

[Martin splutters.]
MARTIN
Uh – I, I don’t think –

ARCHIVIST
Fine.

[He blows out the candles. Everyone cheers, someone claps.]
TIM
So, what did you wish for?

ARCHIVIST
I can’t tell you.

MAGNUS
He wished for a little bit of peace and quiet.

ARCHIVIST
(small inhale) Was it that obvious?

[Small exhale.]
MAGNUS
Oh, I wouldn’t worry, John. It’s an Archive. Quiet is very much the course du jour.

TIM
Well, after the party, at least. Wine, anyone?

ARCHIVIST
Tim, it’s eleven in the morning.

[The cork pops.]
TIM
Pfft, yeah, at your birthday party.

[He begins pouring.]
ARCHIVIST
I really don’t think it’s appropriate –

MAGNUS
(overlapping) I’ll allow it. In fact! I’ll join you.

ARCHIVIST
(surprise) Oh! O-kay, um, a-al, alright then?

[Sounds of continued pouring behind all this.]
SASHA
Martin?

MARTIN
Oh! Uh, (slight strained laugh) I mean – I don’t – normally – drink wine, you know – t-tannins are a proven headache trigger, and so –

SASHA
Martin.

[More pouring sounds.]
MARTIN
W-, uh – (more stuttering) – yeah, sure, maybe, just uh, a drop. Heh.

ARCHIVIST
(more statement than question) You know that there’s a lot of tannin in tea as well?

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
Hang on, have you been recording this?

[Clothing rustling.]
TIM
Oh! Yeah! I – just thought it might be nice, you know, something to look back on when we’re all old and sick of each other.

SASHA
You probably should have told us, Tim.

TIM
(laughing) What, are you afraid we’re going to get sued over the Happy Birthday song?

MARTIN
(slightly higher) Oh, oh, well I am now!

[Tim sighs.]
SASHA
It’s just a bit of a privacy thing.

[ARCHIVIST]
(under his breath, hmph) Oh, hypocrite.

TIM
(overlapping) Alright, alright, fine, look. I’m turning it off. Any last words for your future selves?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. (to the tape) Fire Tim.

[Tim laughs.]
[INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE, PRESENT DAY]
[We hear the strange howling background designating our fearful new world.]
[The Archivist exhales, somewhat shakily.]
[Something creaks.]
[He breathes again.]
[More creaking.]
[There’s a soft knock-knock-knock at the door.]
[Footsteps.]
MARTIN
(gentle) Hey.

ARCHIVIST
Hi.

[His voice is rough, weary – a stark contrast to the younger version of himself we just heard on the tape.]
[More footsteps as Martin gets closer.]
MARTIN
You, uh, listening to the tapes again?

[Some rustling sounds as he situates himself.]
MARTIN
How many times is that, now?

ARCHIVIST
They were sent to me, Martin. (inhale) There’s got to be some reason –

MARTIN
(sigh) Gloating, John. Elias won, and there were some tapes he’d kept for himself, and he wanted to gloat. So he sent them. I, I don’t see-

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) He’s not. Elias.

MARTIN
Jonah, then. I don’t know; I find it hard to think of him as – (pause, inhale) I don’t really like to think of him.

[Silence.]
[Martin sighs.]
MARTIN
You should get some sleep.

ARCHIVIST
(exhale) I – (sigh) Can’t. I, I can’t. I, I don’t think I do anymore. Sleep. (shaky sort of laugh) How long’s it been, now?

MARTIN
I don’t know. It’s not like there are days to count, anymore, (sigh) all the clocks are stopped, and…

[He trails off, somewhat shakily.]
ARCHIVIST
Well, I haven’t yet. I get – tired, but it doesn’t feel the same.

[The safehouse creaks.]
ARCHIVIST
Probably for the best. Sleep doesn’t look… pleasant.

MARTIN
…No, it’s. (unsteady inhale) It’s. Not.

ARCHIVIST
I couldn’t wake you.

MARTIN
I’m sorry.

ARCHIVIST
It’s not –

[He sniffs, and then lets out a sound that’s somewhat wheezy, almost strangled. It’s unclear if it’s a humorless laugh, or him near tears. Possibly both.]
ARCHIVIST
You’re not the one who ended the world.

[The background howls. The safehouse creaks. Martin holds back a sigh.]
MARTIN
(somewhat forced brightness) Well, just as well I don’t remember my dream.

ARCHIVIST
I do.

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
(inhale) I see most of the suffering around here. When it’s quiet, it just – It’s like.. I can.. see it, like I’m watching all of it.

MARTIN
You haven’t been opening the curtains.

ARCHIVIST
No, I don’t need to.

It can see us here, and.. and I can see out as well.

MARTIN
O-kay, we’ll just file that under – ominous for now.

[A sigh.]
[More creaking.]
MARTIN
We seem safe enough in here, at least.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose so.

MARTIN
(trying) Bit of a hideaway?

ARCHIVIST
Or a prison.

MARTIN
..Yes. Still, better than outside.

[More creaking. There’s now a musical component of the outside. It sounds… full of iron. It sounds like a certain portion of The Magnus Archives’ theme, though it’s not entirely recognizable as such.]
MARTIN
It sounds bad.

[The Archivist laughs that strange, humorless laugh.]
ARCHIVIST
It is.

[Brief silence.]
MARTIN
Are we still safe?

ARCHIVIST
Y-Yes. It – It doesn’t want to harm me.

MARTIN
And me?

ARCHIVIST
I won’t let it.

[More creaking.]
MARTIN
Um. (uh) Thanks.

[More silence. More creaking.]
[A breath.]
[Clothes rustling.]
MARTIN
John, it’s not your fault.

ARCHIVIST
(sharp) Martin, can we not do this again?

MARTIN
Sorry.

ARCHIVIST
I’m just – I’m mourning a world I killed –

MARTIN
(overlapping, placating) I know –

ARCHIVIST
(increasingly fervent) and we’re all trapped in its rotting corpse!–

MARTIN
Enough, John.

[The Archivist starts taking out a tape.]
ARCHIVIST
Have you heard the Gertrude one?

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
The Gertrude one; there are a few of them, but this is my favorite.

[Over their conversation, he gets the tape ready.]
MARTIN
(sigh) I don’t –

ARCHIVIST
Just. Listen.

[He puts the tape in.]
[INT. THE MAGNUS INSTITUTE, ARCHIVES, GERTRUDE’S OFFICE, MARCH 20TH, 2015]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
GERTRUDE
Right. If you’re listening to this, then it is likely that – (she breaks off, sighs) No. Let’s not beat around the bush. If you’re listening to this, it means I’m dead. And you have been chosen to be my replacement as Head Archivist.

Hopefully, this means you, Sasha, but if someone else is hearing this, and Elias has made a different choice for some reason, then these words are still very much intended for you.

Before I continue: It is very important to be absolutely clear this is not a joke. Nor is it any sort of prank, or game. Your colleagues have not convinced me to record this as an attempt to… haze you. This is completely serious. And very, very important for you to know.

If it is you I’m talking to, Sasha, hopefully your background in Artefact Storage will lend a certain degree of.. credence to my words. But others may have to take it on trust.

All I can do is assure you I am deadly serious. (sigh) So. The first thing you have to do is accept that you are in great danger, and will be for the rest of your life. There are now things that will actively be trying to kill you, due to your new role as Archivist, and Elias has plans for you that are little better.

You will also be unable to relinquish the position or quit the Institute, finding you are supernaturally compelled to remain.

In fact, it occurs to me that attempting to do so is probably the quickest and easiest way to establish the truth of what I am telling you, so I suggest you do so at the earliest possible opportunity.

Things you need to be aware of:

There exists in our world supernatural entities of incredible power that reflect and feed on the fears of all living creatures, but most commonly humans. Many consider them gods, and while I believe that is far too simplistic a comparison, for our purposes here it is perhaps the most useful shorthand.

They do not rule our world, but they do exercise considerable power, which they generally manifest in the form of monstrous beings that spread further fear – or, incarnations, those humans who have willingly, though not always knowingly, chosen to take on the power of these entities.

You, unfortunately, have unwittingly made the decision to become one of those incarnations. For the Institute serves a being variously known as: The Eye, It Knows You, The Beholding, The Ceaseless Watcher. It is the fear of being watched, and judged, and having all your secrets known. The Institute serves as a way for it to harvest the fears of the other entities, dragging out the suffering of those who come to give statements and – claiming their terror.

But, there is another part of being the Archivist. These.. beings, these.. gods of fear – their followers believe that they have… rituals. Grand projects which, if successful, would allow them to enter our world, reshaping it in – unthinkable ways. Molding it into a dimension where terror is as natural as gravity.

You are now one such ritual.

I do not know the exact details of it, but be wary of whatever Elias asks you to do.

Oh, yes. On the subject of Elias: Trust nothing he says. He was originally known as Jonah Magnus, the founder of this Institute, and I have known him also as James Wright, the previous head of this Institute.

He has certain… abilities of clairvoyance, which allow him to perceive out of any eye, real or symbolic, so be wary. Play ignorant as long as you can while you expand your own research.

I’ve managed to keep the Archives in a state of chaos for decades, as I believe his plan would benefit from their organization. But I leave that to your judgement. Certainly, the longer he is ignorant of how much you know, the better.

Above all else: be ready. There are many things out there loyal to other powers which know your importance to the Eye, and will want. You. Dead.

You are entering a new world, a place I’ve lived for most of my life. A place… (she sighs) A place that will often demand a high price from you. Pay it without hesitation, because one way or another, the world is now on your shoulders. (sigh)

I wish I had more time to explain it to you. But time is short, and hopefully my actions tonight will ensure that this tape never needs to see the light of day.

But if you are hearing it, then – good luck. Do what you have to do.

[She sighs, heavily.]
[The door opens.]
JURGEN LEITNER
Are you finished?

GERTRUDE
Jurgen! I told you to stay in the tunnels.

[Leitner walks in and pulls himself out a chair.]
LEITNER
Your message also told me it was urgent.

GERTRUDE
(sharper) If Elias is watching right now –

LEITNER
Then your recording all that was meaningless anyway. Besides, I’m not afraid of him.

GERTRUDE
Bravado. (heh/hm) Really?

LEITNER
Mmmmm – it’s not bravado –

GERTRUDE
We’re wasting time. Do you still have the Ruskin book?

LEITNER
I do, though I don’t relish the thought of using it. Makes it rather hard to breathe, like your chest is being –

GERTRUDE
(overlapping) Do you know the gas main, a little way out in the tunnel?

LEITNER
I do.

GERTRUDE
I need you to move it.

LEITNER
(hem-and-haw) Iiiii, ummmm. That’s. I mean it’s not just earth; there’s pipework, and all sorts of –

GERTRUDE
Find a way. I need it to be directly under the Institute, or at least closer.

LEITNER
I’m more likely to rupture it, and fill the place with gas.

GERTRUDE
(heh) Hm, that would also be acceptable.

LEITNER
Mmm. I’ll do what I can. (sigh) When do you need it?

GERTRUDE
If my guess is right, the Church’s ritual should be collapsing any time now, so – immediately.

LEITNER
And if you’re wrong?

GERTRUDE
Then a bit of gas will be the least of our worries.

LEITNER
…Right. What are you going to do?

GERTRUDE
Paper burns well.

[She holds up a container of liquid – it sloshes.]
GERTRUDE
Petrol burns better.

[It sloshes again. Leitner laughs.]
[The container sloshes again as Gertrude sets it down.]
LEITNER
I always forget your pyromaniac streak.

GERTRUDE
Mm. Remind me to tell you about Agnes sometime.

LEITNER
Right. (brief pause) Did you mean to leave the tape running?

GERTRUDE
Oh, good grief. Forty years I’ve been using them, and I swear, I’ll nev–

[Back to the howling world.]
ARCHIVIST
Can you imagine? If we’d had this?

MARTIN
But we didn’t, did we.

ARCHIVIST
No –

MARTIN
So there’s no point in dwelling. (heavy breath) John, I – This isn’t healthy.

ARCHIVIST
Healthy? I am an Avatar of voyeuristic terror, who unquestioned craving for knowledge has condemned the entire world to an eternity of torment; healthy i-isn’t – i,it’s not –

MARTIN
Fine, fine. I get it.

ARCHIVIST
Besides. G- (shaky) Grief… is healthy. I,If nothing else, it pushes away the other feelings that that – thing wants me to experience.

MARTIN
It just – It hurts me to see you wallowing like this.

ARCHIVIST
(snapping) Well, some of us weren’t able to cut ourselves off from the world before it ended.

[The safehouse creaks.]
MARTIN
That’s not fair.

ARCHIVIST
No, it’s not; I’m – I’m sorry, I just – (large shaky breath) It hurts.

MARTIN
I know.

ARCHIVIST
I need time.

MARTIN
I know. But we can’t stay in this cabin forever.

ARCHIVIST
Why not? It – It’s quiet, here, and I have you.

[It’s Martin’s turn for a humorless sound- half laugh, half exasperated sigh.]
MARTIN
What about food?

ARCHIVIST
What about it? When’s the last time you thought to eat, or even felt hungry?

MARTIN
(quietly) What? (louder, a revelation) Uh – I don’t know.

ARCHIVIST
No. Whatever is sustaining us now doesn’t need us to eat.

MARTIN
That – That can’t be possible.

ARCHIVIST
It’s a new world, Martin; the natural laws are whatever they want them to be. And I suspect they don’t much care to keep humanity fed and watered.

MARTIN
(inhale) Well, that as may be, we can’t just stay here forever.

ARCHIVIST
What could possibly be out there that you want to see?

MARTIN
A way to stop this, a way to turn the world back!

ARCHIVIST
(softer) Do you really think there is one?

MARTIN
Well, if there is, it’s not in here, is it?

ARCHIVIST
It’s so – (shaky breath) It’s so… loud, out there? The agony, the, the terror, I can see it all so much more clearly.

MARTIN
I’m sorry.

ARCHIVIST
No, it’s – (sigh) I love you, I just – (inhale) I need more time.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
It’s alright.

[Movement. Creaking. An exhale.]
MARTIN
It’s alright; I’m good at waiting.

ARCHIVIST
(near whisper) Thank you. (more normal) I just wish it didn’t feel like whatever’s out there was waiting, too.

MARTIN
…Yeah.

[Brief silence, then-]
[Clothes rustling.]
MARTIN
Hey – Hey, when did you start recording?

[The safehouse creaks.]
ARCHIVIST
(confusion) I – didn’t. I only brought one, and I’ve been using it to play the tapes.

MARTIN
Oh. (sigh) That’s not a great sign.

ARCHIVIST
No. No, it’s not.

[We hear clinking, as if from some bottles. Someone turns some pages, then zips something.]
GERRY KEAY
Hmm.

GERTRUDE
Find anything interesting back there?

[As she speaks, Gerry startles and knocks down whatever it was that had been clinking. It hits the floor with a clatter.]
GERRY
Yeah, sorry, I was just, um – yeah.

GERTRUDE
Curiosity is a very dangerous trait in our line of work, Gerard.

GERRY
So is ignorance.

[Gertrude laughs: Fair enough.]
GERTRUDE
Well, you’re not going to find many dark secrets in the stationery cupboard.

[One of them closes the cupboard.]
GERRY
(amused) Just the recorded confession of your evil plans, then.

[Something creaks.]
GERTRUDE
Oh, I’d be something of a fool to leave that one in the recorder.

GERRY
I’ve never really seen you use it.

GERTRUDE
Mm. It’s generally only for those statements I think might be useful to my successor. Or, the occasional interview.

GERRY
So, do I get to hear them?

GERTRUDE
Perhaps. If you live long enough. But somehow I doubt Elias would look favorably on your application.

And if I’m being quite honest –

GERRY
(overlapping) Yeah, I know, I know. And I don’t want your job.

GERTRUDE
Believe me, the perks aren’t worth the shackles.

GERRY
(heard this all before) Yeah, yeah.

[Someone turns another page.]
GERRY
So, what’s the verdict?

GERTRUDE
Hm?

GERRY
(duh) On The Travels.1

GERTRUDE
Oh – Burn it, I think. You said Mr. Hampton was dead?

[Page flip.]
GERRY
Yep – and not peacefully.

GERTRUDE
(overlapping) But you hadn’t seen its powers…?

GERRY
Not directly.

GERTRUDE
Well, given the themes of the original, I doubt it has anything that would be worth the danger.

GERRY
And when in doubt…

GERTRUDE
Well, quite.

GERRY
Can I use your wastepaper bin?

GERTRUDE
Yes, it’s just –

[She cuts off – just as there’s a creak from a desk or chair, likely Gerry beginning to get up.]
GERTRUDE
Wait. Surely you didn’t bring it here!

GERRY
Well, yeah, I, uh –

GERTRUDE
Gerard, we’ve talked about this. Bringing unvetted artefacts or books into the Archive is incredibly dangerous.

GERRY
It’s locked away!

GERTRUDE
And I’m sure the lock is very sturdy, but that doesn’t stop it being an unnecessary risk.

GERRY
(softer) Yeah. I’m sorry.

GERTRUDE
This is exactly the sort of thing that will get you killed!

GERRY
I said I was sorry!

[Briefest of pauses.]
GERTRUDE
Then we’ll say no more about it.

[She goes back to flipping through pages.]
GERTRUDE
I don’t enjoy being hard on you, but I really would rather you stayed broadly intact.

GERRY
I’m touched. You’re going soft in your old age.

GERTRUDE
(heh) Well, you are occasionally useful. Despite your foolishness.

GERRY
Flatterer.

GERTRUDE
Heh. You can probably burn it in the back courtyard, if you’re careful.

GERRY
(okay, okay) Yeah, will do.

GERTRUDE
And for goodness’ sake, make sure no one sees you. The last thing we need is a letter to Elias about book burnings.

GERRY
Look, if you have somewhere better to burn these books, then –

GERTRUDE
(overlapping, jokingly over-the-top) Of course, Gerard! I just happened not to mention the network of sinister tunnels that snake beneath the Archive where I keep all my darkest secrets.

GERRY
I mean, you joke, but there could be! It’s that kinda place.

GERTRUDE
I rather hope I would have found them by now. I like to think I’m not a complete incompetent.

GERRY
Until dementia hits.

GERTRUDE
Given my choice to confide in you, I rather suspect it already has.

[She flips more pages.]
GERTRUDE
Go burn your book!

[More flipping.]
GERRY
Gertrude.

GERTRUDE
(continuing her work) Mm?

GERRY
What happens if we fail?

[She stops.]
GERTRUDE
In… what sense?

GERRY
If we miss a ritual; you know – if one of them works.

GERTRUDE
Been losing sleep, have you?

GERRY
Yeah – something like that.

GERTRUDE
(measured) If we are lucky, then that failure will also mean our deaths.

[She exhales.]
GERRY
You don’t think they can reach us after death?

GERTRUDE
I suppose that depends on your religious beliefs.

[Her chair creaks.]
GERTRUDE
Personally, I suspect death puts us beyond their power, either we find ourselves in some… afterlife, or because we simply – cease to be.

GERRY
Yeah, I guess.

GERTRUDE
And I am certain that either scenario is preferable to lingering in a world they control.

They’re – (sigh) – already able to circumvent physics, and suspend natural laws. If one were to genuinely press through, I suspect they would rewrite them wholesale, most likely making them… utterly incomprehensible to any survivors.

They – They might still need us human enough to be afraid, but beyond that…

Let’s just surmise that (sigh) petty rules like space or time would be unlikely to factor into the proceedings. They might even stop death entirely, deny us the one last escape, keeping us alive and afraid – forever.

[Pause. Gerry exhales. Then:]
GERRY
And taxes?

GERTRUDE
(heh) Taxes, I imagine, will continue.

Beyond that, I honestly don’t know. I suppose it depends on which one comes through. The world of the Stranger would be – very different to that of the Corruption.

GERRY
Eugh. (pause) And if it does happen –

GERTRUDE
It’s my fondest ambition to make sure it does not.

GERRY
Yeah, sure, but – suppose it does.

GERTRUDE
(sigh) Very well.

GERRY
Could it be undone?

[Silence.]
[Gertrude takes a breath. Her chair creaks.]
GERTRUDE
(decision made) No. I don’t think so. Once an Entity fully manifested, I doubt it would be keen to fully relinquish its grip on realit–

GERTRUDE
Once an Entity fully manifested, I doubt it would be keen to relinquish its grip on reality. And as for those unlucky enough to survive its rule… I don’t think they’d be in a state to do anything about it.

[Gerry exhales, a big heavy pfft of a thing. We hear some clothing sounds.]
GERRY
Well. Then I guess we’d better not let it happen.

GERTRUDE.
Well. Quite.

Now. I believe you have an evil book to burn?

GERRY
Yeah. Of course.

[His clothing rustles as he makes to get up.]
GERRY
You, uh – need anything else burning?

GERTRUDE
(a bit of a laugh to it) No, no. Not right now. I think I’m alright, thank you for the offer.

GERRY
Right.

GERTRUDE
Oh, and, Gerard –

GERRY
Hm?

[Chair creak.]
GERTRUDE
Don’t go rifling through my things in future. It could end… badly for you.

[Some rummaging noises.]
SASHA
This it?

TIM
Oh, thank god. I thought I was seeing things.

SASHA
Glad I could help.

TIM
I didn’t know he was actually gonna ask me to get it for him; I just mentioned it ‘cause he was talking about recording.

SASHA
Well, I’m sure he’s waiting!

TIM
(grumble) Mm, he can wait a bit longer.

[There’s a knock-knock-knock type sound.]
SASHA
Fantastic! Good of you to volunteer to help me.

TIM
Uh – I, I didn’t actually –

SASHA
Grab a stapler.

[Tim sighs in defeat.]
TIM
Fine. (another knock) What are we doing?

[We hear some more pages rustling.]
SASHA
John’s been getting frustrated with all the loose statement sheets around. (stapler) I’m going box by box, collating and stapling them. And now, so are you.

TIM
(exaggerated sigh) If you say so.

SASHA
(mock sympathy) I do.

[You can hear the smile in her voice as she speaks.]
[A few moments pass in silence with them flipping through statements and stapling. Then there’s a sigh from Tim, and:]
TIM
So. How are you finding our new leader?

[Stapler.]
SASHA
Mm, alright, I suppose. Early days yet.

[More page flipping.]
TIM
Sure, sure.

[Stapler. Pages.]
TIM
Do you think he knows what he’s doing?

SASHA
Mm, he’ll get there. (stapler) I just wish he wouldn’t take it out on Martin in the meantime.

[As their conversation continues, so do the stapling and page sounds.]
TIM
(heh) If only there had been someone more qualified!

SASHA
Tim.

TIM
Sasha.

SASHA
(same tone) It’s Elias’s decision.

TIM
It’s some sexist bullshit, is what it is.

SASHA
I mean. Probably.

TIM
Look, it should have been you, and you just know if you had called him out, the little weasel would start talking about traditions, and – (bad Elias impersonation) – the values of our esteemed founder, Jimmy Magma.

[Sasha starts laughing.]
TIM
Jonie… Magnum?

SASHA
Closer.

TIM
Jack Magnet?

SASHA
(laughing) That’s the one.

TIM
Ah, I’m serious, though. You should say something.

SASHA
Mm, Tim – I’ve been in academia for what, ten years now?

TIM
Mm.

SASHA
I know how this goes! I didn’t get the job. If I kick up a stink, I’ll just get blackballed.

TIM
(resigned) Ah, yeah. (brief pause, mischievous) What if we kill him?

SASHA
(ha) What, Elias?

TIM
No. Big Boss Sims. Cut the brakes on his office chair; no one would ever know.

[Sasha starts laughing again.]
TIM
Swap in a poisoned tea bag, pin it on Martin – the perfect crime.

SASHA
(still laughing) And how do you know that you won’t be the one that gets it? That boy makes a lot of tea.

TIM
No, it’s okay; I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocaine powder.

[Sasha lets out an exaggerated groan at the reference. Tim hehs.]
[A brief moment of silence, then:]
TIM
So, what are you gonna do?

SASHA
I don’t know, really. Might just get another job.

TIM
What, seriously, just jump ship?

SASHA
(eh) Yeah, I guess so. I mean, there’s not much out there at the moment, but I’ve got a few alerts set up.

TIM
(rueful) I can’t believe you’d just abandon our intense will-they, won’t-they storyline like that.

SASHA
Eeerm, I’m pretty sure we established it’s very much won’t they.

TIM
No, no, no, no, see – we had the ill-advised hookup, the awkward aftermath, and the gradually rebuilt friendship, but – that’s all season two stuff. We’ve got like five more seasons before we get the heartwarming epilogue that makes it canon.

SASHA
I know it’s hard to hear, mate, but you’re not the love interest. (beat) I think you might be the character they drop after the pilot!

TIM
(you wound me) Uh, wow. You are vicious today.

SASHA
Sorry, Tim! I can’t hear you over all this stapling.

[They staple in silence for a bit. Sasha sighs.]
SASHA
I guess it’s just – I don’t have anything keeping me here. You’ve got your brother –

TIM
(quieter) Yeah.

SASHA
Sorry. And Martin can’t go anywhere that’ll look too hard at his CV.

TIM
Wait. How do you know about that?

SASHA
It’s all on the system. Our digital security is shocking, by the way. Besides, it’s not even a good lie.

TIM
Okay, but seriously, you cannot let Martin know. He’ll think I told you, and I swore to keep schtum.

SASHA
Hey, don’t worry. I mean – I kinda just ended up here. And I like it – l,liked it. But if I’m bashing my head against the glass ceiling, it’s time to go.

TIM
Well. I’ll miss you.

SASHA
(fond) Yeah. You will.

TIM
Oh, for god’s sake. (bad impression of presumably everyone else at the Institute) Oh, Tim’s so hard to talk to, seriously, he won’t stop making jokes and references, not like Sasha. (normal) They’ve got no idea.

SASHA
(ha!) And they never will.

TIM
Seriously, though. Everyone thinks you’re just this reliable, down-to-earth nerd –

SASHA
And what makes you think they’re wrong?

TIM
So what, actually I’m the one who doesn’t get to see the real you?

SASHA
No such thing.

TIM
As what?

SASHA
A – A real you. I don’t think so, at least. It’s all just masks.

TIM
(amused) Alright, Stanislavski.

SASHA
You know what I mean.

TIM
You really believe that?

SASHA
Kind of! I mean, who knows why we do what we do?

TIM
I do.

SASHA
No. All you know is what your brain does to justify what you do. It’s no more reason than the face you put on for John. The only real you is the actions you take.

TIM
Hey, I’ll have you know I have a rich inner life.

SASHA
How nice for you. But hurry up with your outer one; you’re falling behind, and I’m not saving you any staples.

TIM
(laughing) Yeah, yeah. I still can’t believe Gertrude was allowed to let this place get into such a state!

SASHA
Mm. I just wanna know why.

TIM
What d’you mean why? You saw her, she’s like a hundred years old and more cardigan than woman. She just started to lose it. Sad, but it happens.

SASHA
You never talked to her, did you?

TIM
Well, I mean, I must have at some point.

SASHA
(heh) You’d remember.

TIM
Why? What was she like?

SASHA
Stone. Cold. Bitch.

TIM
Sasha!

SASHA
And sharper than you! No way this is accidental.

TIM
(pfft) Oh, yeah, this is all a big geriatric conspiracy.

[Silence.]
TIM
Wait, seriously?

SASHA
Mhm.

TIM
What possible reason could she have for being criminally incompetent in a manky old archive?

SASHA
No idea. And honestly, it kind of worries me.

TIM
Well, tell you what. If you get eaten alive by improperly filed statements, me and Martin will avenge you.

SASHA
(tch) Well, aren’t you sweet.

TIM
I mean it! We’ll burn this place to the ground, it’ll be all like (mock yelling) SASHA! SAASHAAAAA!

SASHA
And what about John?

TIM
(John impression) Well, given the incoherence of this statement, I find it hard to believe it ever occurred.

[Sasha laughs.]
TIM
In fact, based on the evidence, I find it highly unlikely that Sasha ever even existed at all.

SASHA
No. You took it too far! I’m unforgettable!

[Tim laughs.]
TIM
Alright. He fires you because of all the drugs and the wild orgies on Archive property.

SASHA
(still laughing) Yeah, that’s fair. Now, get back to work.

TIM
Yes, ma’am! See? Told you you’d make a good boss.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. SCOTLAND, A DAISY TONNER SAFEHOUSE, PRESENT DAY]
[The background roars.]
[The Archivist’s breaths come shaky.]
[The safehouse creaks.]
[The Archivist exhales; the safehouse creaks again; a brown static begins to rise from the background.]
ARCHIVIST
(quiet) Wha–

[The static continues to rise in volume.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT?)
There is a place, deep in the heart of fear, where you trap yourself and claim that it is safety.

[The static dies slightly to a comfortable level.]
It was once a cabin and professes still to be such, but as with all in this new world that promises respite, it is a trap.

[The safe house creaks.]
The land outside is warped and twisted by the touch of those things that feed on your suffering, and behind those rough, wooden planks it seems they cannot reach you.

The screams may linger on the distant breeze, and your Eye may wander beyond the curtains from time to time, but you and the one you love are, it seems, safe.

If you had need to eat, no doubt there would be food; if you had need to sleep, no doubt the beds would be welcoming.

But you have need of neither, and so you sit in your meager comfort and belief of security with nothing to do, nothing to distract your mind from the agonies that lie just beyond your window.

And those diversions you do find will offer no relief –

[The safehouse creaks.]
– but simply numb the mind into mournful nostalgia for a time when the world you inhabited seemed to make sense.

[The safehouse creaks. The outside howls.]
Something moves outside, struggling to crawl upon a hundred reaching, grasping hands. It shudders, and grips the earth, pulling itself along as nails rip free and skin scrapes loose. It is afraid of what it has become and where it might be going.

[The safehouse creaks.]
Close your eyes.

[The static subtly acquires another, whiter layer, higher and hissing.]
Ignore the sounds. You, at least, are safe.

[The safehouse creaks.]
There, within the thing that pretends to be a cabin, is the one you love. You hold each other –

[Creak.]
– whisper words of reassurance, but the place knows this comfort to be a lie, and laces upon it instead the awful fear of losing what you have.

[The safehouse is now creaking continuously over his words.]
Of it being stripped away by the chaos that waits for you beyond the walls.

Hold each other, it croons. Be happy. But know always that this happiness is a lie, built on the squirming bones of those whose suffering you have caused.

It will not let you feel the warmth and joy that this love may claim to gift. (lower) It is only a moldy treasure to be clung to. Something to fear the loss of as you hold it so tight that it withers and warps.

It is a rotten sanctuary of lonely companionship.

Outside it is raining. Heavy drops fall, ice-cold and laced with salt. Tears of voyeuristic delight from the eyes that see and drink in all.

It sinks, into the dry, cracked ground, and from the mud faces struggle to push themselves free and breathe. They cannot reach the surface, as the slick soil flows down their throats.

Look closer at the rough planks that make this cabin, and see that they are warmer, softer and more yielding than the hard timber they present. Are the dimensions of this place quite what they were when you stayed here before the change?

Or are the walls thicker, the doors heavier when they close? Were the curtains always stained that dull maroon? Or has the dust of the horrific world they keep at bay dyed them so.

The one you love is always near, so close that refuge sometimes feels a prison. And yet your voice does not echo when you call to them. And they find they sometimes cannot hear it.

[The static begins to intensify again.]
Stay, the cabin says.

[A clap of thunder!]
Stay within my false defenses, cling so close to what you desperately wish to save, and live in shaking fear of the things beyond that may take it from you. Throw another log on the fire and curl up close. There are always more logs for the fire here.

This is your home, and here you can be safe, as you putrefy, body and soul.

This place wishes to be our tomb. But the Eye does not wish that.

[Rumbling. The static intensifies yet again.]
No, the Eye wishes instead that it be my chrysalis.

It is time that I emerge.

ARCHIVIST
Ah-ah!

[Something falls to the floor and/or knocks against a table. Possibly the Archivist. The static recedes slightly. Martin opens a door and we hear him come in. The soft fire that’s been crackling for a while is a little more obvious now, though it’s still in the background.]
MARTIN
John? Is it – I thought I heard – are you – are you okay?

ARCHIVIST
I,ye– yes, I (sigh) I think so.

MARTIN
What happened? The tapes, were y–

ARCHIVIST
I, I was listening, and, i-it- it was the one with – Tim and, and Sasha, uh, where they’re –

MARTIN
Yeah, y-yeah. (soft) Yeah. (shaky breath) Look, John, I – I know it hurts, but you’ve just got to –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) No, no – O,Oka– (stops, starts over) I, I was listening, and I, I was filled with this… hatred. This anger; I, I wanted to leave (heh) and hunt down Elias, uh, and –

MARTIN
(overlapping) Uh – w,wow, okay.

ARCHIVIST
But when I thought it, th-there was – there was something else.

[The safehouse creaks.]
ARCHIVIST
Th-This place, it – it didn’t want me – it didn’t want us- to go.

MARTIN
What do you mean?

ARCHIVIST
This cabin.

[It creaks.]
ARCHIVIST
It’s not right.

[It creaks some more.]
ARCHIVIST
And when I thought that, I-I felt – (inhale) It, it all poured out of me, down into the tape. I, I, I – and it –

[Martin sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
– felt good. I-It felt right.

MARTIN
Okay. (pause) So you’re recording again?

ARCHIVIST
I – I might need to. If we’re going to make it.

[Creeeak.]
MARTIN
(genuinely surprised) Back to the Archives?

ARCHIVIST
Seems the best place to start.

MARTIN
Oh – (surprised exhale) Y,yeah, alright!

[The safehouse keeps creaking in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin, it’s going to be a hard journey. One in which w–

MARTIN
(fast, excited) Yeah, yeah, yeah, so – I’ve actually had a couple of bags packed for a while now.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Oh!

[Martin starts getting out said bags as he speaks.]
MARTIN
(overlapping) Um, I found some rope in the attic,

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Okay –

MARTIN
(overlapping) and I packed that with the maps.

ARCHIVIST
(audible smile) Uh, Martin –

[We hear Martin zipping/unzipping things over this conversation.]
MARTIN
No, no, no; I – I know what you’re going to say, (put-upon Spooky John impression) What good are maps when the very Earth has… eh, blah blah blah.

ARCHIVIST
W,w,well yes.

MARTIN
(on a roll) But I, I packed them anyway, because you never. Know.

ARCHIVIST
(fond) Martin.

MARTIN
I – I actually – (heh) I actually found a stash of tea under the kitchen sink – I –

[Fond sigh from the Archivist.]
MARTIN
I realize we don’t need to eat, or – whatever, but, you know, that doesn’t mean that we won’t –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping, extremely fond) Yes – Yes, yes, it – alright. Alright.

[Sounds of movement.]
MARTIN
We’ve got this.

[One of them sorts through all the stuff Martin’s got ready.]
ARCHIVIST
(audible smile) Apparently so.

[More rummaging sounds.]
MARTIN
D’you think it’ll do anything? Confronting Elias?

[The rummaging continues.]
ARCHIVIST
I – (sigh) Maybe?

MARTIN
No, I’m serious – Do we –

[One last sound of movement, and then it stops.]
MARTIN
Is there a chance that we can undo this?

[The fire crackles.]
ARCHIVIST
(large inhale, then exhale) Gertrude didn’t think so.

[The safehouse creaks.]
MARTIN
Right.

ARCHIVIST
But she’s dead. (inhale) Let’s find out for ourselves.

[He hoists up something, or many things; we hear the contents slide around a bit.]
MARTIN
You’re – taking the recorder?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, just in case I need to – vent. Again, it – (inhale) it helps.

MARTIN
(heavy inhale/exhale) Okay.

[He picks up something of his own – his bag.]
MARTIN
You said this place – the, the cabin was – it – it’s feeding on us, right?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
So, should we destroy it? Before we go?

[The cabin creaks very loudly.]
ARCHIVIST
I honestly don’t know if we can.

[He sighs.]
MARTIN
Mm.

ARCHIVIST
Besides, there’s – far worse out there. Better to try and avoid it, I think.

MARTIN
We’re not even gonna try? Look, we’ve got your lighter; maybe if we just –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) We can’t fight the world, Martin.

[A little breath of a laugh from him.]
MARTIN
(hmph) Says you.

[The Archivist exhales.]
ARCHIVIST
Let’s go.

[We hear them grab their stuff. The world howls on outside.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SCOTLAND, AROUND KINLOSS]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Footsteps, on grimy, almost wet ground. In the background, wind is howling.]
[An exhale.]
MARTIN
Oh, I’m knackered.

ARCHIVIST
Are you?

MARTIN
I –

[They both stop.]
MARTIN
Hm.

[He takes another step, then stops again.]
MARTIN
Well – Okay, well, no, no; I suppose not. But I think I should be.

ARCHIVIST
Yep.

MARTIN
How long have we been walking?

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Fourteen hours and twenty-three minutes.

[He takes a step.]
MARTIN
What, seriously?!

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I – don’t think it means much out here, though.

MARTIN
We should probably rest.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe – I don’t know, I – I don’t know if we can. Rest. It – feels more like, well – waiting.

[He sighs. They both take a few more steps.]
[Another sigh.]
MARTIN
…So. Are we going to walk all the way to London?

ARCHIVIST
(a bit of a laugh) If you know an alternative, I’d be very keen to hear it.

MARTIN
I mean – cars? You know, planes, trains, automobiles?

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) It wouldn’t help.

MARTIN
Alright, a boat then.

ARCHIVIST
Geography doesn’t work anymore. Space, i– doesn’t work.

MARTIN
Alright. So what does that mean?

ARCHIVIST
It means the journey will be the journey, regardless of how we choose to make it.

MARTIN
Right. And you’re sure we can’t just, you know –

[Another shuffle.]
MARTIN
Speed it up a bit?

ARCHIVIST
(inhale) No.

[He exhales heavily.]
MARTIN
Right. I just – Don’t like being out here.

ARCHIVIST
(heh) You see that tower, way off in the distance?

MARTIN
(don’t like where this is going) Yeah. (beat, sigh) It’s watching us, isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
The Panopticon and the Institute. Merged into something entirely new.

MARTIN
(splutter-scoff) Wai– what? No, there’s, there’s no way we can see it from here. We – We must still be a hundred miles from the border, never mind London!

ARCHIVIST
You could see that tower from anywhere on Earth. And it can see you. And if you walk towards it, eventually you’ll get there. But you have to go through everything in between.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
(bright) You’re being ominous again.

ARCHIVIST
(ah!) Sorry. Sorry.

MARTIN
What do you mean ‘everything?’ What’s out here?

[The Archivist inhales. As he does so, there’s a sort of creaking – and then we hear the weakest strains of bagpipes beginning to fade through.]
ARCHIVIST
Nightmares. Come on, that trench is our first.

[He starts walking.]
MARTIN
What tre–? Where did that…? Why is that here?

ARCHIVIST
In the world as was, we wouldn’t be too far from Kinloss Barracks. So instead, we get the trench.

MARTIN
How’d you know all this stuff?

ARCHIVIST
Not sure. I just do.

MARTIN
(quieter) John. I’m scared.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. (sigh) That’s the idea.

[They start walking.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SCOTLAND, AROUND KINLOSS, THE TRENCH, A BIT LATER]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The bagpipes are much louder. We’re in the middle of the action. There are guns being shot and bullets flying and all around, the clattering of war. Grenades. Explosions. Any voices need to shout to be heard over the racket.]
MARTIN
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

ARCHIVIST
Martin! Stay with me; don’t let go!

MARTIN
Oh…

ARCHIVIST
Come on!

MARTIN
Shit, shit, shit –

ARCHIVIST
It’s okay.

MARTIN
No!

ARCHIVIST
You’re okay!

MARTIN
I don’t know [unintelligible], okay? This is not okay!

ARCHIVIST
Listen, come on!

[He groans, clearly straining with effort. There’s scraping, the sound of something driving off – and they’re both left heaving breaths in the aftermath.]
[The sound of war is still present in the background; there’s still a light flute over everything.]
ARCHIVIST
(still regaining breath) Are you –

MARTIN
(still shaky, voice wet) I’m fine, fine; I’m just – How, how about you; you’re not hurt?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… (checks) No. No, I’m not.

MARTIN
(overlapping) Good. Good. (space) Good.

[He exhales, then –]
MARTIN
(!) J, J,J-John. John. We’re not alone.

ARCHIVIST
Ignore them; they’re, they’re not – Just ignore them.

[Still shouts and roars in the background. Martin’s still breathing quickly.]
MARTIN
They’re not – real?

ARCHIVIST
(humorless laugh) No, they’re real. They were normal people before the –

Before me. (exhale) But now they’re here, meat for the grinder. I just mean there’s no point – talking to them.

MARTIN
(overlapping) Don’t be a prick, John. (to the people) Hey, I’m – I’m sorry about him; he’s, he’s going through a lot – well, we all are, I suppose, but – hi, I guess.

[No response.]
MARTIN
Hello?

ARCHIVIST
They won’t hear you, Martin. They’re all – too busy waiting to die.

MARTIN
John…

ARCHIVIST
They sit here –

[A rumbling, deep static begins to build.]
ARCHIVIST
– the image of everyone they hold dear locked in their mind, knowing they’ll never see them again. Waiting for the order.

[As he speaks, the higher, shinier component of the Archivist’s static begins to come in, initially at a low fade but rising quickly.]
ARCHIVIST
Dreading the bullet or the drone or the barbed wire that will tear them to shreds and leave them nothing but a bloody –

MARTIN
J,John, enough – Enough!

[The static fades out. Something is fired in the background.]
MARTIN
Please don’t tell me these things.

ARCHIVIST
I – I’m sorry, I – There’s just so much.

There’s so much, Martin, and I know all of it – I can – see all of it, and I – it’s filling me up; I need to let it out!

[His voice gains in intensity as he says it; it’s also beginning to shake. Martin is firm, though:]
MARTIN
I’m sorry, but tough. Okay, th-that’s not what I’m here for.

I can’t be that for you; I, I-I just. Can’t.

ARCHIVIST
(softer) I-I know. (beat, sigh) I’ll, I’ll use the tape recorder.

[We hear the rattling of its plastic as he begins to get it out.]
ARCHIVIST
I just – (heavy sigh) You’ll probably want to wait outside.

MARTIN
(sorry, did you just lose the last remaining brain cell????) Um, no?

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Well, put your fingers in your ears, then, I, I suppose.

[Martin pffts, then sighs.]
MARTIN
Fine, and what about them?

ARCHIVIST
They don’t even know we’re here. We’re not part of their nightmare.

[Something drips.]
MARTIN
Right.

[It drips again. Presumably Martin puts his fingers in his ears at this point. Whatever it is keeps dripping as the Archivist speaks.]
ARCHIVIST
(testing) Martin? (slightly louder) Martin? (one more test) Martin, I hate your tea, and wish you made coffee instead. (hm) Alright then.

[He sighs heavily. All at once, the static from earlier comes rushing right back in as if it had never left.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
There is a wound in the earth.

A bayonet gouge scored through the soft and sodden mud for uncounted miles. A trench that marks the front line of a war that has no name. It has always been raging, deep in the hearts of the powerful and those that thirst to see bodies piled high in their name.

And now it has a battleground. A thousand pointless conflicts and bitter stalemates stitched together like a triaged chest wound.

It is a butchered border, a thin and punctured membrane between the unending meat grinder and the terrified victims it longs for.

You may find this trench reaching all across the world, and it will never stop, never be satisfied, never think of peace.

Charlie stands there, waiting in a transport.

Once, it was a thin metal landing craft, drifting slowly through a fetid lake. The waters were red and black by turns with blood and oil and the floating bodies of those before them, that were pushed aside by the boat’s wake.

Next to him, Charlie saw Ryan, who he’d known since childhood, though the other details were hazy. Ryan gave him a thumbs up and an encouraging smile – before his face exploded inwards to a sniper’s bullet, peppering the boat with shards of bone and gore.

Charlie swallowed, and waited as the bullets kept coming and those around him died but did not fall, propped up as they were by the pressing mass of people around them.

He could not move, and as he waited for the shot that would take him, his legs fell away in fear.

Now he is in a helicopter, strapped in tight and unable to move. The man in the gunner’s chair is dead, bound limp in his seat harness, half his jaw gone. The thump-thump-thump of the rotors pulses through Charlie like a toothache, and he cannot hear the shouts and cries of his comrades.

He looks out of the side as a telltale line of smoke arcs up and around towards them from the scorched earth far below. He cannot hear his own scream.

He lies upon the ground, amid the twisted wreckage of whatever he was trapped in, feeling the jagged shards of broken bone dig into him.

Charlie looks up, and sees something floating there, silently. It is sleek, and merciless, its featureless carbon-fiber face regarding the shattered man dispassionately. The drone’s camera blinks once, twice as he tries desperately to crawl away, pain lancing through every part of him.

The thing makes no sound as it follows him, matching the excruciating pace of the bleeding soldier. Charlie knows when it decides to fire, he won’t even hear it.

He places his hand down and it sinks, suddenly, into the mud. He cries out as the rusted barbed wire curls itself eagerly around his wrist, digging into his skin.

Tasting fear, more wire slithers through the churned earth towards him, stretching and gripping him tight, rough needles puncturing his legs and chest and throat, pulling him down and holding him steady as the drone lingers, its blankness giving no hint of the thoughts behind its trigger.

There is a rumbling in the earth around him as a tank speeds along its unstoppable path, and Charlie is immediately pulled under its tread.

He has a moment of shocked horror before being reduced to a smear in the mud.

Inside the tank, Ishaan screams.

Ishaan remembers the recruiters. He was promised valor, and camaraderie, and the chance to be part of something meaningful. He knew that part had been a lie, but then – so was the choice. His alternative was stagnant poverty, and that was really no choice at all.

The money would help his family, and he could spend some years in hell, if he needed to. For them.

But he didn’t know about this war, that had always been raging and would never stop. How could he have known what the trench would be?

They had taken him, dragged him from the flooded foxhole where he had sheltered for a moment’s brief respite, and taken him to the tanks, those monstrous beasts of iron that rolled forever forward, guns firing and treads leaving the earth scarred in their wake.

They pass above the trench again and again and they never turn around, pushing onward, ever onwards, the bones that stick in their gears not slowing them for a moment.

Ishaan had been afraid. Terrified that they were going to strap him to it, pin him to the Goliath’s hull like all the other flayed flags of war, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy.

But instead they fed him to it, tossed him into its burning innards and sealed the hatch behind him.

Now, his body has contorted itself to fit, his fingers clutched around the firing lever; pulling it frantically is the only thing that will reduce the impossible heat even for a moment.

From the tiny slit in the metal, he can see other soldiers: baby-faced friends and the monstrous, pig-faced enemy, both falling underneath his iron coffin’s advance.

He tries to cry, but his tears turn to steam.

He waits, craving and dreading the final kiss of the bombs, the terrible thundering guns so far away that none have ever seen them, raining their arbitrary ruin upon the endless fields of the dead and dying.

They are perhaps the only things that can fell the tanks, splitting them like rotten fruit beneath the force of their rounds.

Ishaan begs, pleading with whatever god of hatred and pain he hears piping gently on the breeze to let the bombs rain down on him. To release him from his imprisonment in a single flash of destruction.

But when his prayer is answered, the white-hot agony of melted and crumpled metal is like nothing he could dream of.

When Hasana takes him into triage, she can barely bring herself to look at him.

She wheels his stretcher to its place in the stinking, vaulted tent that serves as a field-hospital, walking through a sea of bandages and around the piles of festering gauze.

She leaves the shuddering man and approaches a nearby doctor, its long form crouched over the open chest of a patient, its many hands a frenzy of scalpel, bonesaw, and needle as it giggles beneath its surgeon’s mask.

She wants to ask about the wounded, about what to do, where to put the new ones, how to help them, but even if her voice was not drowned out by the thousand-strong chorus of moaned and pained yelling that fills the tent, the doctor doesn’t seem to notice her.

Hasana’s eyes fall on the entrance to the tent, and she sees the line of civilians, stretching away into the distance. They are no less maimed, their agonies no more bearable, but there is simply no room.

She tries to apologize, but instead she closes the tent.

As she does so, she sees the trench behind her, and, not for the first time, Hasana considers trying to run.

But there is no mercy for deserters here. On one side of the trench the hungry guns of the vile enemy wait. And on the other, the just guns of heroes will cut you down no slower, save perhaps a breath to call you coward.

So she waits there, in the middle, with the weeping, wounded, and the soon to be dead. Waiting for the enemy to overrun them.

Sometimes, in the distance, Hasana sees them. The enemy, their skin rough, dark, and scaly; their faces twisted around cruel tusks, viciously sharpened teeth, and a pair of beady red eyes. Their lips are smeared crimson with the blood of children, and their greatest delight is to pluck the eyes of the innocent with their bayonets.

To call them monsters is the simple truth. They feel no pain, no remorse, and seek nothing but carnage.

Sometimes, in the distance, Hasana can even see an enemy triage tent, almost identical in appearance to her own. She can only imagine the atrocities that must take place inside.

Far in the distance, she sees Alexei look out over the battlefield, and her stomach turns at the detestable wrongness of his face.

Alexei in turn looks out from deep in the trench. He catches sight of the enemy, their shriveled rat-like heads causing the bile to rise in his throats.

He is bored. The boredom is the worst part, the part that erodes his will and drops him to despair.

There is nothing to do, nowhere to be. The only thing to occupy his mind is the inevitability of the next attack, the next order to charge, the next dropping bomb.

There is no way to know when and where these things will come. But no one will talk of anything else.

His stomach growls, the hunger pushing its sharp fingers out from his belly. There are no more rations, and what there is tastes of cordite and sand, and coats his tongue in an oily film that makes him gag.

He has heard the enemy will eat your body if they find it in the mud. They won’t even check if you’re dead first. Alexei shudders at the thought.

From far down the trench, a cry of panic cuts through the silence. A faint haze can be seen in the distance, moving with the breeze. A new weapon?

Alexei feels his knees start to buckle as he sees his comrades stagger out of the cloud. Their melting teeth flow down their faces like tears, and their limbs begin to fold and collapse as the bones within them liquefy.

He turns and starts to flee down the trench. There is no cruelty so foul the enemy will not perpetrate it.

He runs almost headfirst into a portly man in a tailored suit with a blood-red flower on his lapel. He smiles, pale skin splitting beneath his bristling white mustache, and he begins to shake Alexei by the hand.

“Good lad,” he says. “Good lad. Heroes one and all. A noble sacrifice.”

Alexei starts to speak, to say he doesn’t want to be a hero; he doesn’t want to be a sacrifice; he wants to go home. But the man with the flower reaches his hand into the soldier’s chest, and with a single, jolly motion, plucks out Alexei’s heart and places it in his wallet.

Next to his bleeding corpse, Charlie wakes from what passes for sleep in this place. A sergeant is yelling at him, screaming for him to take his gun and get into the waiting transport. There’s about to be another attack, and heavy losses are expected.

A familiar fear courses through him, but Charlie still picks up his gun, and goes back to the war.

[The Archivist sighs heavily.]
ARCHIVIST
I, um.

[He sighs heavily, mutters something garbled.]
ARCHIVIST
End recording.

[He clears his throat. From somewhere near him, Martin hms.]
MARTIN
All done?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

[When he speaks, his voice is still a bit shaky.]
MARTIN
Good.

[The bagpipes are still playing, though they sound much further in the distance.]
[The Archivist and Martin are trying to make their way through what sounds like water.]
ARCHIVIST
(calling) Try to keep up!

MARTIN
(long-suffering) Yeah, yeah.

[He pffts out an exhale, keeps making his way forward until –]
[He notices the tape recorder.]
MARTIN
Oh! Oh, hey – John! Did you – (stops himself) No. No, he was carrying his.

[He inhales heavily.]
MARTIN
Alright! (exhale) (to the recorder) What’re you doing here? It’s dangerous. Could – get yourself blown up, like all these poor…

[He trails off. It sounds like he’s picked up the recorder by now.]
MARTIN
Who d’you think they were? Really don’t see why we couldn’t just – go ‘round, picked a better place to –

[He stomps a bit heavier in the “water.”]
MARTIN
I guess there – aren’t really any better places anymore, are there? It’s all this, or worse, or – or different.

[More splashy-stomping sounds.]
MARTIN
You still haven’t told me what you’re doing here.

[And exactly at that moment, a phone rings. It’s not the tinny, electronic sound of a cellphone – no, this is a true, heavy, classic ring.]
MARTIN
Uh. (beat) (calling) John? Uh, J, John – the, uh, payphone that’s – here, for some reason – it’s ringing?

[The Archivist doesn’t respond. The phone keeps ringing.]
MARTIN
John? Is, Is that – (to the world at large) I-Is anyone gonna get that?!

[No one does. The phone keeps ringing. Martin takes a step in the water.]
MARTIN
Unless it’s for me?

[Ring.]
[Martin sighs, one that says ‘of course.’]
MARTIN
(resigned) Yeah, it’s for me. (beat of indecision) Uh –… no. (to the phone) N, no; I don’t think so, actually! Erm, thanks, but that – that sounds like – a really – terrible idea. Hm, sorry!

[We hear him in the water. The phone stops ringing.]
MARTIN
Huh. (pause) …Weeell, alright then!

[The Archivist stomps over through the water towards him.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin, you need to keep up. It’s not safe. (beat) (MORE)

Martin? You okay?

MARTIN
Uh, I – Th-th-there was a phone. That phone.

ARCHIVIST
(quiet surprise) Wh– Oh.

MARTIN
(overlapping) It – Yeah, it was ringing?

ARCHIVIST
(even more surprise) Oh. …Right. Did you answer it?

MARTIN
No.

ARCHIVIST
Hm. (beat) Probably for the best.

MARTIN
…Yeah.

[A brief beat, in which the Archivist takes a breath.]
ARCHIVIST
Let’s keep going.

Mm.

[This is territory of the Corruption.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
There is a sickness in this village. Perhaps you would not see it from a distance, and the faint sting of rot on the breeze is easy enough to dismiss. But as you get closer, that infectious feeling of wrongness is harder and harder to shake.

The grass is not the green of nature, the buildings are warped by more than age, and the voices that come from behind the inhabitants’ masks are hoarse and wet.

They move with exaggerated casualness, a parody of idyllic village life. And when they have a break from weeping, they reassure each other how wonderful it is in their village, or at least how wonderful it used to be.

Each is covered from head to toe in thick black fabric, and they never, ever touch.

Take a deep breath.

The air feels thick and soupy in your lungs, swarming with a thousand contagions digging into you, begging for you to join the village:

It’s so quiet there, and everyone cares for each other, far from the din and compacted flesh of the city.

In the center, a maypole stands, mildewed strips of colored cloth hanging limply from it like shreds of ragged skin. The base of the pole is ashen and charred.

The disease itself is nothing special. It begins as a small patch of discolored skin, the tiniest blemish. Scrub it off, and it is gone! For a few hours, at least. But it returns again and again, and begins to spread, a mold with tendrils that burrow deep.

It ranges in color from rancid yellow and corpse-fat white to the dull, angry purple of a fresh bruise. It itches, and burns, and you can feel it growing and spreading inside you, looking for the core of you. At least until it worms its way into your bones.

Beneath the coat of each terrified citizen of this sick village lies a lurking possibility, a nightmarish suspicion of infectious constellations of hungry mildew, a mutating technical atlas of rotten and pockmarked flesh.

But who can know for sure? Their coats are oh, so thick.

There was never a time before the disease, no matter what the old bastards tell you. It has always been in the village, always festered in the dark corners where no one could stomach to check. Where good neighbors wouldn’t dream to speculate.

But those who live here will tell you different. From behind their masks those friendly voices will tell you how it used to be: clean, and hygenic, and always bathed in sepia sunshine. They know in the guts of them this sickness has come from outside, that it is those from beyond the village that have done this to them.

They brought it here, they whisper to each other in the unnamed pub, hunched and bloated over their pale and stinking beers, lifting their masks to take a mouthful, puce faces and frightened sneers exposed for just a moment.

They couldn’t leave us well enough alone. They wanted what we have, our perfect peaceful life, and so they dragged their sickness here and damned us all.

The patrons speak quietly, ‘cause who can say for sure if the face behind a mask is a good, honest village face – or a sickness-bearing harbinger from beyond?

And people do still come to the village, for however thick the paranoia, however terrible the disease, there are worse things beyond.

They are stopped, of course. Beaten and stripped and checked head to toe for any sign of infection. The village council sees to that. Most are uncontaminated, though that does little to save them, while others are already laced right through with fungus of their own.

A few are spared brutality, and treated with such cordial politeness you must have thought their inquisitors old friends. Though there seems on the surface no rhyme to such decisions, were you to look below their coats, you might see the patterns of their mold were matched.

It is, alas, those who are unblemished who suffer worst. So incomprehensible is it that any from outside could be clean, that there might be another source or vector, the inspectors devise another theory: An invisible infection. A hundred Typhoid Marys spreading mildew and decay.

They keep them in the post office, wrapped in chicken wire, prodded and jeered and watched. Should they begin to show signs of the rot, then maybe, just maybe, they can stay for now, though nobody will doubt that it was they brought the illness.

But if they stay clean, if they continue to act like they are better, like they are above the sickness that it is certain that they must have brought to the village, then that cannot be endured. So they are taken to the village green, and the scorch marks at the base of the maypole get darker.

The villagers stand on the green to watch, ignoring the bending of the grass as it tries to worm its way through their boots. They watch the screaming outsider as the fire purifies them, and inside feel the gnawing panic of their own secrets.

For how long ago did they really come to the village? How deep did their roots go? Do any of them truly remember? What if they are an outsider? What if they’re found out?

No. Such fears are to be quashed and swallowed; they must stand strong; they must stand together as one body against the mass of those beyond the village who would see them degraded and destroyed. They cannot allow such secret terrors to break their unity.

And the maypole watches over all.

There is no house in town that has not found itself marked with the red cross of plague, but paint is fleeting and the villagers are so desperate to hide their state. Night still falls here, if only to give those that wish it a chance to try and hide their frantic denials.

As the weak dawn breaks, you may count the doors now painted white, and see who is more conscientious in covering their spongy skin.

The deception is pitiable, and yet deep down every villager knows the mold has marked them deeper than any of the others, and carries it as their most secret shame.

Foremost in their denials are the village council, those loud and hardy souls who have taken it upon themselves to police this place, to safeguard their traditions and denounce the infection that is the right and proper punishment of those who would allow the village borders to be breached, and their ancient way of life to be compromised.

Their masks are blue and red and white, and their coats are the color of fresh ivory, stained sometimes with streaks of crimson from their dutiful ministrations. None would dare accuse them of infection, and to cross them or draw their eye is to invite the strongest diagnosis.

Head of the council is Jillian Smith. Her father’s father’s father’s father’s father built the maypole, carved from a jackalberry tree and painted in the colors of the village. This place is her home and her right and her duty, and woe to any fungus-riddled outsider who might believe it otherwise.

For no one would speak up if Jillian Smith were to mark you infected or declare you foreign. No one would lift a finger as they dragged you to the green.

Her gloves are purest white and never sullied, and they hide a cerulean mold that covers every inch of her, through skin, muscle, and organ, though she has no idea it runs so deep.

By night, she sits in the quiet darkness of her perfect cottage, peeling herself with a straight razor, layer by layer, desperate to reach the pure flesh she is so sure must still be in there, somewhere.

Her living room is the same suffocation blue as the rest of her, every surface piled high with her own discarded bloody skin, and she has no terror deeper than the thought she might be discovered. As she pulls spongy strips free one agonizing fiber at a time, she stares from the window at the house of her neighbor, Mrs Kim.

Mrs Kim is not on the village council. Mrs Kim keeps to herself. And Jillian Smith is certain Mrs Kim is not infected, and hates her for it.

What Mrs Kim is, is scared. Scared of her neighbors, scared of her friends, scared of the moment when someone will smell the spreading patch of darkness on her back, and decide she is infected, or remember she has only been in the village since her grandfather’s day, and judge her to be an outsider.

Should she accuse someone else? Send them to the village green? Perhaps she might petition to join the village council, though that would invite their attention as much as anything might.

Even through the masks, Mrs Kim knows the looks she gets in the pub. But what can she do?

When she hears the shouts outside and sees the smoke pouring from the thatch roof, she knows it is too late.

They drag her to the maypole, their masks hiding the tears of terror and angry shame, and lash her there with those strips of cloth that never seem to burn.

Mrs Kim does not fight, though she screams and screams and screams as all her fears are realized. Jillian Smith tries to smile as she watches her neighbor burn, but the fungus is too thick around her lips, and her face no longer moves.

As the flames consume the last of Mrs Kim in thick and acrid smoke, the mold reaches the bones of Jillian Smith, and she blooms.

In a moment she is swollen, bloated, bursting into a cloud of violet spores that envelop the green and those who dwell there, embracing them in a rot that long since seeped into the soil of this blighted land.

[The Archivist takes a deep breath and then exhales.]

[The sounds of the Corruption are in the distance now, though the fly in particular still manages to stick out.]
ARCHIVIST
We’re fine.

MARTIN
A-Are we? I mean, that place is – (sputters) I don’t, I don’t feel fine, okay, and you were there a long time doing your,y– (how to phrase this?) – your guidebook, which, you know, I get it, but that place is –

[Some movement.]
MARTIN
I,It’s infectious, and… I don’t –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) We’re not infected, Martin; that place – (stop, exhale) It isn’t for us.

MARTIN
A, Alright – but how do you know? –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) I just – Do. I just know it.

[Silence. Some movement.]
MARTIN
You’ve been Knowing a lot, lately.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
A lot more than you used to.

ARCHIVIST
Ye…Yeah.

[By now, we can no longer hear the sounds of the Corruption’s village, just the standard howling wind of this universe’s fearscape.]
ARCHIVIST
And it, and it feels more – deliberate. Like I have more control now.

MARTIN
Okay.

[A step.]
MARTIN
So – How much can you see? What else do you know?

ARCHIVIST
Uhh… (step, genuine surprise) Maybe everything.

MARTIN
What’d’you mean, “everything?”

ARCHIVIST
I don’t – Ask me a question! One I can’t possibly know already.

MARTIN
O-kay… (step) What’s my middle name?

[The Archivist hms. His static begins to rise.]
ARCHIVIST
(!) Y– You don’t have one!

MARTIN
(impressed) Whoa.

ARCHIVIST
You – I actually believed you!

[The static starts to fade.]
MARTIN
(overlapping) Oh – S-Sorry; sorry, I just, I just wanted to try it out-

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) “That’s ridiculous,” I thought, “That’s not a real name, but he wouldn’t lie to me.”

MARTIN
(caught red-handed) Okay – okay, okay, okay. Let’s – Let’s try something a little bigger, then.

ARCHIVIST
Alright.

[Step.]
MARTIN
Is Basira alive?

[The Archivist inhales sharply.]
MARTIN
Is she in – o,one of these places?

[The static rises, quicker than before.]
ARCHIVIST
She’s alive. Out there, not trapped in a, in a, a hellscape, but – moving. Hunting.

She’s – She’s looking for Daisy. She’s a few steps behind.

MARTIN
And Daisy?

[Static intensifies.]
ARCHIVIST
…Beastial. Brutal. Carving her way through the domains of other Powers, following the scent of blood –

[He sighs, and there’s a note of – guilt? Regret? Pity? To it.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh, Daisy, I’m sorry.

MARTIN
What’s Basira going to do?

ARCHIVIST
She – (movement) – thinks she’s going to kill Daisy. Like she promised. But she’s conflicted.

MARTIN
(immediate) And will she?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know; th-the future, th, th,that’s… not something I can see.

MARTIN
O-kay, good to know. How much further do we still need to go?

ARCHIVIST
A long way.

[The static kicks back up into a higher register. When the Archivist speaks, his voice is closer to his Statement Voice – lower register, more distanced from what he’s saying, like a narrator.]
ARCHIVIST
Through many dark and awful places.

MARTIN
(catching the change) Is this – A-Are you okay? How are you feeling?

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) I – Um, I, I’m okay. It’s a little – strange? But it doesn’t hurt.

Keep going; you have – questions, let’s hear them.

MARTIN
Oh, oh, okay, um. How are the others?

ARCHIVIST
I, uh. (pause) Hm. I’m – I’m not – sure. I can’t really see Melanie, or, or Georgie.

MARTIN
They’re dead?

ARCHIVIST
No, no – I, I don’t think so; if they were dead, I – I think I would know that, I just – (rustling) I don’t know – where they are, w,what they’re doing.

MARTIN
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) London, maybe?

MARTIN
What about Elias?

ARCHIVIST
(immediate, darker) He’s inside the Panopticon. The tower, far above the world.

MARTIN
(joke) That one?

ARCHIVIST
(misses/doesn’t care for it) Yes.

[He sighs.]
MARTIN
(as if asking after an old friend) How is he?

ARCHIVIST
Hard to say. The, The way this works, this – new sight, the knowledge is, is… (sigh) somehow wrapped up in the Panopticon? (sigh) An eye can’t – see inside itself.

[Martin hms.]
ARCHIVIST
But I can feel him in there.

MARTIN
Hm. That sounds… gross.

ARCHIVIST
It is.

[They both laugh.]
MARTIN
Are we safe, traveling like this?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. (brief pause) Yes, sort of, we’re – (exhale) I don’t know how to phrase it, we’re – something between a pilgrim and a moth. We can walk through these little worlds of terror, watching them. Separate, and untouched.

MARTIN
That’s not as comforting as you might think.

[He gives a little laugh as he says it. The Archivist laughs with his next words, too.]
ARCHIVIST
I like it better than the alternative.

MARTIN
Fair point! (small laugh) Okay, okay, uh – what else, what else, um… Oh! Um, uh, who was – um, uh – phone! Who was calling me?

[The Archivist’s static comes noticeably back in.]
ARCHIVIST
(inhale) …I think it was Annabelle Cane.

MARTIN
Hm.

ARCHIVIST
That’s – weird; I – I know the Web was wrapped around that phone, but, but I can’t – see her. A, At all. At least with Georgie and Melanie I have a vague sense they’re still alive, i-in London, and o– well, what was London.

But Annabelle? Nothing.

MARTIN
Hm. W, Well, I’ll… I’ll ask her, next time she calls.

ARCHIVIST
(amused) Well, I know that’s a bad idea.

MARTIN
(overlapping, fond, amused) What, do you?

ARCHIVIST
…Okay, no; that one was a – very reasonable guess.

MARTIN
Ha!

ARCHIVIST
(inhale) Anything else? I’ll, I’ll be honest, I’m starting to feel a bit – self-conscious being a post-apocalyptic Google?

MARTIN
Okay, okay, just one more, but – it’s a big one.

ARCHIVIST
(near-whisper) Okay.

[Movement, possibly the flip of a page.]
MARTIN
Can we turn the world back?

[The static takes off.]
ARCHIVIST
Whoa. Um. I-If the fears are removed, y,yes, but they c-can’t be destroyed while there are still people to fear them, th-then they can’t be banished back to the space where they came from; it,it’s not – there anymore, I, – Oh, uh –

MARTIN
J,J,Jo,J,John, what’s wrong?!

ARCHIVIST
Uh, i-it’s, uh – I’m sorry – trying to know things about them directly, i,i,it’s like – (exhale) God, it’s like looking into the Sun.

MARTIN
Okay, okay, okay. Alright, that’s alright. We can leave it.

[The Archivist exhales as he speaks.]
ARCHIVIST
Good. (inhale) Ow.

[He sighs.]
MARTIN
Hey. (small chuckle) Hey, it’s okay, it’s okay. We’ll go slow for a while.

ARCHIVIST
Alright.

MARTIN
Yeah. Yeah, there’s no rush.

[Pause as the Archivist sighs.]
MARTIN
Oh, actually – what about Helen, where’s she these days?

[Static kicks in again.]
ARCHIVIST
Uh – She’s –

[He laughs, dryly.]
ARCHIVIST
Right. Naturally.

[He sighs.]
MARTIN
What’s she doing?

ARCHIVIST
Martin, turn around.

[We hear him do just that.]
MARTIN
(fuck off) Oh, you’re kidding.

ARCHIVIST
Wish I was!

MARTIN
(sigh) Shall we… um…

ARCHIVIST
Do you want to do the honors?

MARTIN
(grimace) Not really!

[One of them knocks, a little knock-knock-knock.]
MARTIN
Maybe – no one’s home? –

HELEN
(overlapping) Hello, John!

[We hear her footsteps as she steps outside. They’re not on any gravel-type surface like Martin’s and the Archivist’s; instead they sound like she’s walking on wood or tile.]
ARCHIVIST
(sighing) How did you find us?

HELEN
Oh! I thought you’d know everything by this point.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, I suppose I do.

[There’s a definite note of amusement in his voice. Helen laughs, in that disorienting way of hers. The Archivist allows a small hm.]
MARTIN
(still here!) And I don’t! So, care to enlighten me?

ARCHIVIST
Oh – yes, sorry, uh – The Distortion can always find anyone who has – crossed its threshold.

HELEN
And that includes you, Martin! Remember? And please – my name is Helen.

ARCHIVIST
Like you said, I can know everything now, including how much of a lie that really is.

HELEN
Don’t mistake complication for falsehood, dear Archivist. And remember, that knowledge is not the same thing as understanding!

ARCHIVIST
What do you want.

HELEN
To say hello! And check up on the happy couple.

[She laughs again.]
HELEN
I always knew you crazy kids would make it work.

[The Archivist sighs as she speaks.]
MARTIN
Thanks.

ARCHIVIST
Martin. (to Helen) Look, I’ve no interest in your – gloating.

HELEN
(picture of innocence) What would I have to gloat about? Much as I am delighted by this brave new world in which we find ourselves, I can take no credit for it. This was all – you!

ARCHIVIST
(immediate) You could have – (inhale, reigning in) You knew what was happening.

HELEN
I suspected. But all I really did was refuse to help! And that is hardly a unique quality.

[Another sigh from the Archivist at her words.]
HELEN
If that makes it my fault, then surely this is Georgie’s fault as well, and Melanie’s –

ARCHIVIST
Leave them out of this, they didn’t know!

HELEN
There it is again! Knowledge! It’s so very important to you, isn’t it? These fossilized nuggets of pretend comprehension, weighing you down, stopping you thinking or feeling! What about hypotheticals? If they had known, what would they have done?

Is that something you can see?

ARCHIVIST
What. Do. You. Want!

HELEN
To be friends again! All three of us.

[Another sigh.]
HELEN
Look at this place, look at this – (inhales deeply) Wonderland.

This is the world, now, and we are strong and free! There’s really no reason for us not to hang out.

[A pause, silent but for the hollow ring of Helen’s tone and static.]
HELEN
(to Martin) (exhale) Goodness, he is in a mood. Has he been like this the whole time?

MARTIN
Not the – whole time.

HELEN
Thank goodness.

ARCHIVIST
Martin…

MARTIN
In fairness, he’s had a lot on.

HELEN
(sympathetic) Oh, I’m sure.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Martin… please.

MARTIN
Sorry, it’s just – maybe she can help!

ARCHIVIST
With what.

MARTIN
With our – With our, with our quest!

[The Archivist sighs.]
MARTIN
We’ve been walking a while, and well, her door’s – maybe we could, you know – shortcut!

ARCHIVIST
No. No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.

HELEN
I would happily take him. But I don’t think he’d want to leave you.

MARTIN
Okay, o,one – (hm) Don’t talk about me like I’m not here; it’s – rude. Two, I know you can take two people at once. Me and Tim were both inside the corridors when it –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Martin, it’s not that si-simple.

HELEN
I’m afraid the Archivist is too powerful now.

[A sigh through teeth.]
HELEN
If he tried to travel through my corridors it would not go well, for any of us.

ARCHIVIST
But mainly for you.

HELEN
(pleasant surprise) Ooo! Is that a threat?

ARCHIVIST
No.

HELEN
Mm, pity!

MARTIN
So, no shortcuts then. (sigh) Understood. (to John) I’m not leaving you on your own.

HELEN
Oh! Such devotion. (to John) You really don’t deserve it. But of course – you know that already!

[She laughs.]
HELEN
Oh, this is nice! I am really glad we get to spend some proper, quality time together now.

MARTIN
…Yeah.

HELEN
Anyway. Sorry to love you and leave you, but I must dash. It’s a very busy time for me, lots of things to do, people to – well. You know!

ARCHIVIST
I don’t doubt it.

[Tenuous pause.]
MARTIN
…What?

HELEN
Just taking a moment to look. You two are just such an adorable couple –

ARCHIVIST
Enough.

[Helen opens her door.]
HELEN
See you soon!

[We hear her footsteps as she walks into her corridors. The door swings shut behind her. The Archivist sighs yet again.]
MARTIN
(a bit sing-song) Maybe she’s right!

ARCHIVIST
I am not, nor have I ever been, “adorable.”

MARTIN
(pfft) Okay, not true. But I actually meant the whole – being friends thing? I mean, I don’t see why –

ARCHIVIST
Martin, she’s – a cruel, vicious monster!

MARTIN
Yes. Yes, she is. But who else is there?

[One last sigh from the Archivist.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE UK, A DIVISION OF THE STRANGER]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Immediately we hear the howling ruckus and music of a circus. It’s almost like we’re in the Unknowing again.]
MARTIN
Wow.

ARCHIVIST
I told you.

MARTIN
I mean, yeah, but when you said big –

ARCHIVIST
I meant big.

MARTIN
Yeah, but – I mean, how big is it, actually?

[A little heh as he says it.]
ARCHIVIST
I-It doesn’t really work like that.

MARTIN
Yeah, figures.

ARCHIVIST
If you tried to measure the diameter, I – uh – it’d probably only be a half mile or so.

But the curve doesn’t work quite right, and if you stayed in the same spot and just – hopped on a horse and let it carry you ‘round, it – might be… days before you passed the same spot, or, uh…

[There are distant screams – of joy? Of fear? It’s hard to tell – in the background as he speaks.]
MARTIN
(overlapping) Or you might never see the same spot again?

ARCHIVIST
(exhale) Exactly.

MARTIN
Yeah. (sigh) I think I’m starting to get it.

ARCHIVIST
Good.

MARTIN
But – you said we needed to go through these places. Is that even gonna work here?

ARCHIVIST
(squeaky breath) Uh – We need to go through them… metaphorically. Psychologically, we need to experience them.

[Something screams in the background.]
MARTIN
Hm. (slowly) You think we could – get – that experience just – walking along the edge? Because, uh – I really don’t like the look of those riders.

ARCHIVIST
Would you believe me if I said they were the victims?

MARTIN
At this point, I’m not even surprised.

ARCHIVIST
Either way, best not to actually climb onto the thing if we can help it.

MARTIN
Fine by me. (laugh) Never really liked merry-go-rounds anyway.

ARCHIVIST
No? You – gone on any recently?

MARTIN
What? No. No, I don’t think so. Not since I was a kid.

ARCHIVIST
(heh) I actually, uh… There’s one at London Zoo – uh, was one at London Zoo. Big old thing. Went quite fast, actually. Su-Surprisingly thrilling.

[As he says this, we hear Martin trying to contain his mirth. As soon as the Archivist finishes speaking, he lets out a large burst of laughter.]
ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
Seriously?!

ARCHIVIST
It was years back, before the Institute. I… I was in a weird place.

Had a good time, though!

[Martin laughs again, in surprised delight.]
MARTIN
Well.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, obviously I wouldn’t want to ride this one; we’ve got quite enough thrills already.

MARTIN
(teasing) You – Are you sure? I could speak to an attendant –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) I would advise – (softer) against doing that.

MARTIN
So you said the riders were the victims… where’s the monster?

ARCHIVIST
I’m hoping if we’re quick we can avoid her notice.

MARTIN
Her? (pause) J-John, please don’t tell me there’s an evil clown doll down there, because –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) No. N-No, Nikola died with the Unknowing; it’s, uh… (shaky inhale) an old friend.

MARTIN
(realizing) …Oh.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. I’d really rather not deal with her if we can avoid it.

MARTIN
Yeah, good call. Um – in that case, do you want to – do your thing now, then, before we start moving? Uh, are we close enough?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Yes, I-I think so. Good idea.

MARTIN
Thanks.

ARCHIVIST
You, uh. You might want to take a bit of a walk. This – feels like a strange one.

MARTIN
What does – “strange” mean, with something like this?

ARCHIVIST
Don’t think you want to know.

MARTIN
Good point! Um, okay, well, uh – good luck; I’ll be, uh – over there.

[We hear him walk off.]
ARCHIVIST
Right.

[Immediately, his static kicks in.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Your face is not your face is not your face around the curling carousel it twists in place to take from you and all the tattered stolen souls who sense of me is swollen and distended into nothing.

Round and round and round it goes and when it deigns to stop who you might be you cannot know, so touch and feel the skin atop your skull to test the limits and extremities of where this canvas comes to rest, in robbed identities and peeling names that you could swear were never yours.

[In the background, someone screams.]
The music swells through you. The music vomits from you. The music calls a name that through the tears of half-grasped memories seems almost and eternally familiar.

So dance. Dance to the beat of the thump of the chase of the still and plastic horse hooves which cannot break from where they are secured by bolts and glue and eggshell-thin reality that paints a visage of sense almost enough to tell you that the nausea that swells and pushes at the limits of your mind is incorrect.

There’s nothing wrong.

The world in which the carousel will twirl is not the hollow hell you fear; it is the world. Just the world. A world where if you’d wished to have a name it must be stolen, carved and pulled full-bloody from the frame of others who would wish in vain to hold their selfness close.

You want a face? Take it. There are so many here, and those who cannot hold them, well, whoever chose to give them such a gift must take the blame, knowing they could never keep it in a world of so much thieving strangeness.

And soon enough they will forget they ever even had one, rest assured; it’s best to step the dance and keep your face secured as much as you are able. Just. Keep. Running.

[More screams.]
Your feet – or are they just the shoes with emptiness within? – will pound upon the creaking wood of carousel-top, or perhaps the only ground there’s ever been, so struggle not to look behind, though – can you trust your eyes to tell you quite what it might be that dogs your steps and see the poor procession of those gory, faceless wretches who have lost possession now of all their treasured wants, identities to those who are now them?

Like you.

You tire of the chase of course, the fire and all-relentless pace of competition reaching for a name, identity, and face that has long since worn through all reserves of hard, enduring vigor in you. Yet still you only stay a self while willing on your aching legs that feel like breaking just to keep you forward of the frenzied fray of hazy clawed who are yous.

So run. Just run, and listen to the music of your panicked flight from those who long to take what you have stole from those no longer worth a name.

Ever-onwards-forward on the curling path of merry-go-round that’s twisted, wound, and spinning in its harrowing sound of organ-piping-circus-tunes that merrily hound the steps of your escape.

Could you turn a thought and burn your lead on your pursuers, an angle change a charge now perpendicular to your intended line of best retreat, and stake it all on one last hope, your bruised feet pounding to the edge?

The boundary. Don’t stop the ride, but you still want to get off.

But no, for all the dreams of bounding, leaping off into the great unknown, you see the ring of broken mewling wretches who have shown the sting that comes with such rejection of the truth, so seldom spoken yet inside you all- that there is no way off the merry-go-round.

And so perhaps the twirling round that pushes all who passenger the carousel might help you stay ahead, and so you seize the rough and peeling pole of ancient wooden horse, ignore the sloughing, screaming wood that comes away in clumps, and grip the saddle hard, in hands that should be clean but now have never seen a day they were not caked in glue and slaked with blood of all the robberies existence deems the only way to live.

Ride away. Just ride away.

Up it goes. Down it comes.

[That same shrill girl’s scream.]
Hold fast to the joy of the rise, despise all thoughts you might descend. And in the end, protest against that fall back down to painted wooden spinning earth, with all the tear-streaked grasping of the mass of gasping, still-unnamed oppressed.

Cry to the horse, Go higher! Faster, offer painted apples that you think perhaps it might desire, but the frozen face is still the same, the simple cast of equine terror, framed and caught in wood and plastic bulging eyes of fear.

Its pace remaining as it ever was; it does not care for coming pains as you are torn.

Doesn’t it know who you are?

No.

And soon, neither will you. (shaky breath) Although to call it “all is lost” is more dramatic, yes, than has been earned. For those upon this carousel who have not been you already, perhaps they know without a memory how good it is to have a face and name.

It’s not the same as what you had when first you climbed the brightly painted stairs, but not the worst who you have been. And as the horse drops through the air into the crowd of eager, waiting thieves you are unbowed and, yes, afraid, but still the music plays, and turns the world upon its gaudy axis.

You will be someone again, someday.

The hands and fingers reach and breach the gentle veiled complacency and respite that had just been yours upon your mount’s ascent, and now the wood is bent and bowed as faceless things who long to be a who pull splinters from the rot of screaming saddle and of rider.

You, who feels the mask of sharp and hard identity begin its gentle fracture into jagged shards of names that you once were.

I’m still Hannah! you try to scream, but are you? No. Perhaps there’s some Veronica as fragments there, or Julian, or Anya, but – no. You feel the last of names and who you might have been be torn away and borne towards new bodies. New pages, blank, determined to be people.

The rotten, ragged rush of fetid fingernails that dig and push and reach around the edges of your face until they scrape against the bone in such a rough, scratched tone, that rocks and echoes through the space that was your mind, and when they peel it from you, like the skin of an orange, the skin of an apple, the skin of a pig, the skin of a child, the skin of a you, then comes the briefest flash that surely now it’s done, so much perhaps the pain will be somewhat lessened.

There’s no way it could hurt as much as you remember.

But it does, and so, of course, you scream and scream and curses foul, obscene will tumble garbled over where there once sat other people’s lips or yours now gone and teeth that once shone yellowed ivory are crimson in the flowing sanguine flood.

And as you lie in agonies and fading dreams of personhood, of knowing who you were and what that might have meant, you hear the bitter whisper of recriminating seekers who have found the treasure of their eager dreams, but see, it seems there’s not enough. For all.

And so they fall to frantic tearing conflict, just as vicious as it was when it was bearing down on you. You lie there in the fugue of vivid pain and feel that gentle rain from violence overhead; some fall dead, or close as this place lets you lie, for – truly thus to die would be too eager an escape, and listen to the ebb and swell of slow, melodic wail that well you know conducts the flowing rhythm laced into this endless, faceless dance.

At last, a victor breaks away in clinging heartfelt terror of his former comrades, sprinting bold and holding to his skull the severed face that was once yours. Willing it to stick as those who notice try to pick themselves back up and give pursuit to close the gap.

Perhaps you should arise and follow on the things that once you would despise but now have joined. You are, of course, a faceless thing as well, and so should quickly match the pace of those who chase the self-same prey.

But now it is too late; they’ve gone. Their chase will not abate until their former friend is ripped apart in turn. And you have learned to wait.

For there are many faces out upon the carousel, and many names that you might be. So bide your time a while and wait the coming of another one whose fate and face might sit upon your grinning carmine skull.

So turn with the turn of the merry-go-round and dance to its jolly old song. Who will you be, with a name or three, and a stranger’s face worn wrong?

ARCHIVIST
End recording.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. THE DIVISION OF THE STRANGER]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[We still hear the circus music, loud and clear, along with a scream or two every now and then. The Archivist and Martin are still walking through the Stranger’s domain.]
MARTIN
You’re joking!

ARCHIVIST
(amused) I’m not.

[Brief pause.]
MARTIN
So was it any good?

ARCHIVIST
Uh – what do you mean?

MARTIN
Was it a good poem?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know! No? You’re the poetry expert, Martin, not me.

MARTIN
Well – did it stir any feeling in you?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, nausea! Because of the horrible things in it.

MARTIN
That’s not quite what I meant.

ARCHIVIST
(laughing) Then I don’t know what you mean, Martin; I’m not a poetry person, I don’t – get it. I never have.

MARTIN
(long-suffering) That’s – That’s fine; I understand.

ARCHIVIST
Look, I’m better than I was. I used to think all poetry was bad.

MARTIN
Sorry, what?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I just thought of – (small puff of a sigh) I sort of thought it was pointless. Just – (inhale) write some prose, and stop – wasting everyone’s time.

MARTIN
(thoughtful) Hm. What changed?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know, I just – mellowed on it, I suppose.

MARTIN
That’s – kind of weird.

ARCHIVIST
In my defense, there is a lot of bad poetry out there.

MARTIN
I guess?

[Brief moment of silence as they walk.]
MARTIN
I kinda want to hear that tape now, see how artistic the Stranger actually is.

ARCHIVIST
Or just look up. (sigh) See it for yourself.

MARTIN
Uh – (heh) No, no thanks. Trying to avoid thinking about it, actually.

[A very large, shrill girl’s scream.]
ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Of course. Sorry.

MARTIN
How much further?

ARCHIVIST
I think we’re past the worst of –

[A strange almost-musical humming sound.]
ARCHIVIST
(quiet) Ah.

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
She’s here.

[We hear a static begin to come in, rising quickly. It gets shimmery quick, holding a high quavering tone that belongs to something familiar. Under it:]
MARTIN
(quiet) Oh no.

NOT!SASHA
(heh) My dearest colleagues.

MARTIN
Just – get back!

[A thump, like he’s trying to hit it with something.]
NOT!SASHA
I can’t believe you’d decide to pass through my neighborhood and not say hello to dear, old Sasha.

ARCHIVIST
Just ignore it, Martin.

NOT!SASHA
Oh, you wound me, Archivist. And we used to be so close.

ARCHIVIST
I have nothing to say to you.

NOT!SASHA
Nothing to say! Well, you crush me, bury me in the foundations of your little temple for a year, and now you have nothing to say?

ARCHIVIST
Leitner did that. And Peter released you. All I’ve done to you is to not die.

NOT!SASHA
Oh, and I would say that is quite rude enough.

ARCHIVIST
Leave us alone. I won’t warn you again.

NOT!SASHA
And what if I let you choose this time? Which one of you would I wear next? Martin looks very comfortable, positively roomy. Oh, wouldn’t you agree, Archivist?

MARTIN
John, do we – do we need to run?

NOT!SASHA
Oh, yes, Martin. You very much do. I’ll even give you a head start!

[A pause. And then we realize the Archivist is laughing.]
MARTIN
…John?

[The Archivist begins to walk towards the Not!Sasha]
ARCHIVIST
You’re bold, I’ll give you that.

NOT!SASHA
(hissing) Last chance.

ARCHIVIST
Desperate for one last morsel of terror from us?

[The Not!Sasha snarls.]
ARCHIVIST
(amused) A final sip, and then we’re gone? Somehow we manage to keep just ahead of you and get away.

[It breathes out heavily, more angry huff than exhale.]
ARCHIVIST
God forbid you actually catch us.

[Its anger grows.]
ARCHIVIST
Doesn’t bear thinking about.

MARTIN
John, what are you talking about?

ARCHIVIST
She can’t touch us.

[The Not!Sasha continues to make noises of anger, growling and snarling and huffing like a bull.]
ARCHIVIST
We’re so far beyond her now. She’s just like everything else here: ruled by the Eye. (slight laugh) And she hates it.

[The Not!Sasha lets out something like a roar and begins talking: fast, angry, no hint of the syrupy sweetness from before.]
NOT!SASHA
Well of course you want to wallow in my shame like your voyeur master.

[That strange musical hum comes in again over her words.]
NOT!SASHA
Do you know how it feels? To be – anonymous? And yet known! To have all the sweetest dread I can create tainted by the relentless gaze of that damned Eye. I’ve suffered enough.

ARCHIVIST
Pathetic.

[A clinking, shuffling sort of sound; he shoulders his bag.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin, let’s go.

NOT!SASHA
Not as pathetic as your little friend when I ate her life.

[A drawn, dangerous pause.]
[The Archivist takes a step back to face it.]
ARCHIVIST
(low, deadly) What did you say?

[The Not!Sasha does not respond. A soft static bursts in, just in the background; instead, the Not!Sasha draws a sharp breath.]
NOT!SASHA
I-I’m sorry.

[In the background, the circus music shifts key, higher.]
MARTIN
John?

ARCHIVIST
You were wrong, you know.

[The static rises. The Not!Sasha cries out in pain, small, whimpering sounds. The Archivist’s voice and gaze are relentless.]
ARCHIVIST
There is more suffering than you can ever experience, so much more. The horror of your victims, their constant, senseless agony.

[The static builds and builds and builds over his words, the Not!Sasha forced to drink it in, crying out as the terror floods it.]
ARCHIVIST
Feel it now. Understand it. You have drawn out so much despair, and now finally, it’s your turn.

[The static reaches its upper register, the most scrambled of its tones. This isn’t the Archivist’s typical static; it doesn’t take an angelic quality. It’s squeaky, variable, similar to how Peter Lukas’s static sounded. It is stronger, harsher.]
[The Not!Sasha is sobbing.]
ARCHIVIST
Ceaseless Watcher, turn your gaze upon this wretched thing.

[The static pushes at the edges; it bounces, thumps, throbs in the ear. A new, lower-register segment has arrived; it sounds rather like a drill bit. This is the sort of static that, if louder and more intense, could blow out speakers, put pressure on the eardrum.]
NOT!SASHA
No! No, please, no!

[The static mounts and swells and bursts. It sounds like a glitch, like something wrongly heard.]
[The Not!Sasha screams a final wavering and distorted No! and then fades.]
[The static lingers briefly, but fades quickly after.]
MARTIN
(impressed) Who-a-oa.

ARCHIVIST
(quiet, drained) I, uh –

MARTIN
What was that?!

ARCHIVIST
I, I destroyed it. K-Killed her.

MARTIN
(a cross between pride and glee – hurrah!) Are you kidding me? You – you obliterated her! You – you smote her!

ARCHIVIST
(mumbling) We should go.

MARTIN
What about the merry-go-round? With her gone, is it – is it still the –

ARCHIVIST
(snapping) I don’t know!

MARTIN
Yes, you do!

ARCHIVIST
I, I don’t – want to know; pl– We need to go. Please.

[We hear one of them grab at bags.]
MARTIN
(surprise) Oh, oh, okay, a-alright, alright, lead on!

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE UK, NEAR A DIVISION OF THE BURIED]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Footsteps, crunchy as if on gravel. A strange dog-like howling in the distance.]
[The Archivist inhales and exhales deeply.]
MARTIN
…So, are we going to talk about it, or….?

[The Archivist exhales, and then stops walking; we hear the jangle of his bag(s) as he does so. Martin follows suit.]
ARCHIVIST
(with a sigh) What’s to talk about?

MARTIN
What happened back there? What you did to Sa–

[He cuts himself off.]
[A pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Go on. Say it.

MARTIN
What you did to… that thing.

ARCHIVIST
I – killed it. I – finally have the power, so I killed it.

MARTIN
Yeah, but like how? I’m – I’m sorry, I just don’t understand what actually happened.

ARCHIVIST
I – It’s hard to put into words, loo-l– (sigh) Look, can we talk about it later, we’re – (inhale) coming to a – (sigh) domain of the Buried, and I would really rather –

[A knock-knock.]
[A vague static crackles in the background, simple, all one classic tone.]
MARTIN
Did you…?

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Look down, Martin.

MARTIN
Oh.

(realizes) Wait, what?

ARCHIVIST
Don’t… get too close.

[The door creaks open.]
ARCHIVIST
Hello, Helen.

HELEN
Oh, hello! In a better mood, are we?

(lower, teasing) Feeling more secure now you’ve learned how to kill?

[As she speaks, a shimmery, high-pitched sound starts to layer over the background.]
ARCHIVIST
(inhale) Something like that.

MARTIN
Will you tell me how he did it?

ARCHIVIST
Martin…

MARTIN
He just keeps going all vague about it.

HELEN
Oh, goodness. You see what you’ve done to the poor boy, John? He’s coming to me for clear answers.

[She snorts, and it turns into her trademark laugh.]
ARCHIVIST
Shut up.

HELEN
(giggle) It’s very satisfying though, isn’t it? Teasing out vague information? You see why Elias got a kick out of it.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Shut UP!

MARTIN
John.

HELEN
You’re right – Martin. He is tetchy.

MARTIN
(overlapping) I didn’t say he was te–

HELEN
(overlapping) So, so, an explanation. From little old me.

[Pause.]
HELEN
D’you mind, John?

[The Archivist inhales, starts to say something, then cuts himself off, sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
(fine, whatever) Go right ahead.

HELEN
We’re all here, Martin. The Stranger, the Buried, the Desolation, all of us. But the Eye still rules. All this fear is being performed for its benefit.

And so, there are now exactly two roles available in this new world of ours: The Watcher, and the Watched. Subject, and object. Those who are feared, and those who are afraid.

And John, well – he is part of the Eye. A very important part. And he’s able to, shall we say, shift its focus. Turn the one into the other.

And for those of us whose very existence relies on being feared, well: to be turned into a victim destroys us utterly. And very, very painfully.

ARCHIVIST
Enough.

HELEN
Yes, I suspect so.

MARTIN
Sure. Okay, that’s – I mean, that’s really not that complicated, John; I don’t see why you were being so coy about it –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Because I’m ashamed, Martin.

[Slight pause.]
MARTIN
Ashamed?!

ARCHIVIST
Yes! Ashamed of the fact that I just – destroyed the world and have been rewarded for it, the fact that – I can walk safe through all this horror I’ve created like a… fucking tourist, destroying whoever I please. The fact that I… enjoyed it, and… the fact that there are so many others that I want to revenge myself on!

[He exhales heavily after his monologue.]
MARTIN
…No; No, I actually think you’re good on that front.

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
Yeah, I, I, I think we should go for it, get our murder on!

ARCHIVIST
(disbelief) Sorry, what?

HELEN
(surprised delight) Yes, Martin!

MARTIN
(overlapping slightly) Th, This isn’t like it was before! We’re not talking about innocent bystanders in cafes here, John; these things are – th-they’re just evil, plain and simple, and right now they’re torturing and tormenting everyone!

(pause for breath) If you want to stop them and have the power to, then – then, then yeah, let’s do it, let’s go full Kill Bill!

ARCHIVIST
I – I, I haven’t seen it.

HELEN
Oh, Martin, I am so proud of you. Can I come?

ARCHIVIST, MARTIN
(in unison) No.

HELEN
So that’s a strong “maybe” then?

[The Archivist sighs, long and heavy.]
ARCHIVIST
(under his breath) Ow.

[He lets out a small exhale of pain.]
MARTIN
John? Are you…?

ARCHIVIST
We’ve been – close for too long, I, I need, uh – You might want to take a walk.

MARTIN
Hm.

HELEN
And I’ll take that as my cue. Well, I’ll see you avenging angels later; don’t be strangers.

[She laughs, her door closes, and she’s gone.]
MARTIN
Do you need anything?

[The Archivist exhales.]
ARCHIVIST
No.

MARTIN
Fine, I’ll just –

[A sound like he’s shouldering his bag.]
MARTIN
Er, yeah, right.

[He walks a distance away. The Archivist exhales, puffing his cheeks.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Down, down, down, down, down below the earth, there was a worm. He had not always been a worm, of course, but time and tide and life had pushed him to it.

His name, he dimly recalled, was Sam, and he was, as definitely always had been the case, trapped. Boarded on all sides with no escape and no recourse.

Even in his faint and fading memories of a life that wasn’t simply stone and rancid, reeking soil, he wasn’t sure he’d ever known a thing that might be called freedom.

Choices he had had, that’s true, and certainly compared to the relentless press of all the weight and dirt now on him, the simple choice of left or right or stand or sit would now seem the most outrageous of luxuries.

But at the time, there was no joy in such decisions, for though he could point his feet left, it was a rightward turn that led him to the place where he could scrape a meager living. And while he could choose to sit, it rarely made the news any more pleasant to hear.

When had the crushing pressure in his chest become literal? When had the empty promise of the horizon finally vanished completely, replaced by the pitch darkness of this – forever wall of earth?

Sam did not know. Time had no meaning here.

There were no clocks or watches, and somewhere in his mind he was sure that the world had stopped spinning, his prison was still.

Even that single, distant point of light, so impossibly far above him that he had decided it must be the sky – even that never darkened with the recognition of night. His existence was static, and eternal. Immutable.

Sleep was only a memory, because even the prospect of unconsciousness might have made his present state slightly more bearable. Food as well must be a thing, for he could feel the hunger, but his imagination failed to picture it. The only smell he knew was the damp and the dirt.

[At this point, it becomes clear that a soft but demanding rain is falling in the background.]
But these things, grim and fearful as they were, were not unfamiliar. The aching hunger was not new, not simply a gift of the eager soil.

He had flashes of an empty belly not assuaged by hands, cracked and calloused from long, grim hours of labor. There was a shadow in his mind of sleepless nights, spent toiling, tired and shaking, desperate for some relief from the relentless pressure that crushed the life of the man that had been Sam, before he was a worm.

And a worm he surely was, for what else could spasm, crawling limbless through the ground, millimeter by millimeter, making its lonely way towards some secret destination no human could understand?

Perhaps he did still have arms or legs or the luxury of both, but down here it was impossible to tell, pressed so close together that to draw a line between a torso and a folded, bending limb was pointless.

If it moves like a worm, thinks like a worm, and screams its awful agonies towards the distant, taunting sky like a worm – well.

Conclusion is obvious.

Sam’s pale, mottled worm-flesh pressed and squeezed its way ever-forward, ever-upwards – or so he hoped. So he begged.

The light was there; it was always there. So small and far it might have been a single pinprick in a pitch-black curtain. Just enough to remind him he had eyes, starved and hollow though they were.

Just enough to remind him that there was such a thing as sky, that the endless, open air existed. Enough to kindle in him the fear that he might never see it again.

Worms don’t get to see the sky.

If he had slept, he would have dreamed of it, of flying through the light and unchained breeze, mocking the ground that he had always and forever escaped. Another good reason he was not allowed to sleep.

Sometimes, when he bent his neck and gazed longingly upwards towards the light, he could feel something looking back, its vision stretching out and down and through the opaque mud to touch him, drinking in his panic and discomfort as he tried yet again to push himself up and out.

He would call, then, desperately imploring the very thing that reveled in his suffering to end it. As he did so, he sometimes remembered dimly other pleas made in the open air to other forces keen to profit from his degradation. Forces of paper and ink and decimal points.

But such memories are brief, and gone as Sam’s lungs fill once again with sod.

His scream, though short, echoes up and through the rough-hewn tunnel, joined as it rises with the cries of a hundred others, erupting from the holes that pockmark the rotten field in a cacophony, a stomach-churning harmony of dirt-caked shrieking.

Then just as quick as it begins, it is done, and the only ones who will ever hear Sam’s screams are the ones who have entombed him.

Can he feel the warmth, from that distant spot of light, a ray of sun down there in the dark?

The poor man’s not to know the sun is gone, that what now remains is to serve no other purpose than to let this wretched world be seen.

A lifeless, hollow illumination barely worth the name of light.

But down there in the dark and icy ground, Sam still clings hard to his dream of the Sun, and the ground lets him, of course –

For what true fear can exist without hope, without the belief that things might change for the better? To tug at the knowledge that they will only get worse?

When he has the will, when the cold soil around him has been still and silent for long enough, Sam may once again begin his grim and painful climb.

Moving, squirming along by the merest fractions of a millimeter afforded by his pressing prison, he claws and digs in what might have once been fingers.

The soft earth is always keen to slip away, but sometimes – just sometimes – the tips of those extremities find purchase, and he pulls himself a little bit, such a tiny bit, upwards.

And as he twists and crawls and wrenches himself up through the hole, in spite of the excruciating slowness, disregarding the scrapes and cuts it opens up in his soft and wormly skin, Sam allows himself to dream of what might be at the top.

He has long since discarded any hope of joy, but deep down he still believes there may be a place where he does not suffer as now.

And after hours, days, impossible to measure weeks, maybe he has moved a meter. Even more perhaps, and however bruised and broken his body may now be, he is closer to the sky, and nobody can take that away from him.

Until the rains begin to fall.

The rains fall here as they do so many places in this new world. Thick and oily drops that taste of bitter salt, torrential tears plummeting from the watching sky, thumping and squelching onto the thirsty soil in which the worms writhe painfully towards a surface that does not want them.

The ground softens. Shifts. And starts to slip and flow into a torrent of black mud.

Deep below, Sam feels rain begin to drip upon his forehead, and he knows exactly what it means.

He wants to scream again but he is so tired by his ascent that the only sound he can produce is a low, defeated wail. And as has happened so many times before in his poor, defeated life, he feels the walls begin to shift and soften, as the slippery flood pushes him down, down, down.

Deeper, perhaps, than he has ever been before, so deep the light is almost gone, but never is the darkness fully complete.

There must always be a distant promise of escape.

Sometimes, when his despair is at his peak, and the sky is only there to mock him, Sam changes his direction. He has breathed the mud so long he has no thought of suffocation, and he pushes his face into the walls of his tunnel and starts to try and dig across.

He is afraid of what he might find beyond the limits of his own constricted tunnel, but between the fear and the despair he makes his choice and digs.

For days or weeks he squirms and struggles through the hard-packed soil, mind dwelling on a pinprick spot of light that he might never see again.

What has he done? Abandoning the route that has been carved for his emergence. The panic begins to set in, and he shudders and weeps slick, muddy tears of his own.

But then one day, Sam pushes forward and feels his face break through a wall. The earth parts and he finds himself in a tiny sliver of open air.

A room. A cavern. A way out.

It is only as he slides inside so neatly that he realizes what it is: Another tunnel. For another worm.

As he falls deeper into it, he finds himself staring at the pale and hairless face of its inhabitant.

Poor Sam has no way to know his neighbor’s name is Richard, that he once struggled in a  life as hard and desperate as his own. That his dreams of the light and painful screaming climb towards it is just as keen and grueling.

All that matters is that this new worm is facing up. And Sam, because of how he entered the tunnel, is facing down.

How do you fight, when you cannot move beyond the slowest inching crawl, without limbs or weapons or the kinetic force of violence?

You do it slowly, pressing, biting, tearing gradually through each other until at the very end, one of you is still.

There is no light, for Sam is faced away from it, blocking it from his opponent. But even were it bathed in stark illumination, no one could have said for sure where the sticky mud ended and the ragged, bloody faces began.

A cloying mass of teeth and tears and torn skin as two terrified victims slowly chew through each other over a distant hope that neither would ever be allowed to achieve.

When it is done, Richard is dead, or quiet enough that it makes no difference, and the tunnel belongs to Sam. It is identical to the one he has left, in all ways other than that he had to do an awful thing to get it. And still he faces downwards.

He rests there for days, with nothing to keep him company but the remains of his opponent, quietly moldering, until at last he begins the gruesome task of turning around.

The contortions that he undergoes, the bending and the breaking that he subjects his pale wormish body to, is a greater pain than any he thought possible, and the snap and pop of bone and sinew echoes to the surface far above.

But at last Sam has his victory: he has claimed another tunnel, and he can see the light.

Perhaps this one will be better, will let him squirm up higher.

But underneath is still that lurking fear that maybe, it is worse.

[The rain starts falling faster, higher.]
The truth is plain enough, though, even as he fights so hard not to know it:

There is no difference, and as the rains begin to fall once again, he knows the world will never let him escape the depths to which he has fallen.

Better to keep him buried, neatly away.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
God, I hate the Buried.

[He breathes a bit shakily for a few moments.]
ARCHIVIST
End recording.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE UK, NEAR A DIVISION OF THE BURIED, A BIT WAYS OFF FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The rain is still pouring full-blast. The wind blows unyieldingly.]
[We hear some howling in the background, all part of the Buried’s soundscape.]
MARTIN
Kinda wish the apocalypse had some magazines.

A-Actually no, second thoughts, probably not. Ooh. Def, definitely not.

[We hear jostling of his bag.]
MARTIN
(sigh) Come on, John. How long does it take to describe – scary mud?

[Multiple things howl. Martin’s breath hitches.]
MARTIN
(don’t kill me!) Oh – oh, o,okay, okay, okay – sorry, sorry! Sorry.

[The howling subsides.]
[The rain backs off, too, ever-so-slightly, enough to hear a faint buzzing sound.]
MARTIN
(under his breath) Oh, god –

(normal) What now?

[He takes a step towards the noise, which continues to buzz on regular intervals.]
MARTIN
What, seriously? A spade?

[The buzzing continues over his words.]
MARTIN
Isn’t that like kind of, I don’t know, insensitive? Given where you are?

[He sighs.]
MARTIN
Fine, fine – fine.

[He sighs, picks the spade up with a scraping metal sound. Starts to dig. Almost immediately, we hear the sound of the old Nokia ringtone.]
[The shovel continues to make metallic scraping noises as Martin digs out more earth, and the ringing continues to get louder.]
MARTIN
(ugh, of course this would happen) For god’s sake.

[He keeps digging, the phone gets louder. Then he picks it up, accepts the call with a little low boop.]
MARTIN
Hello?

ANNABELLE CANE
Hello. Is that Martin?

MARTIN
Don’t do that.

ANNABELLE
What, no stomach for games?

MARTIN
Well, your games aren’t exactly fun for everyone, are they?

ANNABELLE
(audible smirk) Very few games are.

MARTIN
L-Look, look, look, I’m talking to Annabelle Cane, right?

ANNABELLE
You never gave me your name, so why should I offer mine?

MARTIN
Just – what do you want?

ANNABELLE
I want to help you, of course.

[Short pause.]
MARTIN
No. Thank you.

ANNABELLE
It’s a hard place to find yourself in. Maybe I can be of some – assistance!

MARTIN
You can assist me by giving me the – creepy-phone-thing a rest!

ANNABELLE
He’s more powerful here than he’s ever been, isn’t he?

And you’re not sure what that means for you.

[The briefest of pauses. Martin inhales shakily.]
MARTIN
I’m hanging up now.

ANNABELLE
Does he even need you at all?

MARTIN
Bye!

[He hangs up with another boop.]
[He sighs. The previously-howling things in the Buried – likely the worms far below – howl again, insistently.]
MARTIN
I know, right?

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE UK]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Footsteps in the gravelly road, walking in a comfortable silence. Then:]
ARCHIVIST
Help us with what?

MARTIN
Excuse me?

[It becomes clear that the Archivist’s static is present.]
ARCHIVIST
Annabelle, help us with… what, our, our, our journey, killing Elias, vanishing the Entities – what?

MARTIN
Please don’t do that.

ARCHIVIST
Do what? (realizes) Oh. Oh, right, I, I see, yes. Well, I – Sorry.

MARTIN
It doesn’t – feel great, having someone look inside your head.

ARCHIVIST
You can – feel it?

[Martin exhales, a small puff of a thing.]
MARTIN
No, but that’s hardly the point, John –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Oh, no, I see, sorry, um, right.

MARTIN
I mean, I don’t want to keep secrets from you, but –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) You should at least – be able to.

MARTIN
Basically, yeah!

ARCHIVIST
I-I suppose that’s fair.

MARTIN
It’s just – it’s weird knowing that you can know literally everything I think and feel. E-Especially since you’re not exactly the most open of people – emotionally, I mean.

ARCHIVIST
What – That’s not fair; I share!

MARTIN
Sure you do.

ARCHIVIST
I do.

MARTIN
Okay, so how exactly would you describe your current emotional state regarding all of this?

ARCHIVIST
I –

MARTIN
(overlapping) Go on, I’m all ears.

ARCHIVIST
I feel…

MARTIN
(go on) Mhm.

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) I feel… sad.

[Brief pause.]
MARTIN
(flat) Sad.

ARCHIVIST
Very sad.

MARTIN
(*very* flat) Very sad.

[He sighs slightly as he says it. Their bags jangle.]
ARCHIVIST
Yes, alright; point taken.

MARTIN
You said you could control it now.

ARCHIVIST
I can, I, I just – it – You’re absolutely right. I will refrain from Knowing anything about you.

MARTIN
Thank you.

ARCHIVIST
Unless you’re in danger.

MARTIN
(with a laugh) Physical danger; If I’m in danger of being mad at you or something –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) I –

[He sighs.]
MARTIN
(continuing over him) – you’ve got to figure it out the old-fashioned way.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. Agreed.

[A sigh.]
[Then:]
ARCHIVIST
So. What did Annabelle say?

MARTIN
(exhale) She offered to help, but she didn’t say what with; she… asked us where we were going; I didn’t tell her, but… it was pretty obvious she had a good idea?

ARCHIVIST
Did you… feel like she was influencing your mind at all?

MARTIN
I don’t think so, but I mean… who knows?

ARCHIVIST
I could.

MARTIN
(increasingly forceful) But look. She didn’t control me into asking you not to look into my head, if that’s what you’re thinking. That’s all me –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Martin, I’m not looking for a – loophole.

MARTIN
Well, good, ‘cause this isn’t one.

[Brief pause.]
ARCHIVIST
(teasing) Methinks the Spider dost protest too much.

[Martin stops walking.]
MARTIN
John –

ARCHIVIST
(jeez) Joking! Just joking.

[They start walking again.]
MARTIN
(with a sigh) Do you know where she was calling from?

ARCHIVIST
No. She – No. She’s still – hidden, somewhere; I, I can see her voice coming down the phone line, but the closer it gets to her the harder it is to see.

Mm, Christ, this all feels so – (inhale) obtuse; it’s like, I have the power to drink the whole ocean, but I have to do it through a straw.

[He sighs.]
[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
Just – I don’t know, it – it worries me, I guess? You know, when you do the whole – (imitation of the Archivist’s ‘Statement Voice’) – curse this flesh prison – (normal) – thing, it –

I get you’re different; none of us are what we were, but, well? It worries me.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

MARTIN
That’s not – It’s okay.

[The Archivist sighs.]
MARTIN
(brighter) Anyway, my flesh prison – (small laugh) – would like to stop for a bit. How far until the next… domain?

ARCHIVIST
A while. If you want to stop, it’s as good a place as any.

MARTIN
(with a sigh) No, I just – need a moment. One where I’m not just relentlessly pushing forward.

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping, large sigh) Alright, we can stop.

[They stop walking. We hear a bit of jingling as they presumably set down their bags and sit down.]
[They sit in silence for a bit.]
[Then:]
[Martin sighs.]
MARTIN
Why did it have to be us?

ARCHIVIST
You’d rather be a bystander?

[Clothing sounds as he shifts.]
ARCHIVIST
Trapped in one of those places?

MARTIN
I don’t know. No.. I just – (exhale) I bet Gertrude would be able to do this, you know? She – She would eat a hellscape like this for breakfast.

[Slight pause.]
ARCHIVIST
I – don’t think she would have done very well here.

MARTIN
No?

ARCHIVIST
No.

[More sounds of movement.]
MARTIN
Do you… Know that?

[A brief pause. The Archivist’s static starts up. He takes a shaky breath.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
To say that Gertrude Robinson never had a friend would not be true. She was close in her way to many people, but looking back I wonder if she ever realized just how strongly she herself reeked of the Lonely.

When she first joined the Archives, she took the place of a man named Angus Stacey, whose face was torn from his skull by a creature of masks and smiles.

Gertrude had thought of as ‘The Grinning Wheel,’ and it was one of the first things to fall at the hands of the Institute’s new avenger. Appropriately enough, Gertrude used fire.

She had some small knowledge of the truth of things when she first took the position, enough knowledge to be dangerous, as the old saying goes, but also enough to be cautious, and it was leaning into this second inclination that kept her alive through those first few years.

Angus Stacey had, in the long tradition of Institute Archivists, been a disappointment to the man whose eyes then sat in the smirking face of one Director Richard Mendelson.

Angus had been too keen to learn, too ambitious in his academic legacy. He had had grand plans to revise Smirke’s Fourteen, and, in doing so, burned through his resources, his luck, and ultimately all but one of his assistants.

When Gertrude was appointed to the role, there was a single survivor left in the Archives: A woman by the name of Fiona Law.

Fiona was the most fascinating combination of curiosity and cowardice, pushing forward and forward into the unknown until the very first moment of threat crystallized, and then she was away.

Of course, retreat is not always possible in such a line of business, and when that proved to be the case, there was a single trait which Fiona possessed that saw her surviving encounters which had killed far braver souls than her:

Because when she was pushed to the very limits of her terror, Fiona Law would faint. And while there are those things in the dark that would kill you as you slept, most get no real delight from it, unless you are awake enough to know what is happening.

And so, through cowardice and unconsciousness, Fiona had survived an entire generation of Archivist. And even stranger, when Angus Stacey died and she had the chance to walk away, she decided to remain.

She had never got deep enough into the mysteries that plagued her to slake that burning curiosity. And she never would.

Alongside this inherited survivor, Gertrude would add two more assistants: Eric Delano and Emma Harvey. They were young, like her, keen to delve deeper into those strange secrets that back then were spoken of more openly.

To them, Fiona seemed something of a joke, a middle-aged chatterbox who told stories of the Blitz and jumped at the long shadows in the corners of the Archives.

Emma in particular was Gertrude’s confidant, the one whose knowledge and instincts she trusted, and the only member of the Institute who ever knew of the strange bond between Gertrude and Agnes Montague.

But Emma had a sickness. As much as she might have despised the aging Fiona, it was the same one that plagued her: Curiosity. That desperate, grasping need to know.

Emma, however, was circumspect enough to recognize the danger of such inclinations in a place like the Archives, and after those initial few years, settled on a question.

The first question to which she would apply her methods of… experimentation: Why wasn’t Fiona dead yet?

The experiments were simple enough. When a statement was close enough and real enough that finding its source seemed a possibility, Emma would volunteer herself and Fiona to investigate it.

Eric had always been a homebody, and had no problem being left out of such expeditions, while Gertrude had far better things to do than worry about the comings and going of her assistants, and so let her trusted Emma arrange things as she pleased.

Once out near danger, Fiona would always find herself ever-so-slightly ahead, always seeming to be inexplicably the first through the door. And more often than not it would close behind her. By the end, the poor woman genuinely believed spontaneously locking doors were a tell-tale sign of the supernatural.

Emma would do her best to observe from safety, making notes, only retrieving the often unconscious Fiona when the danger passed. She watched as her poor guinea pig stumbled through a maze of whispering grubs. She timed the intervals at which Fiona emerged from a hungry fog, and recorded her barely escaping the Sandman who came to take her eyes.

Poor Fiona never suspected a thing. Decades this went on, until Fiona was old and tired. There was less chaos back then. Gertrude’s war was still only kindling, and years might go by without anything terrible brushing against the Institute. But at last, they found a coffin. And it was not a place that could be escaped by fleeing or by fainting.

When Emma came to tell Gertrude what had happened, she found the first of the cobwebs in her hair, the ones she would wash from it every morning for the rest of her life. And Gertrude mourned the first of many losses, and did not suspect the truth.

Eventually, Fiona was replaced by a young man named Michael. Far too young to have such a job, really, but – things were different in those days. He was keen and eager, and Emma had a – slightly different idea of how to test him.

She never really touched Eric, of course. He had been marked early by another who Emma was… keen not to cross.

But young Michael? So innocent, so naive? She decided to experiment with how long she could keep him in the dark as to what was really going on.

As it turns out: All his life.

This time, Gertrude did have an inkling as to what was happening, but had her own escalating conflicts to concern herself with, and recognized the potential in a truly ignorant assistant.

At some point Eric disappeared. It’s interesting the places that Gertrude did and did not think to look for him. She scoured the most warped and darkened corners of London, expecting any moment to find his remains. But she took Mary at her word when she said she hadn’t seen him.

She could have Known the truth, of course, if she had wished, but it was so much easier to make it another pillar of her crusade. Emma knew what had happened, but had no interest in sharing such details.

Eric was replaced by another assistant, not so young as Michael, and hardened with some encounters of her own. She was eager to prove herself, and exactly the sort of person to intrigue the aging Emma.

There was… a fire to Sarah Carpenter, perhaps the one which led to Gertrude hiring her, and Emma’s curiosity ignited once again, this time keen to find out exactly what it would take to break this brave investigator of the unknown.

By this point Gertrude was fully lost to her plots and plans and struggles, and as long as her assistants played their parts when asked, she paid them no more mind. And the frequency of genuine encounters grew as the season of hurried rituals came nearer.

It wasn’t hard for Emma to convince her younger colleague to take the lead in their inquiries. She took Sarah to a cave and sent her deep inside to see how far it went. There was no end, and the darkness was deeper than an absence of light would allow, but Sarah held firm to her cable, and Emma was gracious enough to pull her back into the light.

She took Sarah to the woods with a strange book of astronomy and suggested she go and chart the stars. The brave stargazer stayed beneath the canopy, never quite lost herself to the cosmos, though sometimes when Emma looked into her eyes she could still see a reflection of uncanny constellations.

She even convinced Sarah to stay inside an old man’s house, desperate to see her eaten by a hungry door, but was again disappointed.

And all through it Gertrude could not see what was happening. And certainly the Spider smoothed things, elided questions, wiped away evidence, but it barely had to. Far better to feed Gertrude a steady string of plans to foil and rituals to derail.

Sarah’s luck ran out when Gertrude and Michael were away on a last trip to that frozen island that did not exist. Emma had been given the statement of a widow whose life and home and partner had been taken by a man who, as she put it, “burned on the inside.” And so Sarah and her secret tormentor went looking for this being, and they found him standing in the smoking ruin of an old farmhouse.

He was bald, dressed in dreary office clothes. To a cursory examination, unfit and unremarkable, save for his peculiar surroundings. If they had paused and looked closer, Emma might have seen the drizzling rain rising as steam from his skin. Sarah may have noticed the thin lines in his flesh from whence spilled a dull orange glow.

But they didn’t. And as was her custom, Emma allowed her old knees to betray her, falling behind her companion.

Sarah Carpenter’s last words were “Hello? I’m from –”

And then it was over. He split open like a flower bud blooming, and inside there was only the most terrifying heat. She had no time to run, and by the time she thought to scream it was too late as the thing enveloped her, closing tight, until she was simply more ash, trapped forever inside that charred and hollow shell.

Emma knew as she ran that she might have gone too far.

When Gertrude returned with no Michael to a silent Archive and only Emma’s stammered lies to fill it, she finally started to suspect the truth. She wondered briefly if it was hypocrisy, to feel such anger at what Emma Harvey had done, when she now had blood aplenty on her hands, including Michael’s.

But it didn’t matter. The rage she felt was ice-cold. And so Gertrude went to the one person she was certain she could trust on the matter.

Agnes Montague and Gertrude Robinson only ever met once in their lives. Even if the Lightless Flame had allowed it, what would there have been to say? The bond between them, real as it was, was no one’s choice but the Web’s, and neither of them was keen to play its game any further than they had to.

Their discussion was brief, and tinged with a melancholy, an awareness of mistakes, of their choices and duties and destinies. Neither of them smiled. But Agnes did confirm what Gertrude knew, and the details of Sarah’s suffering only sharpened that deep and wounded hatred.

It was a trivial matter to convince the man who now watched from the skull of Elias Bouchard to allow it, so long as the deed did not take place within the Archives itself.

But it didn’t need to. An employee’s home address is a simple thing to acquire.

When Emma Harvey awoke to the searing heat, she knew she was already dead. As the fire took her, and left her flesh running off her bones like oil, all she willed was not to give it the satisfaction of being afraid.

I wonder if it would have upset Gertrude to learn that, even at the end, Emma had no idea it was her that had arranged it. Maybe not. For all her anger, there was no thirst for revenge in the Archivist, only an eagerness to expunge an infection that had gone unnoticed for too long.

And with that, Gertrude Robinson was without assistants.

She never hired another. She worked with those that seemed useful until they were no longer so – Leitner. Dekker. Keay. Even Salesa on occasion. But she never again allowed herself to trust.

[Pause. Then:]
[The Archivist inhales.]
ARCHIVIST
I, I, I’m sorry; I – I didn’t, um –

MARTIN
Oh, no, it’s, uh – it’s okay. (cough) I just – I couldn’t – not listen, or interrupt. Or –

ARCHIVIST
I, I, I promise, I didn’t know I was going to do that.

MARTIN
I, I understand. (brief pause, exhale) Well, let’s… (sigh) try to avoid that next time.

[He ends this with a little laugh.]
ARCHIVIST
Yes, quite.

[He sighs.]
[Some movement, an exhale of air through puffed cheeks, and then:]
MARTIN
So. What? Without assistants she’d be bad at the apocalypse?

[More movement.]
ARCHIVIST
W-Without trust. W-Without a reason.

Gertrude needed both the purpose her mission gave her and the control her position allowed. To be here, like us, without a – a reason, without someone to ground her? She – She’d have power, but – no control. No real purpose.

Perhaps she’d have dedicated herself to a d,doomed quest like us but – (quieter, contemplative) No. I think this would have broken her. And she’d have resigned herself to – ruling her domain.

MARTIN
What domain?

[Movement.]
ARCHIVIST
We all have domain here, Martin. The place that feeds us.

MARTIN
Oh. (brief pause) Where’s yours?

ARCHIVIST
(laugh) I mean we’re – traveling towards it.

MARTIN
Oh. Right, obviously. Duh. Uh, what about me?

ARCHIVIST
(cautiously) Would you… like me to –

MARTIN
(overlapping, sharp) No, no. Don’t tell me.

I don’t want to know.

ARCHIVIST
Okay.

[Martin inhales, then lets out a little hm.]
MARTIN
(coy) So. If you say Gertrude wouldn’t have been able to go on without a reason –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping, audible fond eyeroll) Yes, Martin, you are my reason.

MARTIN
Just wanted to make you say it!

[A beat wherein the Archivist inhales.]
MARTIN
Cool.

ARCHIVIST
Right. (exhale) Should we press on?

[He starts to get the bags together.]
MARTIN
No – uh – just, uh – before we do.

ARCHIVIST
Mhm?

MARTIN
A moment ago, when you were talking.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

MARTIN
The old Archivist, Angus.

[The Archivist inhales, a bit sharply.]
MARTIN
You said Fiona was… released when he died.

[The Archivist exhales over his words.]
ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
If you had died,

[The Archivist inhales again.]
MARTIN
– would the others have been able to quit?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. (pause) I didn’t know.

MARTIN
If you had, would you have told them? Would that have, have changed what happened?

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) I don’t know, Martin. I-I don’t know.

[The bags get reshouldered. They start walking.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE UK]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The Archivist releases a long sigh as he and Martin walk. The footsteps, as are now typical, are crunchy.]
[The environment here is deceptively quiet, but for the constant running of whispers in the background. They overlap so fully it almost feels like listening to running water if not listening closely.]
ARCHIVIST
O-kay! Time you went for a walk.

MARTIN
Y-Yeah, about that… (small exhale) You’re sure you’ll be okay on your own?

ARCHIVIST
(small exhale, almost an um) I always have been.

MARTIN
Okay. I mean – Well, I don’t like this place.

ARCHIVIST
Once again, Martin, that’s – sort of the point!

[They both let out a small laugh.]
MARTIN
Yeah, yeah – I know, alright; I get it; it’s just – it’s more than that. This place, what did you call it, the – (he fumbles for the name) The Rotten Core?

ARCHIVIST
The Corpse Routes.

MARTIN
Yeah, yeah, that. Well, it – it feels – (sigh) I don’t know, like it’s –

ARCHIVIST
Waiting.

MARTIN
Yeah! Waiting.

[Something creaks in the background over their words.]
[Long pause.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
This is the one with the, um, death guy, isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
This is Oliver Banks’ domain, yes.

[Slight pause.]
MARTIN
So it’s him that’s waiting.

ARCHIVIST
Not just him, but – (exhale) yes.

MARTIN
So, are you gonna smite him, then?

ARCHIVIST
(pause) …Um…

MARTIN
John?

[The Archivist sighs softly, but gives no response.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
John, I said are you going to s–

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) I heard you the first time.

MARTIN
And?…

ARCHIVIST
I-I don’t know.

MARTIN
Why not? Can’t you just do what you did what that Sasha-thing, make the Eye See him and all that?

ARCHIVIST
I… could, I think.

MARTIN
…Cool, so what’s the problem, then? Take another monster off the hit list; job done.

ARCHIVIST
…It’s not. That simple?

MARTIN
Well, what does that mean. (slight pause, insistent) What does that mean, John? What, what happened to Kill Bill? (barest of pauses) John? John, you said –

ARCHIVIST
I know what I said, and I don’t – (sigh) I don’t know, Martin. I just – I don’t think he’s – (sigh) I don’t know; I don’t think he’s evil.

[Something creaks.]
MARTIN
(really?) Oh, yeah, sure; he’s probably a really kind, benevolent ruler of a hellish fear prison.

ARCHIVIST
It’s just – he helped me. Wh, When I was – (short pause) He woke me up.

MARTIN
(flat, flat, so flat) Wow. What a hero.

ARCHIVIST
Martin?

MARTIN
(immediately) What. (beat, the Archivist makes an amused sound) What. (beat, off the Archivist) Yeah, alright; I know; I’m sorry.

[There’s the sound of some movement over his words.]
ARCHIVIST
(audibly amused) …Is there something you want to talk about?

[He doesn’t quite manage to hold back his laugh as he finishes speaking.]
MARTIN
No, I’m – fine; it’s fine; everything’s fine! I’m sorry.

[Slight pause.]
ARCHIVIST
(cat’s got the cream) Martin…

MARTIN
(too quick) I said it’s fine.

ARCHIVIST
(still so audibly smug) Are you jealous?

MARTIN
I told you not to Know things about me!

ARCHIVIST
(laughing) I really didn’t have to.

MARTIN
(uh) I – Y-You – Good. ‘Cause I’m definitely not.

ARCHIVIST
(very amused) Alright!

MARTIN
Look, I’m fine, alright?

ARCHIVIST
(oh, so amused) You said.

MARTIN
(too defensive) Yes, I did! And e– and even if I was jealous, I would be perfectly justified anyway, so!

ARCHIVIST
(absolutely grinning) But you’re not.

MARTIN
No! I’m fine.

ARCHIVIST
Alright!

MARTIN
(so there!) Good!

ARCHIVIST
(matching tone) Good!

MARTIN
(end of conversation) Great.

[Long pause.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Alright, fine, yes, yes, I am jealous, alright? Yes, if you absolutely must know.

ARCHIVIST
Because… he woke me up.

[Martin makes a couple of sounds of disbelief.]
MARTIN
I was there weeks, and nothing. He talks to you for five minutes and suddenly you’re back on your feet, and – bouncing around like a, like a spring chicken!

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping, laughing) I mean, that’s really not –

MARTIN
(overlapping) I mean, what’s so special about him, that you wake up for him and not me, hm? Enlighten me.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, that’s – that’s not really how it worked. It – It wasn’t –

[He stops, reformulates his next words.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Look. Martin, I’m sorry you feel that way, but I’m not going to kill a man just because you’re jealous.

MARTIN
Why not?!

[Pause.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
(deflating) Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

[He lets out a small sigh.]
[Another pause. Then:]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Please?

[The Archivist snickers.]
ARCHIVIST
Who knows. Maybe he’ll try to stop us getting through the routes, and I’ll have to.

MARTIN
Mm.

ARCHIVIST
But I’m not going to – seek him out. At the very least he’s earned not having me hunt him down.

MARTIN
Fine. I suppose that’s – reasonable.

ARCHIVIST
Now, if you’re – quite done inciting me to murder?

MARTIN
Not murder! Smiting.

[The Archivist sighs heavily.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Right, yes, yes, of course. You – (long inhale) You vomit your horrors.

[The Archivist makes a very disgusted sound.]
ARCHIVIST
(with a laugh) Oh – I’m not sure I like that metaphor.

MARTIN
Puke your terrors?

ARCHIVIST
…Just go.

MARTIN
Alright! Alright, I’m going.

[We hear him pick up his bag and walk off a ways.]
[The Archivist laughs fondly after him; you can practically hear him shaking his head. He follows it up with a heavy exhale.]
[And then: just the whispers of the Corpse Routes.]
[And then:]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Report to prevent future deaths. This report is being sent to:

(voice changes, softens; it’s almost his normal voice) The Great Eye that watches all who linger in terror and gorges itself on the sufferings of those under its unrelenting, stuporous gaze. And its Archive, which draws knowledge of this suffering unto itself.

(statement voice, which here is lower and more brusque) One: Coroner.

I am Oliver Banks, sometimes known as Antonio Blake or Dr Thomas Pritchard. I serve The Coming End That Waits For All And Will Not Be Ignored.

Two: Coroner’s legal powers.

I make this report under no authority, no regulation or act of law save the hollow power and grim responsibility given me by the Termination of All Life. With it, I may see and spread the hidden veins of destiny that wrap us close and draw us through the empty, yearning parody of meaning that we call life, knowing at all stages that the last and final point of this journey is a blank and futile end.

I have no power to stop it, and even if I did, I would not do so. For to rob a soul of death is as torturous as its inevitable coming.

Three: Investigation and inquest.

On the first and last day of the age of the Beholding, I begin my vigil into the doom of Danika Gelsthorpe.

She was, at the time of the change, thirty-four years of age, and found herself within my domain, traveling slowly and unremittingly along the length of the stretching Corpse Routes.

She is one of many thousands, neither remarkable nor unique in her background or destination. She has spent the last twenty of those years acutely aware and in constant dread of a death she believed to be imminent.

The earliest she can remember being certain she was about to die was when, at the age of fifteen due to a chronic case of acid reflux, she decided that she had a malignant intestinal tumor. She would spend whole nights lying awake, imagining it there, growing. Spreading. Blocking her organs and preparing to kill her.

Danika knew the whole thing was ridiculous, of course, and did not visit a doctor about it, simply assuming it would be discovered when she finally collapsed. She diagnosed herself with a year to live, at most.

At the age of sixteen, she contracted a case of acute gastroenteritis which knotted her guts so severely that she had to have several scans taken by a buzzing hospital machine. Young Danika lay there on the hospital bed, waiting for the stern-faced doctor to come in and tell her what she already knew: that she had months, at most, to live.

When they said no such thing, talking about her treatment for her decidedly non-fatal condition, an incredible sense of joy began to overtake her. A deep and profound relief. There was nothing there. She wasn’t going to die! She was going to have a life.

At least, for the next three months, which was how long it took her to find a lump in her chest that she decided was fatal breast cancer. This one, she did get checked out, and was told in no uncertain terms that it was a harmless cyst.

But she knew they’d missed something. Clearly the cyst had distracted them, causing them to miss the actual tumor. But she couldn’t go back. No doubt she’d be dead within a year. Two, at most.

And so it continued for the next two decades of her life. She started smoking at the age of seventeen, battling with the addiction her whole life, and not once was there a chesty cough that she did not decide was lung cancer.

When she had her first panic attack at age twenty-three, she was absolutely certain that she was having a stroke. Every dizzy spell was a sign of MS; every achy leg was a fatal blood clot.

She never feared an epidemic or a plague, and the thought of infection rarely troubled her, because she knew that whatever was about to imminently kill her was going to rise up from deep inside her own body.

For her whole life, as each milestone of adulthood passed, Danika never believed that she would live more than two years further.

Every relationship was tinged with a melancholic guilt that she would leave them so soon. Every achievement overshadowed by the certainty she wouldn’t be around to enjoy it for very much longer.

Real problems – her acid reflux, her blood pressure – were ignored, because – well. They wouldn’t matter for much longer, would they?

When the change came and the fears oozed forth into our world, the End that laces through every fiber of my soul reached out and gave Danika to me. She had fed it well for so long; it was only right that she should be here.

Four: Circumstances of the death.

In exactly thirteen stretches of the route on which Danika travels – a stretch being measured in the waves of nauseating terror that flow out of her with such rhythmic regularity – she will finally arrive at her destination.

It will be a crowded place, a shopping mall or somewhere similar, though her feet will never leave the route that binds her. She will fear it first as a dull ache, a sensation not unlike being pinched, but on the inside of her leg. Her skin will prickle like a faint and shuddering electric current were passing through it, and she will absentmindedly scratch at it as though it were a simple itch that could be dismissed.

She will know exactly what is happening, but after so many scares and false alarms and dismal, morbid obsessions, she will not feel comfortable enough to sound any alarm or ask for anyone’s help.

She will simply stagger over to a bench that is nearby and find herself a seat to try and wait out whatever unpleasant sensation’s washing over her, even though she is certain it will never leave her.

It is, alas, the act of sitting down that dislodges the long-foreseen blood clot in her leg, formed when she took that long-distance coach trip. She should have known with her dreadful circulation that cramming herself into so little leg room would be the end of her, but she had dismissed such thoughts, waving them away as more paranoia.

But the End knows there is no paranoia about your own demise. Only that dim, plodding awareness of its constant approach.

The clot, now broken, will travel up and through her. Danika will feel its passage all through her body, aware of it as every vein of the Corpse Route is aware of her and those just like her, walking along their all-too-brief span.

She will begin to cough as it hits her lungs, her anxious dread and sense of doom bubbling up to fever pitch as the pink mucus bubbles up through her lips.

She clutches her chest, as if desperate to pull the knotted blood vessels out with her bare hands, and looks wildly about. But the crowds that were there such a short time ago have vanished, and there is nobody to help her. Nobody to see her collapse and call an ambulance. It is too late. It has always been too late.

Danika Gelsthorpe will try one last time to stand, and instead collapse into a corner, mostly obscured by a large pot plant, and will not be discovered for at least half an hour, by which point any hope of saving her has long since passed.

She remains conscious for several minutes after she falls, unable to move or speak or even think in any recognizable sense, but aware enough of what is happening to be grasped with the despair of a terror realized.

And then, at last, she dies. Her last thoughts are certainty of the yawning well of nothingness that awaits her as consciousness slips away.

Danika takes another step along the Corpse Route.

Five: Coroner’s concerns.

I watch, as with each motion, each laboured, reluctant movement along her path, Danika Gelsthorpe is painfully and inescapably aware of what it is that lies at the end of it. She tries to move backwards, off to the side, any direction other than that unstoppable, inescapable forwards. But her limbs seize up with the attempt.

She tries to stay still, but can do so only with the most incredible of efforts. To eke out another few seconds of stasis sets every nerve in her body aflame with agony and effort, begging her to scream despite her jaw being set in a frozen rictus of somber morning.

I see her relive the coming moment of her inevitable demise. Every inch along the route she moves, she sees another flash of what is to come, the sickening knowledge of where she is going, the sensation of traveling there, through the movements of her own body, as much as those movements may be made under her own duress.

No amount of protest or effort can travel any other way but towards the end.

Sometimes, for some small variety, I will allow Danika to brush against another route. The final fate of someone she loves.

She may see Maria lying in her hospital bed, monitors crowding her as the doctors struggle to get an IV into her wildly convulsing arm. She might have a flash of Bobby, fingers tightening around the rungs of the ladder as the rusted nails give way.

She often sees Dennis’s face as the knife slips eagerly between his ribs, even though he doesn’t die for hours afterwards. And with each one she knows her steps forward bring closer not only her own end, but also all of theirs.

Time walks forward with her but she has not the strength to stop it.

Her fate draws ever-nearer, filling me with the joy of watchful fear, but also my own concerns.

The matters of concern are as follows:

a) When Danika Gelsthorpe reaches the end of her Corpse Route, she will die. This new world of fear reviles death as a release, but the Coming End cannot exist without its reality.

It is not a being of dangled promises and shifting torments. The certainty of death waits for all who travel the Corpse Routes, and that certainty will be delivered on, without hesitation or consideration of any other factors.

b) This place is a limit on the fear that can be generated from them, as their pool is necessarily finite and ultimately, however slowly, it will be exhausted.

To be offset, this consideration will require the acquisition of victims from other domains as replacements, potentially inciting… bad feeling between those domains.

c) A metaphysical quirk of this new reality’s divorce from the traditional concept of time, and – one for which I have no further explanation, means that I do not believe new humans are being created or born.

The souls trapped within this transformed world are the only ones who will ever be here, and the presence of the Termination of All requires that – ultimately, that is what will happen.

However slowly, the domains of death will be removing sufferers from a closed system. However many thousands of years may be experienced in time, eventually this world will be left barren and empty.

d) When this happens, the Great Powers themselves will also fade and die, withering away into nothingness and releasing this reality from their grip.

I… do not know how I feel about this.

Six: Actions that should be taken.

None. Even if such a fate could be avoided, as it comes closer and the other Entities grow in their awareness of their own end, the grotesque ripples of their own impossible panic shall glut and feed my master, gorging it to the point where – perhaps it will even surpass the Watcher in prominence.

The others may take what actions they wish; they may plot and plan and tear themselves apart in an attempt to separate from the fate that they know they cannot escape, but they will fail. The currents of perception and reality may twist in whatever shapes they want, but none of them can ever render things truly eternal.

And I shall help, ushering on this final, blank emptiness. Perhaps once it might have horrified me, or given me some sense of pursuing the ultimate release of the world that you have damned.

But I am too much of my Patron now, and my feelings cannot help but reflect the shadows of… anticipation that lurk within the grave. The End does not fear its own cessation, for it is the certainty and promise of all life, however strange, that it will one day finish, and that includes its own stark existence.

It shall be the last, and when the universe is silent and still forever, it shall, perhaps, in that impossible moment before it vanishes, finally be satisfied.

Seven: Your response.

Please, John, do not interpret this report as a plea for mercy or a call to action. I would have offered it willingly, of course, but to do so is no longer an option.

You cannot ask. You may only take. And so the scope of my domain is yours. Enter it and destroy me, if you wish.

I fear the annihilation you would gift me –

[Creeeeak.]
– as little as I desire it.

I am now, as the thing I feed, a fixed point, that has neither the longing nor the ability to change its state of existence.

I can do nothing to you, and you may walk the Corpse Routes in safety should you choose, though if you wish to confront me, you will have to seek me out.

You know, of course, where I am. But know that – even you, with all your power, cannot keep the world alive forever.

All things end, and every step you take, whatever direction you may choose, only brings you closer to it.

[Creeeak.]
Report ends.

[The Archivist exhales heavily.]
ARCHIVIST
Lot to think about. I – I feel… No. I don’t want to destroy Oliver Banks. It wouldn’t do any good. I know that, and he never asked for this any more than I did.

I feel badly for those who exist in his domain, o-of course, I do, but – (shaky inhale) At least their suffering will be over. Eventually.

I can’t destroy everyone I cross paths with, it – (shaky inhale/exhale) No. If Oliver will not seek me out, then I will leave him be. (dry laugh) The Avatar of Death shall live. (heavy inhale) Martin’s going to be thrilled.

[He exhales, starts walking.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE UK, NEAR JUDE PERRY’S DOMAIN]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The background is a-crackling. It sounds like fire. Under it all, is something that sounds like a high-pitched whirring – at least, until you realize that they’re screams.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin? Still with me?

MARTIN
(very shaky) Y-Y-Ye-Yeah, Yeah. (beat) Oh, Jesus!

ARCHIVIST
Some fears don’t need to be intensified. Only manifested.

MARTIN
Are we even going to be able to make it through all that?

[Something crumples; it sounds somewhere in between flopping cardstock and thunder.]
ARCHIVIST
It’s a maze in there – deliberately so. People running, desperately struggling for fire escapes only to find them blocked.

We won’t get lost, though. I know the route.

MARTIN
That’s… not really what I was getting at, John.

ARCHIVIST
Go on.

MARTIN
…Seriously? You don’t – It’s on fire, John; it’s –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Mm –

MARTIN
(overlapping) – it’s a burning. Building!

ARCHIVIST
Yes, it is.

MARTIN
That’s on fire!

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
Right. You are aware that traditionally, wading into a flaming inferno is actually considered bad for your health!

ARCHIVIST
(a bit tired; we’ve been here before) Yes, Martin. It’ll be fine.

MARTIN
Alright, I just wanted to check. So. Okay. We’re planning to go through… all this, so I’m guessing the fire can’t actually burn us! Right? John?

ARCHIVIST
Um…

MARTIN
(please say yes) John?

ARCHIVIST
(how to say this?) Um… mm –

MARTIN
John.

ARCHIVIST
I-It’s complicated.

MARTIN
Well, if you want me to go in there with you, then I suggest you find a way to make it – simple! (firm) Yes or no, can that fire hurt us?

ARCHIVIST
Define ‘hurt.’

MARTIN
(no-nonsense) Will the fire feel hot to me?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
Will it cause me lots of pain if I touch it?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, though not as much as –

MARTIN
(overlapping, increasingly frantic) Will it burn me alive and kill me dead?

ARCHIVIST
No. It can’t do us any permanent harm – once we’re out, we’ll be fine.

MARTIN
(ever-so-slightly shaky) You are aware that intense pain can do you loads of harm, even if there’s no, you know, physical injury –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping, snapping) Yes, I know, okay! (immediate sigh) I’ll take us through the parts that are more… subdued.

[Martin takes a breath to start to say something; the Archivist rolls on.]
ARCHIVIST
It goes in phases; sometimes there are whole apartments that aren’t actively on fire for… hours!

MARTIN
(flat) How reassuring.

ARCHIVIST
(snapping again) Well, it’s the best I can do!

MARTIN
You’re sure there isn’t another way?

[He sighs. Silence, but for the background crackling.]
MARTIN
Yeah, I know, the journey will be the journey, blah blah ominous blah.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

MARTIN
It’s fine. I know you wouldn’t take me through if we didn’t actually need to go through, so…

[Silence – then, a soft exhale.]
MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
Well…

MARTIN
John, is there another way?

ARCHIVIST
I mean – sort of? Maybe?

MARTIN
(realizing) That turn. You – You took a hard turn after the roots back there; I knew that was a thing! Why are we here?

ARCHIVIST
It’s just – when you said –

MARTIN
(overlapping, hard) John, why have you taken us here?

ARCHIVIST
Jude Perry.

[Silence.]
ARCHIVIST
This is where Jude Perry rules.

[Another silence.]
MARTIN
That’s the one who burned your hand, isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

[Slight pause, filled by another thunder-like crack and crumble.]
MARTIN
Right. I just assumed it would be… who was that landlord guy?

ARCHIVIST
Arthur Nolan. He’s here; he has a part of it, but it’s… huge. Bigger than you could believe. There’s so much fear in there.

MARTIN
But we’re not going after him, are we.

ARCHIVIST
No.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
You said you were onboard.

MARTIN
I was! I am. I just thought –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) It wouldn’t hurt?

MARTIN
That we’d be safe.

ARCHIVIST
I never said –

MARTIN
(overlapping) I know! I know, okay, I just – (bracing exhale) Look, I j,just – don’t want to get burned, all right? It’s, it’s like my least favorite pain ever.

ARCHIVIST
Is that – a joke?

MARTIN
(a bit faster, a bit shaky) No, no, okay? I, I legitimately hate burns, alright? They’re, they’re awful, and they scar horribly, and they just – it – it just makes me sick; I, I hate it. Hate it!

ARCHIVIST
Alright. If you really don’t want to do this, w-we can go another way.

MARTIN
(somewhat smaller) Really?

ARCHIVIST
Really. My revenge… (long sigh) Well, let’s just say you’re more important.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
(inhale) It’s not just your revenge though, is it? Destroying her… it would help all those people in there, wouldn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Maybe? It’s… (inhale) Like I said, I can’t see the future. It wouldn’t free them, if that’s what you’re asking. ‘Free’ doesn’t really exist in this place.

MARTIN
Apart from us.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose. In a sense, though – (dry laughing) How much of that is because we are trapped in our own quest to –

MARTIN
(overlapping) Okay, let’s, let’s not dive into another – ontological debate right now. Not here.

ARCHIVIST
Fair enough. So are we going in or not?

MARTIN
You’re – I, you’re asking me?

ARCHIVIST
I should have told you before, so – I leave the decision to you. You know my feelings on the matter.

MARTIN
I… do?

ARCHIVIST
I – Oh, right: I want revenge on Jude Perry. I want to… smite her. Make her feel what – (sigh) What all her victims felt.

But I’m not willing to force you to suffer for it.

MARTIN
Okay. So it’s – (brief pause) I have to choose, do I?

ARCHIVIST
Or we could sit here.

MARTIN
…No. No, I’m not going to choose; I don’t, I don’t think that’s a fair decision to put on me. It’s your revenge; your choice, not mine.

[Silence.]
ARCHIVIST
Fine. We go in.

[That crumpling again.]
MARTIN
(inhale, shaky, a bit surprised) Al-Alright then!

ARCHIVIST
We’ll be fine.

MARTIN
J– Lead the way.

[They start walking.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE UK, JUDE PERRY’S DOMAIN]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[A fluorescent light hums.]
[The crackling of flames is closer, here. More distinct. There’s a rushing sound, like hissing air – a thinning fire extinguisher, perhaps?]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Home. Such a simple word. Home – not house, not dwelling, not residence or address, not domicile or flat or lodging or abode or apartment or property or accommodation. Home.

A structure of brick or wood or concrete or canvas. A box in which you pack yourself away when the long day is done. A book neatly closed and placed snugly on a shelf.

There’s no place like home. An Englishman’s home is his castle. Home is where the heart is.

[In the background, indistinct words come through, seemingly over a loudspeaker.]
And home is where that heart can be hurt most severely, because within that place of safety, the warm and welcoming embrace of the cramped and well-trod floors whose layout has ingrained itself into your soul, there you are most vulnerable.

Your home is an extension of yourself, as much as you will let it be, and the place and the people and the things that form it and fill it are as much a part of you as your blood. As your bile. As your tears.

Perhaps you know the feeling that comes rushing over you when your home is compromised, invaded, corrupted. Perhaps a burglary gives lie to the promise of safety you took from a flimsy front door and a cheap lock.

Maybe the dirt and grime builds up to such a degree that the stench begins to infect your soul, or an infestation of moths or ants or bed bugs stretches itself throughout the very structure of your home until it feels like your skin is squirming with them.

You may even find yourself living with a hostile, toxic presence, whether they be family, friend, or stranger, that poisons your home, turning blessed relief and rest from the tribulations of the world into a choking fog of anxiety and fear.

Such are the dangers of a rotten home.

But how many truly control their home? How many have extended their soul into the walls of a place that exists only at the whim of those who would let them die in the street were it not for the gain that can be squeezed from them.

A home that you can not control, that you cannot even be sure will exist with the turning of the seasons. Where stability and peace rot in calamity, exist only at the behest of faceless names that lace themselves throughout labyrinthine paperwork, chaining you to the front of a truck whose motion you cannot control.

Do you smell smoke? Do you smell the creeping ruin of a life, a stalking creature of unmaintained electricals, of cheap insulation, of cutting corners and missing fire alarms and unenforced safety regulations?

Do you see it creeping under the door to your bedroom as you sleep, the burning coals of its eyes regarding you in the supposed safety of your home, not indifferent but hungry, eager to take everything from you, to burn down your life in any sense it can reach.

Can you hear the crackling promise of kindled despair that it whispers into your uneasy, dreaming ear?

Sabina senses it, feels it drawing near.

How long has she lived here? How long have these cramped, dingy rooms in the back of this – sprawling rundown tenement been the place her heart calls home?

She cannot recall, but long enough for her to grow into love for it, to cherish every rusted appliance, every crumbling piece of plasterboard, every flickering lightbulb.

Even as the widening cracks and spreading mold fill her heart with dread, they gently, slowly, inch by inch approach the room where her parents lie sleeping.

Sabina – cannot picture their faces, but knows that should they wake to see the state of the place, their anger would be blistering. She sits there on the ratty, torn sofa, trying to bring herself to stand up, to do something about the place that is crumbling around her.

But she is locked there by the sure knowledge that anything she touches could result in the loss of any small stability she has. She barely notices how hot her tears are becoming.

Which sense is the first to warn her? What nerves are the first ones to fire the white-hot bolts of agonizing panic through Sabina’s body? Does she smell it, the rising smoke? A slow and subtle scent, like someone’s burned their toast, and – is that hair?

Does she hear it, the distant roaring, like the soft growl of a lion who never stops approaching, spotted with shrieks and screams that might just be her imagination?

Does she see it, the glow of the flames, pulsing slow and steady, the dull orange of old streetlights, but somehow strong enough to push through the cracks around the front door?

Does she feel it, the rising prickly heat, like she has sat too close to an electric radiator for too long, and her skin has begun to redden and blossom before the bars into thick beads of sweat?

Or does she taste it in the back of her throat, the sick, queasy terror that tells her she knows exactly what is coming. Because it’s all happened before.

Once again, the handle of the front door begins to glow red-hot, the metal bending and distorting as it melts. From the crack underneath, the fire drags itself forward, curling and caressing the rough coir of the mat that cheerily announced ‘Welcome Home!’

Its movements are flickering, rhythmic, almost hypnotic, and as her mind screams at her to stand, to run, to escape, she simply sits there, eyes locked on the dancing lights emerging around her front door.

She smiles the same smile she did when she was a child, staring at the bonfire at camp, though every nerve in her body is alight with fear.

Then the welcome mat ignites completely, in an instant turning from a gentle smoulder to a gout of flame, and whatever strange compulsion holds her in place snaps like a wire cable.

She leaps to her feet and starts screaming, calling for help for her parents. She runs to the door to their room but as she approaches she can already feel the heat wafting out from behind it. She can hear them crying out in agony, begging for her to save them as their pain crescendos.

She can smell the oily reek of charred skin as they call to her: “We’re burning! We’re burning! Oh please, god, Sabina; we’re burning!”

She grabs the handle, ignoring the sizzling of her own flesh and pushing through the lancing needles of torment to force it down, trying to free her unseen parents. But the door latch never really aligned properly, you see. The landlord always said he was going to get it fixed, and – it refuses to open.

[We hear all of this as it’s happening in the background, minus any actual voices. The sizzling, the growing fire, the creaking and groaning of the flat – it’s there. We’re there.]
Sabina pounds helplessly on the smoking wood as the voices of her parents go quiet. Pushing down a grief that threatens to overwhelm her senses, she charges to the window, rushing to reach the old fire escape beyond.

The window frame never really opened properly, you see. The landlord always said he was going to get it fixed. And it judders as she tries to force it open, freezing a few inches from the bottom.

Sabina pushes all her might into it but the glass cracks and shatters, peppering her with razor-sharp shards, cutting her face to ribbons.

She stumbles, trying to climb through the jagged window regardless, and she can feel the cool iron of the fire escape, a moment of blessed relief that shines through her suffering.

But the fire escape was always really rusty, you see. The landlord always said he was going to replace it. And at the first tiny bit of weight she puts upon it, she can feel the fastenings pop out of the old brick one by one, and her salvation tumbles away into the impossible distance below.

What floor was her flat on again? Surely it can’t be this high.

Falling back into the inferno that is now her home, Sabina dashes over to the laughably small fire extinguisher the landlord begrudgingly provided. It is sputtering and empty.

She runs to the sink, to the tap that has always made that unpleasant grinding sound, and turning it, unleashes only a slow trickle of a thick, dark, oozing substance that smells faintly of gas.

Limping and desperate, she turns to see her furniture in flames, the bookshelves full of memories that she can’t quite place but knows are precious to her curl and float away as ash. The photos on the wall of her family –

[A static begins to rise. And then:]

[The static is still steadily rising in volume.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
(continuing) – she loves, begin to blacken as the glass –

MARTIN
(background) John!

[He coughs.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
(continuing) – pops out of the frame.

Her home is being eaten alive by –

MARTIN
(overlapping, coming into focus) John, you idiot! Please go back!

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
(continuing) – this devouring Desolation, and she –

MARTIN
JOHN!

[He slaps the Archivist.]
[Somewhere, another fire escape crumples. People scream.]
MARTIN
She’s here.

[A thunder-like crackling.]
ARCHIVIST
Hello, Jude.

JUDE PERRY
Fancy seeing you both here. (sarcasm) To what, exactly, do I owe the pleasure – the honor – of being graced by the great and powerful Archivist, harbinger of this new world and his, mm… (deliberately obtuse) …valet?

ARCHIVIST
Naturally, we came to see you.

[Jude inhales.]
JUDE
What a treat.

[Martin coughs in the background. It’s wheezy.]
ARCHIVIST
I have a question for you. I’ve been wondering: did you know what you were doing?

[Martin continues to cough; he’s picking up steam.]
JUDE
Excuse me?

ARCHIVIST
When you burned me. Marked me with… Did you know it would lead to – all this?

JUDE
(unimpressed) You came all this way just to ask that?

ARCHIVIST
Answer the question.

[Martin coughs again.]
JUDE
If you want to know so badly, why don’t you just reach into my head and pull it out?

ARCHIVIST
Because I want to hear you say it. Willingly.

JUDE
What difference does it make if –

ARCHIVIST
(snapping) Just answer the damn question!

[Slight pause.]
JUDE
No. I had no idea.

ARCHIVIST
So why did you do it?

JUDE
Why d’you think? Because I wanted to hurt you.

[Martin coughs.]
JUDE
Because you were annoying and I didn’t like you, so I hurt you.

ARCHIVIST
And if you had?

JUDE
But I didn’t. Look, I don’t care, okay?

[Martin keeps coughing.]
JUDE
I just – I don’t. Raking over the past like it matters, like it means anything. The past is dead, Archivist: ashes in the wind.

We’re. Here. Now. And that’s it.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose you’re right.

[Coughing.]
JUDE
So the real question is: What happens now?

[The fire rushes up in volume and intensity.]
MARTIN
John, look out!

JUDE
What’s wrong? Scared of a little flame?

[Martin breathing comes out shaky, scrambled.]
JUDE
(delighted) Oh, you are, aren’t you?

[She laughs.]
JUDE
How pathetic.

MARTIN
(high) Screw you!

ARCHIVIST
Leave him alone.

JUDE
(to Archivist) You’re not scared, though, are you, Archivist?

ARCHIVIST
I can feel the pain of every person you have trapped here. My own isn’t all that different.

JUDE
Yeah, but you like seeing their pain, don’t you? Their fear?

[Briefest of pauses.]
ARCHIVIST
Yes.

JUDE
You and your stupid Eye, god, you make me sick! Lording it over everybody like you own the place? You’re just leeches. Voyeurs. Parasites on the real monsters.

[Martin coughs.]
ARCHIVIST
Enough.

[Beat.]
JUDE
(whatever) Fine. Just messing around! Wouldn’t want to keep you from your oh-so-special business, your holiness.

ARCHIVIST
I wouldn’t worry about that: I’m right where I want to be.

JUDE
What’s that supposed to mean?

ARCHIVIST
I’m here for you, Jude. To end you.

JUDE
What? No! No way.

[Martin’s breath hitches, and then he’s wheezing again.]
JUDE
You won. What would be the point of… (trailing off) You’re bluffing.

ARCHIVIST
You know I’m not. You’re already afraid.

[The crackling of the flames increases in intensity.]
JUDE
Oh, I see. I get it. You finally get a sniff of power, and the first thing you do is try to settle some old scores.

[She doesn’t sound afraid. Martin continues to cough.]
JUDE
(enjoying this) Play the big man; get off on good old-fashioned petty revenge.

ARCHIVIST
(not in the mood for games) I’d have thought that was a mindset you would appreciate. Now, feel it. All the terror and pain you’ve inflicted.

JUDE
(shut up) Oh, piss off –

[She cuts herself off with a gasp. She’s feeling it.]
[When she starts talking this time, she’s bargaining.]
JUDE
Look, look. Wait. Right? I’m sorry, okay? I shouldn’t have burned your hand.

[Her words are almost slurred.]
ARCHIVIST
(unforgiving) No. You shouldn’t have.

JUDE
(slowly) Please don’t kill me, I – sure, I –

[Martin coughs.]
JUDE
– moan about the Eye; who doesn’t? But – we’ve won, both of us! And that’s great.

[In the background, ever so slightly under all the fire, we hear the high-pitched whine of the Archivist’s new top layer of static. The squeaky one, the one that signals something big.]
JUDE
If I’d known, would I still have marked you? Yes. I would. I’m… happy in this world. I belong here.

And so do you.

[Martin coughs. And coughs, and coughs, and coughs. It sounds like he’s hacking his own lungs up. It sounds bad.]
[The static is building.]
[As Jude keeps going, her breaths come in gasps and]
JUDE
(somewhat of a laugh) Listen, listen. You’re enjoying this, right? Of course you are. You want to use those powers of yours to hurt people. You want to murder everybody who can’t fight back at you now?

I can help you.

[But even as she offers, the beginnings of the glitching that warns it’s all about to be over start to flicker into audible territory.]
MARTIN
(half screaming) Just DIE already!

JUDE
You’re not – better – (audibly struggling) than – me!

[She yells. The glitching crescendos. It bursts, just like it had with the Not!Sasha.]
[And then, quicker than it came, it fades.]
[The Archivist exhales.]
[Martin’s breaths come fast and shaky.]
MARTIN
Is it? –

ARCHIVIST
It’s over.

[The flames still crackle on.]
ARCHIVIST
She’s gone.

MARTIN
The fires are still here. Doesn’t look like much has changed.

ARCHIVIST
No. I suppose not.

[Another fire escape crumples.]
MARTIN
Let’s just get out of here.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[INT. A HOUSE]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[There’s the creaking air of a large house. A few drawn-out shuffles of movement. The groaning floorboards of languid motions as someone moves across the floor. Underneath it all, the obtrusive tick-tock tick-tock of a clock.]
[A static builds.]
[The movement stops.]
[When Martin speaks, his voice is just the slightest bit echoey.]
MARTIN
Oh! Hello. (bit of a halting laugh) …What are you? Do I – Do I know you? (heh) Can’t –

[The floorboards creak as he shifts.]
MARTIN
Can’t tell through the – fog, sometimes. You feel – n,not friendly. Familiar?

Shape of you in my hand. I talk to you, don’t I? We talk. What do we – do we say? (under breath) Can’t quite –

[Movement.]
MARTIN
(normal) Th-There’s something there, but I just can’t see it.

Anyway. (slight sigh) Ni-Nice to sit down. Take a load off.

[He sits down in a chair with a scoot.]
MARTIN
Not a comfortable chair, of course. No-None of them are, here. I’ve – I’ve been all over this house looking for a nice place to sit. (unsure) I – think.

Is that what I was looking for? (remembers himself) Um. Ei-Either way, this place is so huge… so… empty, by the time you find your way to anything at all, you’ve probably earned a sit-down.

[He lets out a small laugh.]
[Then there’s a creaking sound – like a door opening? Or just the floor and walls again?]
MARTIN
(small laugh) I don’t think there’s anyone else here, I –

[Another creak.]
MARTIN
Pro-Probably never has been. Not that I can remember, at least.

[The wind/air begins to pick up.]
MARTIN
Is it my house?

It must be, right? It must be, ‘cause – why else would I be here?

You don’t just wander around other people’s houses alone; you don’t just…

You don’t just… just wander. (under breath, smaller) No…

[He trails off.]
MARTIN
(bit dazed) What, what was I saying? I don’t…

[A squeak – again, possibly a door – and some background rattling.]
MARTIN
(to tape) Do you remember? You store them, I suppose. Keep, keep stuff locked up in those little wheels. That’s memory, isn’t it? (movement) Computers used to be like you. Big, whirring things with loads of – uh, tape. They called that memory.

But it’s not – not, not really; it’s just numbers and… (trails off) (movement)

Maybe you’re blank as well, same as me.

Are you? Can you remember what I’ve already said, – (movement) – cause I – I, I can’t; the words keep creeping away? Like – like, like when I try to think back, to focus – um, focus on – um –

[He’s trying very hard to remember.]
[Static swells.]
MARTIN
(pleasantly surprised) Oh, oh! Oh. Hello! What are you; I can’t quite – see. You feel – familiar. Do I know you, do we talk?

I hope so. (slight laugh) It’s good to talk with people. It’s – hm.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
Oh, I, I met someone; did I tell you? (movement) He’s – I, I don’t know. I like him. He doesn’t like me, though. Not really. I don’t blame him.

I don’t like me sometimes, and I am me. Plus he’s – he’s my, my boss? Is that right?

Ei, Ei,Either way, it’s probably for the best. Wouldn’t really be appropriate. You don’t need to worry; I’m not doodling his name on my desk or anything. (heh) His uh – his – his, um. His… name…

Wait.

[Squeak, like a door opening.]
MARTIN
Wait, what is his name? (distressed) I don’t – (more distressed, sharper) Why, wha– Why can’t I remember his name?

His, his face, I don’t –

[More movement, and a thud. The door closing?]
[Martin steps into the next room.]
MARTIN
(still audibly agitated) Wh-Where am I? This, This isn’t my house!

H-Hello?

I don’t like it here. I can’t see anything with all this –

[He moves something that sounds like a curtain on a metal rod aside.]
MARTIN
This fog; this – this is nothing out the windows, and it’s, it’s so cold.

[The rushing of the air increases in volume.]
MARTIN
(audibly shivering) The fireplace is dead and the curtains… there are mirrors but no…

No. Not mirrors.

Someone’s standing in them but I don’t, I don’t know who.

That face, who is… who is that? (under breath) I need to sit down.

[He walks to find a chair, his breaths coming slightly shakier and faster, though still soft in volume.]
[The chair creaks as he sits in it.]
[The clock ticks at a slightly different pace.]
[A static rises.]
MARTIN
(pleasant surprise) Oh! Oh, hello. (small laugh) Who are you, then?

Hmm. Hm. Can’t quite make out a – A tape recorder? (heh) Can’t remember the last time I used a –

[Creak.]
MARTIN
Hm. Blast from the past! Familiar…

Well, it’s good to have someone to talk to. Otherwise you can go strange, you… I, I don’t…

Hm. What was I saying?

This… this chair, – (an *ugh* and chair scraping back) – really isn’t comfortable. I had a look-round for better places to sit – did I tell you that? – but it’s, it’s big house.

My house, I think. (heh) Nowhere comfortable. So I suppose this is it.

It is my house, isn’t it? Must be. Must be.

I don’t really remember. Just… so tired. It’s hard to think when you’re this tired, hard to… to focus.

No, no, no, no, not, not tiredness, just the – fog. I – can’t see through the fog, and it – it smells! (movement) (sniff)

What – (sniff) What is that? Damp, sort of – chemical, almost. (larger sniff) I don’t like it.

Why does my house smell like that, I – It can’t be my house.

[He starts walking again.]
MARTIN
No, no, no; my,  (sniff) my – (sniff) My house doesn’t smell like this! My house smells… s-smells different. (pause) It’s sort of weird, isn’t it? Smell can trigger memory so… powerfully. Like this one, it, it makes me think of – (large inhale) Hm. (inhale) Hm. I – I don’t know. Is it a person? A place?

No, no; people – people don’t smell like that. Besides, I’m all alone.

[Creak.]
MARTIN
I’m all – (movement) I’m all alone. (distressed) Why – Why am I alone? I, I shouldn’t be alone; there should be people! It’s such a – such a big house, my house – there mu– there must be other people! People who care!

[Opening and creaking of the door, more walking.]
MARTIN
Hello?

[He keeps going. The door creaks behind him.]
MARTIN
He-Hello?

[He keeps walking.]
MARTIN
All these rooms… I think they’re the same as this one. I, I don’t know why I’d decorate my house like this; I don’t like it! I like – (breaking off) Wh– I, It’s not my home; it can’t be. Do I have a home? This – this place feels like it’s all for me, I think, but I don’t –

[Door creaks open.]
MARTIN
(shaky) I don’t like it here.

It – It can’t be cheap living here, house this big. I really need a job.

Started lying on my CV; did I tell you that. I didn’t want to. I-I mean I tried to be a good person, but we’re really up against it, and I – and I – I know they’re going to find me out; I just know it.

They’ll ask something, or I’ll say something stupid, and then – and then they’ll know. They’ll know, and then – (shaky exhale) (under breath) Oh, [unintelligible] (normal) What am I doing; I can’t afford a place like this! I need money, not just for me, but for – for… (suddenly less agitated) Wait. Wait, no; it is – it is just me, isn’t it? It’s always been just me.

[The same static as always begins to rise from the background.]
MARTIN
No… No, no, no, that’s not right! I-I’m not alone, no! Not alone, there’s – there’s – J-J-John? John. (suddenly realizing) John! John!

[A thump. Martin starts walking.]
MARTIN
(suddenly to John, frantic) John? John, I’m here; can you hear me? I can’t – it’s – it’s this place, I – wh-where are you; I need you, I nee– (laugh, but humorless) – I need you, John.

[There’s an uneasy discordant tone playing in the background.]
MARTIN
Where – Where did you go.

[A couple more steps.]
MARTIN
(voice about to break) Please don’t leave me. I can’t do this on my own. Please. (inhale that could be a sob) I’m not enough on my own.

Alone. (small, shaky) All. All alone.

[He starts to cry, softly, as he walks on. There’s some rustled movement.]
[And then – the static rises.]
MARTIN
(pleasant surprise) Oh. Oh, hello. What’s this?

Wow, retro! What are you up to, little buddy; just – listening?

That’s okay. It’s nice to have someone to talk to.

[Creak.]
MARTIN
Maybe you can keep a better handle on things than me.

It’s this fog, you know? Makes it so hard to see. (under breath) WhatwasIsaying? (normal) I feel like there’s somewhere I need to be. But no, no; this is my house; where else would I need to be?

I just –

[Scoot.]
MARTIN
I wish I had comfortable chairs. (inhale) Would be nice to have somewhere relaxing to sit down. Rest a bit when Mum’s asleep.

Did I tell you about my mum?

[Creak.]
MARTIN
(half-whisper) We should try to keep quiet actually, you know. Make sure not to wake her. The drugs – they, they hit her pretty hard, but – if you make enough noise and she wakes up, and – (quieter) and yeah, it’s not good. (bravado) Not a good time!

I-I know she loves me; I-I know she does.

But that doesn’t make it easy. There’s always so much to do, and I’m always forgetting something.

I do try, you know? I mean, I really try to keep on top of things, but I’m just – I’m just so forgetful, and she – she –

Sometimes I wonder if I forget things on purpose. Easier not to think about them, I guess. Easier to just let them… slip away. They can’t hurt you if you don’t think about them; they can’t shout at you or call you names. (increasingly emotional) And I, I always think of Mum’s face when I’ve done something wrong, and I – (dead sober) Wait.

[He shifts.]
MARTIN
Wait, her face, I – I don’t – I don’t remember her face.

Did – Did she have a face? (berating) D-Don’t – Don’t be stupid, Martin; of course she had a face! (increasingly agitated) You just can’t remember it ‘cause – (breathing heavy) ‘Cause you’re a bad son; because you left you left her to rot in – (brief pause) (despondent)

Wh-Where did she go?

She didn’t like it; I didn’t like it. S-Smelled. It smelled like –

Where am I? This isn’t right; I shouldn’t be here; I should be –

Somewhere, someone that – there, there are people who trust me, people who love me, so why can’t I remember them? Why, why can’t I see them?

Sasha. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, I, I remember; there was – there was Sasha! I can see her face!

No – no, wait, no; not, not Sasha, some – something else. The thing that isn’t Sasha, that, that took her, and, and made her – something else, and her – face, her – her face, I can still see it; it’s – laughing.

[He’s breathing heavier, now.]
MARTIN
Telling me that there’s – there’s nobody else. I’m alone. The only people who could ever stand to be around me are gone. Even from my mind. (tearful) Where is this place? So cold. And I can’t see anything through all this – fog. (hm) I must have – left the window open. (struggles with the next word) L, L-L,Let the fog in.

Oh, my heating bills must be through the roof, stupid; can’t afford that!

At least I’ve got a job now; did I tell you I’ve got a job? I mean, the interview was weird, I-I don’t really remember the man who talked to me. Just his eyes.

They stared at me. Th-Through me, and – and I knew he knew what I had done.

God. I was so scared, but then he smiled, and shook my hand.

What was his name?

He said I ‘had the job,’ (heh) that he ‘looked forward to working with me.’

I was still so scared I could barely move my arm. I was so terrified I’d let him down.

[The static is once again starting to rise.]
MARTIN
And then I met John, and I – (realization) John – John! John! John? John, I’m here! John, I-I think I’m lost, I think – I don’t – (losing his grasp) John.

[But he’s losing his words again.]
[Another creak.]
[The clock ticks on.]
[The static rises again with a little squeak.]
MARTIN
(pleasant surprise) Oh, he-hello! What are you?

Huh. Didn’t even know I had a tape recorder. Do you still work, or…

[He taps on it.]
MARTIN
Yeah, seems like you’re running all right. (beat) Hey, I should do some poetry! You could give it a little, little bit of that funky lo-fi goodness! All the cool poets love a bit of tape hiss, right?

Maybe find somewhere different to sit, though.

[He scoots out of the chair.]
MARTIN
(under breath) Hate these chairs. Don’t even know where I got them.

Did I tell you I’ve been writing poetry? N,Nothing much really, just fragments, thoughts. Haven’t written anything like it since I was a teenager, – (small laugh) – but my new job’s a lot, and – I don’t know. Something about that place, it just – it makes me feel weird?

But – the sort of weird you just have to get out somehow.

Maybe I – Maybe I should do some open mics, or something. Just for me, really, I think.

Oh! You – You want to hear some? (heh) (movement)

Uh – yeah! Yeah, okay, sure; well, I can – No. No, wait, no that – (movement) Hm, they’re gone; that’s weird. I thought – I, I can feel them, but the words, they just – just wash away.

Hm.

I, I m – I suppose that’s quite poetic actually, but – (sigh) Nothing else there.

I don’t like this place. (exhale) It’s so cold, and, and the logs in the fireplace are damp from the mist. I don’t know how I’d even light them, and they – they smell really bad, like they’re wet dirt.

Makes me think of – hm.

When I was nine, my grandad died. Did I tell you that? I went to the funeral, and the coffin was so – (small laugh) shiny. It was already sealed.

But on top there was a photo of a – young man. Someone who looked almost like my grandad, but – it, it wasn’t him. It wasn’t… finished? Not yet.

No, and – and I suddenly began to panic, because I was trying to remember what he looked like, his, his face, but I couldn’t do it. And I knew I’d never see him again.

He loved me and I couldn’t even remember his face!

(breathing heavy) It was – It was a horrid, drizzly morning, that day, and they put him in the ground and he – he smelled like earth. Cold, damp soil. (squeak, movement) What was I saying?

Ah – S, Sorry – (sorry exhale) It’s just this chair-

[Squeak and movement sounds as he gets up.]
MARTIN
– it’s so hard to concentrate when you’re uncomfortable, isn’t it?

[He sighs.]
[A few more creaks.]
[The static rises.]
MARTIN
Now, I think – Hey, hang on. Where did you come from?

Tape recorder. (heh) What, you want me to give you a statement, I –

[The static presses.]
MARTIN
(deadened voice) Why. The Eye has won. It can already see everything; it wouldn’t need a – w-wouldn’t need a –

[The static fades.]
MARTIN
(stuttering, stumbling) Well it’s just, nice to talk to someone, I guess. No one real ever really listens to me anyway.

Oh, they nod and respond and say ‘No, Martin,’ or ‘Not now, Martin,’ or ‘Leave it, Martin –’ but, funny thing is – (false bright) I didn’t ask them to do anything!

Just wanted to see if they needed a hand. (heh, but humorless) Is that me? (unsure) Is – Is that me? Martin? Martin. Maartin. (close to John’s pronunciation) Martin.

Doesn’t sound right. But who else would I be? (hm) Whoever owns this house, I guess. It certainly doesn’t seem like the kind of place that somebody called Maartin would live.

Martin.

It feels like a small name. One that wants to be warm and happy. Not like here.

[Creak.]
MARTIN
You know, I’ve wandered around all these rooms, and – they all just make me feel alone.

They scare me.

Even when I find someone else, I feel alone. Did I tell you?

I – found someone else, wandering around. They were all – thin and grey. Faded. Like they’d been here for ages. I think they’d been – crying, but it’s so hard to tell through the fog.

I tried to talk to them, but it was just – just difficult! I asked who they were, and they – looked at me like they had no idea what I was talking about.

“What’s your name?” I said, “Your name? You must have a name!” but they just – shrugged, and I – and – (movement) And they gestured at me. Like they wanted to know my name, and I – th– I couldn’t tell them! I couldn’t remember!

“Is this your house?” I asked, and they said, they said yes. But – then they stopped, and shook their head. And, and then they started to laugh.

Quietly, for a bit, and then they cried. And they wouldn’t stop. I – I –

They asked me who they were, if there was anyone looking for them. If there was anybody left who even cared, but I – I didn’t know. I, I didn’t know, and I –

[His voice is shaking. He’s clearly emotional.]
MARTIN
(tearful) I ran away – I had to run away! (sob) I, I had to go and have a sit-down, okay? I just – (creak, movement) I just wish I had thought to buy some nicer chairs.

Still. Not like I’ve got guests coming, is it? (shaky breath) The house is empty, and, and honestly? I – I can’t think of anyone in the world who would care if I lived or died.

[The clock ticks on, insistent and unyielding.]
MARTIN
(sob, quiet) I-I-I’m scared. I think this fog is doing something to me; I can’t – (movement) I’m losing myself, and I – and I don’t know if I mind?

Maybe I deserve it. (shaky breath) So much of what’s behind the fog hurts. So much of it just makes me wanna curl up with pain and embarrassment and –

Maybe the fog’s here because I want it here.

Is that why I opened the windows?

Maybe I asked the fog to come. (beat) No. No, no – no, no, no, that’s not true, I – I remember! Hundreds, thousands of lost souls, wandering the halls. Hollow memories, with eyes full of tears.

I’ve seen them. (shaky) They’re all trying to remember. T-To recall, to picture someone, anyone who loves them, and their hearts are all full of fear.

Afraid that those people are gone forever. That maybe – maybe they never existed at all. (agitated) Why am I here?

I-I fell behind. I was – I was too slow, and, and, and the fog caught up; I was following. Al-Always following, never leading. Never leading.

Why did he leave me behind? D-Did he? Who are – Wh– Who are you? Who am –? (realization, movement) J-J-John.

[The static kicks in again.]
MARTIN
John, John. Yes. John, I remember him. (shaky exhale) I need to, I need to keep him here. If he can find me, I – he, he knows enough; surely he Knows enough to find me, but I can’t – (struggling) If I forget him, if, if I forget – me – maybe – maybe there’s nothing left to Know. No one to find.

[Creaking movement.]
MARTIN
Talking helps. I got you all here to listen; (tap) Just, just don’t stop talking.

You – You are Martin Blackwood. Yes. You, you didn’t choose to be here. John is coming. (stronger) I am Martin Blackwood, and I am not lonely anymore; I am not lonely anymore. (voice shaking with effort) I want to have friends; I – no, I have friends. I-I’m in love. (heh) I am in love, and I will not forget that; I will not forget. (stronger) I am Martin Black–

ARCHIVIST
(far off, calling) Martin!

MARTIN
Wai– wh– John?

ARCHIVIST
(getting closer) Martin! Martin?

MARTIN
John! John, over here!

[And the static is growing louder.]
ARCHIVIST
Oh! Martin, hold on, I, I, I’m coming; I just –

[Footsteps.]
ARCHIVIST (ON MIC)
(relieved) Oh, Martin; thank god, I – I was –

[And it sounds like he’s embracing him]
ARCHIVIST
I, I thought you were behind me.

[Martin lets out a soft oh.]
MARTIN
I thought you’d left me behind. Gone on without me.

ARCHIVIST
No, never. N-Never, I, I just –

[He pulls back from the hug.]
ARCHIVIST
I, I didn’t want to – Look too h– I,I,I promised I wouldn’t Know you, and, and with the fog, and, and all the rooms, I, I just – I lost you; I’m – (inhale) I’m sorry.

MARTIN
It’s okay.

[A beat of just their exhales.]
ARCHIVIST
No, I – I tried to use the – (sigh) to Know where you were, but it was – you, you were faint. It was so strange; it took me so long just to find you.

[Movement.]
MARTIN
John, it’s – okay. I promise, it’s okay. This place tried; it really did, and honestly, I – (inhale) I wanted to believe it.

But I didn’t.

ARCHIVIST
This… place, i, it –

[The static increases.]
ARCHIVIST
My god.

[The static fades.]
MARTIN
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
M-Martin – if you – did. I,If you wanted to forget a,all of it, stay here and just – escape.

[The wind rushes in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
I-I would understand.

[Beat.]
MARTIN
N,No. It’s comforting here, leaving all those – painful memories behind, but – (slight movement) It’s not a good comfort, it’s – i,it’s the kind that makes you fade, makes you dim and – distant.

ARCHIVIST
(barely a whisper) Okay. (pause, normal) Okay, good; I – (fortifying breath) I wanted to make sure you knew what this place was.

MARTIN
It’s the Lonely, John. It’s me.

ARCHIVIST
Not anymore.

[Martin makes a pleased little hm.]
MARTIN
No. (long inhale) No, not anymore.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. A GARDEN, JARED HOPWORTH’S DOMAIN]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Birds chirp happily, twittering about. It sounds like a lovely day, by all accounts.]
[Someone is groaning in pain.]
[We hear some clothing movements, walking. Then:]
ARCHIVIST
Don’t. Touch. Anything.

MARTIN
I wasn’t planning to.

[He gives a little heh at the end.]
MARTIN
Are they still… alive?

ARCHIVIST
More or less. They’re certainly still aware. But they’re just the compost. The pot from which the trees grow.

[As he speaks, there’s another gasping voice.]
[The birds continue to trill.]
MARTIN
I didn’t think there were that many bones in a human body.

ARCHIVIST
(half a laugh) Normally there aren’t. (exhale) It takes a skilled gardener to get them to grow like this. The curling, cascading intricacies of collagen and marrow.

[Something shifts – a footstep, in dirt?]
ARCHIVIST
It takes devotion –

MARTIN
John.

[Slight pause.]
ARCHIVIST
S-Sorry.

MARTIN
You sound like you think they’re beautiful.

[More steps.]
ARCHIVIST
Don’t you?

[Something creaks or cracks.]
MARTIN
Is he here?

ARCHIVIST
(inhale) Up ahead.

[Someone else cries out. The birds are happy as ever. And, as they get closer, it turns out someone is whistling, a joyful little tune.]
[It’s Jared Hopworth.]
JARED HOPWORTH
(to one of his person-plant-things) Look at this.

[He makes a set of tch-ing sounds of disapproval. You can practically hear him shaking his head.]
JARED
It’s like you’re trying to grow ugly. That won’t do. You’re better than that.

[The man-person-plant-thing groans again.]
JARED
Not to worry friend; no harm done. Just a bit of pruning will set you right.

[He clips something. The person-plant yells.]
[Jared shushes them as they continue to do so. They start crying, over some fleshy sounds. Water burbles.]
JARED
[No real fuss.] Should sort you right out. Soon you’ll be good as new.

[The person-thing continues to whimper in the background.]
JARED
Better, even. You just need to – reach down inside and – really feel that fear. Let it guide how you grow. You’ll feel it in your –

[He stops, snickers.]
JARED
Bones.

[And then he starts to laugh in earnest, the person still obviously in pain behind it all.]
[Something shifts, and he starts the whistling up again, rattling around what sounds like a metal wheelbarrow until –]
ARCHIVIST
Jared Hopworth.

[The whistling cuts off. The wheelbarrow – or whatever it is – rolls to a stop. Jared sets it down.]
JARED
Sure. Why not? If you’re still clinging so hard to names.

ARCHIVIST
You know why I’m here?

[In the background, we still hear the light tinkle of a bell, or a windchime, and some vague moans here and there.]
JARED
I can guess. Took a bit to find out which rib was aching, but when I did – well. Obviously. (shifting the wheelbarrow) Why shouldn’t you want it back?

ARCHIVIST
(puff of an exhale, almost a laugh) It’s too late for that now.

JARED
Not really. But – whatever.

[Pause.]
JARED
(dismissive) Oh, and who’s this? Your boyfriend?

[This is clearly meant to be a diss.]
MARTIN
Um –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Yes, actually.

JARED
(Ah!) Oh. Hm.

[In the background, a flute plays off-key.]
JARED
So is there any way this doesn’t end in me dead? I’m guessing that’s on the docket if you’re here. Unless you’re just here to smell the flowers.

[The windchimes clatter.]
ARCHIVIST
No. I can’t let you carry on like this.

What happened, Jared? I thought you only worked on the willing.

JARED
What? Says who? (realizing) Ohhh, the gym! Ha! I mean, yeah, they wanted to change, but they were still scared. First at what I’d do to them, then at what would happen if the world couldn’t handle their beautiful new bodies.

Not like I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart.

[He snorts.]
JARED
Hearts.

Anyway. Willing. Unwilling. Don’t work like that anymore, does it? You made sure of that.

MARTIN
That’s – not fair.

JARED
And what?

MARTIN
I – I – Mm, uh –

JARED
[S’right.] Don’t really matter now, does it?

ARCHIVIST
No. No, it doesn’t.

[Jared lets out a large pfffft sound. Things crack – he’s definitely restructuring his body.]
MARTIN
(ah!) O-kay.

JARED
Right. So are we doing this or what? I reckon I can get a few good hits in before I go down. Give you a little something to remember me by.

ARCHIVIST
(dead serious) No you won’t.

[Jared huffs a laugh.]
JARED
No, maybe not. But you’ve gotta try, haven’t you?

MARTIN
Please don’t.

JARED
What?

MARTIN
You’ve already made your mark.

[Jared pauses, surprised. Then he huffs a laugh again:]
JARED
Fine. Consider it a favor. But I want something in return. Before he does it.

[Squelch.]
MARTIN
Um –

ARCHIVIST
Alright. Let’s hear it.

JARED
You still do that talk-y thing? You know, drink up all the fear and spit it back out?

ARCHIVIST
Sort of, yes.

JARED
Alright. Well, I’d like to hear about my garden.

[Beat.]
ARCHIVIST
Okay.

MARTIN
Look, if this is some kind of trick –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) It isn’t.

[Squelchy-grinding as Jared shifts.]
JARED
Don’t fret yourself, little man. Just thought it might be nice, is all.

[Pause. The birds chirp.]
[And the static rises.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Cultivation notes for Fuertisium reese.1 Commonly known as the Gristlebloom Orchid.

[As the Archivist begins the statement, his voice takes on the quality of what you might hear on a nature documentary, or a scientific log.]
[Under the statement, we hear the fleshy sounds that might accompany the growth of one of Jared’s person-plant-things.]
A popular feature in any mortal garden, the striking petals that spring from the stems of the Gristlebloom are certainly dramatic, stretched and straining as they are in a kaleidoscope of reds and pinks and browns around the pale cream of bony stalk.

While proper conditions for development can be tricky to get precisely right, caution should be exercised as – should an ideal environment be created – this plant can grow and grow and grow.

[Creak.]
The soil should be prepared first, a rich and earthy cocktail of insecurity and self-hatred that allows the roots to twist and contort freely. The temperature should be kept the steady, humid warmth of air conditioners struggling to cope with the perspiration of a dozen bodies pushing themselves too hard, while the lights must be kept at a harsh, fluorescent glare.

Counterintuitively, growth is most effective when the orchid is suffering from aggressive dehydration, and it is vitally important that the air roots be rarely praised, and only for the flowers’ appearance and growth.

Above all, the deepest fear must be laced throughout what the Gristlebloom Orchid is fed: That they’re not enough. That their inadequacies are embedded all the way into their flesh, and they must always and forever be more.

This unspoken terror can be viewed in the intricate lattices that marble the gory petals of a well-cared for Gristlebloom as it expands and swells and grows to its full and bulbous potential.

Never let it believe itself good enough, and continue always to ensure the body that it is certain it must attain is that impossible, distended mess to which it will endlessly contort itself until it dominates your garden in its sheer, impossible, beautiful mass.

Even if there were mirrors in this place, Reese could not possibly recognize himself. Not because anything that might once have registered as a human body has long since blossomed into sinewy flowers and muscles and burst skin, but because – were he to see himself, the only image in his mind would be the him he was so afraid to be.

And the Gristlebloom Orchid grows.

The agonies of this gore-streaked orchid are pointedly exquisite as it willingly and keenly pushes its physical form past any recognizable point of pain and shuddering anxiety until it towers over your garden, dripping blood and bitter sweat.

[Squelch.]
Cultivation notes for Gristleium patricia.2 Commonly known as the Bone Rose.

[More squelching.]
While the Gristlebloom Orchid may be the most eye-catching of the plants that you will find in the mortal garden, the Bone Rose is perhaps the most delicate.

Thin and brittle, it is constantly on the verge of collapsing under its own weight, even as its ossified stems reach and twist and stretch in a desperate attempt for closeness.

The soil for the Bone Rose must be thoroughly rotten, a mulch of corrupted romanticism turned toxic and watered by an uncertain desire that curls back upon the roots and feeds into it a single, constant, pulsing thought, an instinct that fuels every cell within the rose:

To be wanted you must be less.

The temperature should be kept cold for optimal development, the coldness of rejection, of hostile and pitying glances cast over a hated body. A coldness that creeps through the bones and lashes the vicious iciness to the flower’s core.

Light should be unrelenting, allowing every flaw and mark and sag to be stared at and warped and ogled.

With this preparation, the Bone Rose will conceive a grotesque horror of its own flesh, of the skin and fats and all that makes a body present. It will tear and starve and leak until there is nought but bones, the hungry bones so desperate to be touched, to be held. To be wanted.

Patricia is beautiful at last, so sharp and narrow and hard. Her angles and creamy white entirety is the center of the garden for all to admire. But she strains and shakes and fears the wind that pushes and bends the brittle stiffness of the bones.

It takes every drop of her strength to keep herself aloft, to not collapse in a heap of splintered femur and broken rib. There is no moment of her new existence that is not a shuddering, terrified effort.

She is beautiful. And she cannot allow herself to lose that at any cost. She cannot shatter into fleshy ugliness again.

The Bone Rose, properly cultivated, will be a fearful and wonderful centerpiece for a carefully tended mortal garden.

Cultivation notes for Cicadium leopold.3 Commonly known as the Cutaway Tulip.

At the edges of the mortal garden, if one is lucky, one may find the rare Cutaway Tulip, the pride of any diligent gardener.

While easy to grow to a small size with some casually applied insecurities, to create a true masterpiece of carved and peeled and sculpted flesh requires a lengthy and involved cultivation.

Ensuring a properly grotesque blossom, an elegant and graceful flowering, is more in the pruning than in the preparation.

The soil can be anything mulched in hostility to self-worth, and the light and temperature must simply be kept at a level to allow the appropriate growth of an obsession.

An obsession, with the changing and hacking of itself, that from stem to root to petal it cuts and breaks and sticks itself into ever-new configurations and shapes, each a new summit of repulsive symmetry and stomach-churning perfection.

A perfection sought in the blades and the shears of the gardener. All the edge wielded by its own wildly waving roots, eagerly digging into a knotted and knitted form and pulling itself apart.

The Cutaway Tulip’s growth is less reliant than other blooms on the moment-to-moment terror of themselves, the sharpened, pointed fear of a form you are appalled to look upon.

Instead, what must be grown and fed and watered is the lingering, nagging dread of falling short of what could be. At the final, glorious culmination that a body may someday achieve, the ever-retreating perfections that sit always on the tip of a knife.

But also growing with the flower must be that other dread: Not of perfection to be hunted, but of decay to be fled. The wrinkled, graying translucent marks of encroaching mortality, a body that seeks to turn all that look like you into a moldering parody.

And the fearful slicing and desperate stabbing that is no longer to seek the golden promise of an eternal beauty but a tearful attempt to rewind a spring that ticks itself ever looser with every snap of the clock face.

Leopold is aware of what he has become, of the bleeding, twitching caricature of a human body he inhabits, the ribbons of himself that are pruned and broken and woven into dazzling petals.

But as much as he is scared to his roots of the next form the shears will chop him into, even more he fears the spreading stagnation that moves through his skin like rot, the start of decline that can only be postponed by the mutilating torments of his gardener.

He would cry, but he has no idea where his tear ducts are anymore.

While initially a very intensive and time-consuming flower to grow, a well-cared for Cutaway Tulip can stand as a torn and wretched testament to the gardener’s skill, especially if successfully brought to the point where it begins to operate and dissect itself.

Cultivation notes for Sopranium maeve.4 Commonly known as the Lily of the Damned.

While a somewhat difficult flower to acquire the seeds for, the actual growing of a Lily of the Damned is a task that requires remarkably little input from the gardener, although, if it is to be a strong feature of the mortal garden, it must be regularly pulled up into fresh air.

Any soil works for a Lily of the Damned, though some contend a rough and damp texture causes them to blossom faster. The important aspect to bear in mind is to never allow the lily to forget its physical existence.

Temperatures can be hot or cold as long as it is uncomfortable, and light levels need only be high if the preoccupation with its body’s presence has a visual component.

Most importantly, the absence of any transcendence or death should always be emphasized when watering or pruning.

Spirituality. Afterlife. Transhumanism, religion – all must be roundly dismissed or mocked, at all times with the clear conclusion that the meat from which the lily blooms is the only form of being it will ever enjoy.

The flowers that spring from a Lily of the Damned are… less predictable than those of other denizens of the mortal garden, being haphazard black growths of calcified fluid and sinuous, dangling nerves.

They can grow very fast, but are in no danger of dominating any arrangement, as they will by nature attempt to retreat beneath the soil, hiding the painful existence that horrifies them so from any that might be watching, including themselves.

Periodically, if you wish to display and grow your lily to its best advantage, you must seize whatever part of it remains above ground and pull, bringing it up into the open air.

Use as much force as you have available without worry of dislodging it entirely. The lily’s roots go deep, and can withstand almost any attempt to dislodge them.

[A cracking, curling growing.]
This is Maeve’s nightmare. There is no other word for it. To be trapped, unmoving, within the body that has betrayed her so often, feeling every sensation as it grows and warps and sprouts, never knowing what new mutation it will visit on her next.

She is unable to even hide. There is no promise of the peaceful sleep of the innocent dead, not the dream of a digital escape of the hell her body has become. She is here, and she is trapped in the same soft prison of skin she has always so despised.

While it will never be a focus piece for a mortal garden, the Lily of the Damned is a popular choice among experimental gardeners, as its almost indestructible nature allows them the opportunity to exercise a great deal of creativity in its cultivation.

The mortal garden grows and twists and screams and bleeds. It is loved by the hands that tend it, but that love sows only misery and fear.

It is the worst place that has ever been beautiful, and it should not exist.

[The static begins to simmer in the background. There are more crunchy rearrangement noises.]
[Jared takes a deep breath. Then he exhales, all juddery.]
JARED
Cheers for that.

ARCHIVIST
Don’t.

MARTIN
John, are you – alright?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. Um, uh – Sorry.

JARED
Is it really that bad? Seeing what I’ve done here?

Or – (heh) Is it maybe that deep down, you think it’s as beautiful as I do?

ARCHIVIST
(*snapping*) Shut up!

JARED
It’s a shame. Who’s gonna look after the garden when I’m gone? There are a few real pretty ones.

[Windchimes in the background.]
JARED
Who knows. Maybe they’ll uproot and start landscaping themselves. That’d be nice.

Then again, maybe it’ll just grow wild.

[The most bass layer of the Archivist’s static seems to press in.]
ARCHIVIST
I don’t. Care.

JARED
No. You don’t, do you?

[Windchimes.]
ARCHIVIST
I can’t. There’s too many. I can’t save everyone. (small sound) I can’t save anyone.

JARED
If you say so. (beat) So. I guess that just leaves revenge, then, don’t it?

Can’t say I blame you. That’s all life is, really, innit? Just people using each other up.

ARCHIVIST
(snide) Spare me the crude philosophy.

[A noise in the distance. The static begins to build.]
JARED
(to garden) Grow well, my darlings. Grow well.

ARCHIVIST
(gritted) Feel it.

[A scraping-type sound, but distant.]
ARCHIVIST
Feel the terror and despair as your garden grows.

[As he speaks, Jared begins making strange burbling and gurgling noises, his body starting to shift and squelch.]
ARCHIVIST
(intense) Let it flow through you and blossom.

[Jared keeps making noises. The Archivist’s words begin to glitch.]
ARCHIVIST
Just people, using each other up. Ceaseless Watcher, turn your gaze upon this thing and drink. Your. Fill.

[Jared groans, deep and low, and the light glitching intensifies, turning into the same final glitch that eradicated the apocalypse of the Not!Sasha and Jude Perry before him.]
[And then, one final bass boost later – it’s over. The Archivist gasps a bit for breath, but –]
MARTIN
(worried) John?

ARCHIVIST
I’m here.

MARTIN
Are you okay?

[One of the plant-person-things groans in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m –

[It groans again.]
ARCHIVIST
(not great) Great. You?

MARTIN
(bit of a laugh) I really thought this one would be messier.

ARCHIVIST
What do you mean?

MARTIN
Well I mean – he’s a Flesh – thing, right? I thought he’d be all meat and blood and gore and all that.

ARCHIVIST
(bit of a laugh) Apparently not.

MARTIN
He didn’t even put up a fight.

ARCHIVIST
No.

[Another one of the plant-people-things in the background groans. More squelching. A footstep in the dirt.]
MARTIN
So what now?

ARCHIVIST
Carry on, I guess.

MARTIN
Yeah.

[The Archivist shoulders his bag, prepares to start walking.]
MARTIN
John!

ARCHIVIST
Yeah?

MARTIN
I need to ask you something.

ARCHIVIST
Okay.

MARTIN
I meant to ask. A-After the fire, actually? But, well – there was the house and everything, and it just sort of –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) What is it? Martin.

MARTIN
Why didn’t we go after the landlord guy? In the tenement.

ARCHIVIST
Arthur Nolan?

MARTIN
Yeah. He’s still there, right?

ARCHIVIST
(bit of a sigh) After Jude, th,the fires – I,I didn’t want to put you through anymore.

MARTIN
(sigh) Don’t do that.

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
Don’t use me as an excuse.

ARCHIVIST
I-I’m not. I just – (inhale) It didn’t seem worth it. I didn’t – hate him like I hated her. (small exhale) He never hurt me.

MARTIN
But all the people inside.

ARCHIVIST
Killing Nolan wouldn’t have made it stop. It would just leave it – unsupervised.

[More gasping groans in the background. Martin hmms.]
[A sigh.]
MARTIN
John – we are doing good, right? Making things better?

[The slightest of pauses.]
ARCHIVIST
I don’t know if that was ever an option.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. A WEB DOMAIN]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Footsteps.]
[There’s a slight commotion in the background – sounds like the chattering of an audience.]
[Then a brush of fabric, and the footsteps stop. The bags jingle.]
ARCHIVIST
Ah, hold up. Uh, I, I need to, um…

MARTIN
Now? Seriously? We’re almost out of here.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
(kinda breathy) I’m sorry. Not really up to me.

MARTIN
Fine.

[He sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
If you’re bored, you could always… take in a show.

MARTIN
That’s – That’s not funny, John.

ARCHIVIST
If you say so.

MARTIN
Just – Just give me a shout when you’re done.

[As he speaks, we hear the fabric sounds of the bag and his moving away.]
ARCHIVIST
Good. Right. (inhale) Ticket for one, then, I suppose.

[In the background, some sort of announcer is speaking:]
ANNOUNCER (B.G.)
Ladies and gentlemen, the performance is about to begin. Please take your seats.

[The audience applauds.]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
(over applause) The Tragedy of Francis: A comic puppet show in all acts.

[The applause peters out.]
[NOTE: All “stage directions” and “dialog” shown in blockquotes below are “read” by the Archivist, as if he is holding a copy of a script. Francis, the Spider, and the play’s other “characters” all speak only through his narration. Sound effects in brackets like this – including audience laughter and applause – are actual audible sound effects.]
Act Forty-Eight Thousand and Sixty-Seven:

A stage that is a room that remains a stage. The audience watches, drooling, expectant.

A table stands in the middle with a single chair. On that table can be seen a bottle, cigarettes, paraphernalia of all shapes, sizes, and consumptions.

From the space above the stage hang the hooks. They shift, gently, without the breeze, –

[Creaks.]
– as eager and hungry as the patrons in the seats.

Enter FRANCIS, stage left. They walk slowly, unsteadily. Every limb is shaking.

FRANCIS, softly: “Please. Please god, not again. I don’t want it to happen again.”

[Laughter from the audience, bright and in our faces this time. It sounds almost canned, like you would hear on a sitcom.]
Pause for laughter.

THE SPIDER, offstage: “Then walk away, Francis, just turn and leave. All that is required is a little bit of willpower.”

[The creaking continues, seemingly depicting something, though it’s not quite clear what yet.]
“You have a little bit of willpower, don’t you?”

FRANCIS begins to cry. They turn back towards the wings, keen to make their exit, but where they stood a moment before, there is now a dangling hook.

It lunges at FRANCIS, digging into their leg, pushing through the flesh of their thigh. There is a thin trickle of blood.

There is a thick shot of pain.

FRANCIS’S FATHER, offstage: “Useless piece of shit. You need to grow up!”

[That same audience laughter.]
Pause for laughter.

[The laughter grows louder this time, even culminating in a few claps. The audience really enjoyed that one.]
The hook lifts FRANCIS’s leg off the ground. They hop painfully, trying to escape, but the thread pulls tight, dragging them towards the table.

THE SPIDER, offstage: “What a funny little dance, Francis. Such a funny dance.”

FRANCIS simply screams in response. It is a scream of anger as much as it is of pain, and it cannot hide the dreadful inevitability they feel. The dull terror that this act will end like all the others.

In their thrashing jig they stumble into another hanging hook.

[We hear said hook hit Francis’s flesh with a thwip!]
[From now on, whenever the hooks are directed to do something in the play, we hear them do it as well.]
It burrows into their wrist with a noise of triumph.

FRANCIS’S MOTHER, offstage: “I just worry about you, dear; that’s all. We want what’s best for you, even if you can’t see it. I’m sure you’ll grow out of it.”

Between the two silk strings, FRANCIS dangles, eyes darting wildly about.

FRANCIS: “Why are you doing this?”

THE SPIDER’s giggle echoes around the stage.

[Audience laughter.]
Pause for laughter.

THE SPIDER twists the string, alternating which of the two lines is taut, causing FRANCIS to whirl and pivot towards the table.

Its bulbous, distended abdomen can now begin to be seen protruding from above the curtains that fringe the stage.

FRANCIS goes limp, briefly allowing THE SPIDER to guide their movements smoothly.

THE SPIDER: “Good, Francis. Good.”

Without warning, FRANCIS kicks their free leg against the table. It does not move. It is part of the tableau.

The force of the motion sends them staggering backwards; another hook brushes their cheek and takes its chance, ripping through the corner of their mouth and pulling it up into a grimace.

RYAN, a friend, offstage: “You never smile when you’re clean, did you know that? I mean, what have you got to be so sad about? Honestly. You do make it hard sometimes. I don’t know.”

FRANCIS tries to respond, but the hook in their mouth pulls tight, and their lips curve upwards, distorting the words.

FRANCIS: “Shut up!”

[Audience laughter.]
Pause for laughter.

FRANCIS tries to use their free hand to pull the razored metal barb from their mouth, but THE SPIDER reaches down a leg and pulls, hoisting its victim up by their face.

The agonizing motion is too sudden to even give them time to scream, and their free leg kicks out, impotently into the air. It hits against another hook, which penetrates their worn and weary boots with ease, digging up through the sole and out through the back of the ankle.

CHRISTIE, a lover, offstage: “Come on…! Helps me get in the mood, you know? Just a nice thing to do together. Makes me feel close to you.”

As it lowers them back to the ground, FRANCIS tries again to curse at THE SPIDER. To tell it it has no right to these voices, to leave all of them out of this.

But the pain of the hooks travels up and down their veins in thin lines of needling torment and robs them of their voice.

THE SPIDER leans closer. Its grinning face and quivering mandibles can now be seen; its abdomen throbs with anticipation.

THE SPIDER: “Oh, but I did not bring them. I did not write their lines in your little farce. You are the one that brought them. You devised the steps of this dance; I am simply here to… help you through them, when you forget.” (beat) “Oh, watch out!”

THE SPIDER pulls abruptly on the threads hooked into FRANCIS’s legs, and they tumble forward, faceplanting in a nasty-looking pratfall.

[Audience laughter.]
Pause for laughter.

FRANCIS’s free hand hits at the wooden floor of the stage weakly. It is unclear whether they hope to achieve something or if it is just an expression of despair.

The hook in their cheek pulls tight enough to form a grim smile of sorts.

FRANCIS: “What do you want?”

THE SPIDER: “The same thing I always want, Francis, every time we do this dance, every single act of our – hilarious production. I want what you want, deep, deep down in the hidden bit of you you’ve tried so hard to kill. You can’t wait for the dance to conclude.”

FRANCIS: “I don’t want that anymore. It’s different now; I’m different now. I’ve worked so hard.”

THE SPIDER: “I don’t care.”

The strings all go taut at once, yanking the weakly protesting Francis to their feet.

[The sweet strains of a music box kick in.]
They are dragged, back and forth and around in a series of clumsy motions that, in another time, in another place, might have been a waltz.

But a waltz has a partner. FRANCIS only has a desire, an itch in their bones that flows into them, drip by oily drip, down the glistening strands that suspend them, guide them, hold them. A desire which injects itself through razor-sharp hooks and pools inside their stomach.

They don’t want to want it, but…

[Audience laughter.]
Pause for laughter.

[The music box music ends.]
THE SPIDER: “A fine dance, Francis; that last measure I barely plucked the strings. Now come. Sit down. It’s time for a break. I know how much you’ve been looking forward to it.”

[A creaking twist of the hooks.]
THE SPIDER is almost fully descended now; its bulk eclipses everything above FRANCIS’s head and it swells with joy and amusement.

FRANCIS: “Please. Let me go. Just let me go.”

THE SPIDER: “Oh, Francis. It’s such a shame that I couldn’t do such a thing even if I wanted to. The man in the audience saw to that. (laugh) I am no more free than you are, little puppet. Ah! If only you could see the strings that bind me, that wind together as they pull me along my own path. Perhaps then you would not blame me so. But they are not the tripping threads we are here to watch, no. So sit, Francis. It’s time.”

Another tug of the hooks stretches the skin as FRANCIS staggers towards the table.

The blood flows faster, so dark it is almost black. Their chest rises and falls rapidly as they are lowered into the only seat, the dusty air of the theater scratching their throat and drying their mouth. There is the taste of tin, growing stronger.

The hits are all arranged before them, spread across the table in a cornucopia of promised oblivions, releases, and delights. FRANCIS feels the hooks tighten as they look upon the offering.

That deepest want bubbles up to the surface, but at its core there is still that mute fear, that anticipation of what surrender will bring.

There is no escape to be found here, no respite from the charade that is now found to be the sum of FRANCIS’s existence. By now, FRANCIS knows with utter clarity what falling to the call will bring, the awful crawling fate that they will endure before the next act eventually begins.

The syringe vibrates, almost imperceptibly, as the dark mass of legs and tiny, glittering eyes that sit within it shifts in anticipation. The cork of the bottle moves ever so slightly proud of the top, pushed by the unfurling thing inside. The cigarette scuttles closer, inch by impatient inch. Their longing is awful. And mutual.

Pause.

FRANCIS: “I don’t want it. Any of it.”

THE SPIDER does not reply.

Staring over the table, a memory now tugs at FRANCIS, the faintest residue of an earlier time, when the things before them would have brought a genuine joy to their heart and even a temporary peace. A time when the hunger was sharp and real, not this dull, unending ache that does nothing but propel them towards one grotesque act of consumption after another, but –

For all their keen awareness of what it might mean to do so, FRANCIS cannot deny the want THE SPIDER has gifted them.

They resist. They sit oh-so-very still and keep their hands held tight to their chest.

FRANCIS: “No. Not this time. I won’t.”

[Audience laughter.]
Pause for laughter.

FRANCIS looks up at THE SPIDER, so close now the thick drippings of its jaws fall onto their shoulders in a sticky stream. It says nothing, but a hook leaps from the darkness backstage, fastening itself into the soft skin at the back of FRANCIS’s free hand.

FRANCIS, offstage: “You don’t get it, like – it’s my decision. I know what I’m doing; just – can we stop talking about it, please? It’s fine, i-it just. Helps. It helps.”

FRANCIS’s whole body shudders at the sound of their own voice, as the hook pulls their arm forward, across the table.

FRANCIS: “No. No!”

Their hand closes on the bottle, which shifts and chitters with delight as FRANCIS, shaking, brings it close.

THE SPIDER’s legs twitch and jerk as it shifts the doomed marionette’s strings. FRANCIS watches as their hand gently uncorks the bottle, and the first of the tiny crawling spiders begins to emerge – just as their mouth is yanked open by its hook and their arm upends the bottle.

As FRANCIS feels the cascade crawl down their tongue and over their throat, they wonder just for a moment, whether this is better or worse than when they scuttle up into their veins, or down into their lungs.

It is an impossible question, and quite, quite pointless.

Above them, their tormentor cries out in exaltation as its abdomen ruptures, and the spiders within are joined by a rain of countless, tiny legs from above, covering them, embracing them. Drowning them.

There is no unconsciousness here, no calm detachment or serene buzz. There is only – the arachnids. Biting. Scurrying. Consuming.

And so it will be until the curtain descends at last and THE SPIDER resets the scene, its belly already beginning to swell once again with replacements for the creatures it so gorily birthed.

[Audience laughter.]
Pause for laughter.

[The audience begins to applaud, with real energy this time – this is performance-ending applause, final encore applause, though still definitely in the range of ‘polite’ and not raucous.]
And so the curtain descends.

[The audience continues applauding. Some members are cheering.]
The Tragedy of Francis: A comic puppet show in all acts.

[The audience quiets. Static begins to kick in.]
Act Forty-Eight Thousand and Sixty-Eight –

[There’s a sort of voice in the background. It sounds kind of like:]
MARTIN (B.G.)
(very faded, almost underwater) John?

– A stage that is a room that remains a stage.

MARTIN (B.G.)
One is enough.

[But the Archivist keeps going.]
– The audience –

[Martin slaps him.]
ARCHIVIST
(wh?) I – Oh – Wh, What?

MARTIN
(breathing heavy) Sorry. You were starting another, and I didn’t want to wait. We should get going.

ARCHIVIST
You – You were listening, I – I, I, I thought that –

MARTIN
No, I – Not for most of it. I just thought I heard – something. Whatever. I went exploring, alright? I don’t know why; I shouldn’t have.

ARCHIVIST
No, y,you shouldn’t have!

MARTIN
You know how many stages there are in this place, how many – little theatres?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Yes I do.

MARTIN
Right, stupid question.

ARCHIVIST
Martin…

MARTIN
Well, let’s just say they have a full bill, alright?

[In the background, an announcer repeats the show-starting announcement from earlier.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin.

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
Why did you go looking?

MARTIN
(fast) Can we just go, please?

ARCHIVIST
Of course. But… you were safe here. And after everything that’s already happened, I – I, I just don’t understand why you would…

MARTIN
(sudden burst) Me neither, okay!

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
(emotional) I mean, that’s it, isn’t it? I don’t know! I don’t know why I went exploring.

ARCHIVIST
(carefully) Are you saying you were… compelled?

MARTIN
I’m saying I don’t know, do I? (slight movement) I thought I was just curious; it felt like curiosity, but – given where we are, and with the Web everywhere, and Annabelle Cane still out there playing mind games with payphones, I just – (slight exhale) I mean, how d’you even know if it’s your motivation, you know? Being here – (sigh) I-It just makes me second-guess all of it, and I – I don’t like it, it – really scares me.

ARCHIVIST
I, uh…

MARTIN
Oh, don’t say that’s what it wants; I know.

ARCHIVIST
I – I wasn’t going to.

[Beat.]
[In the background, the announcer starts up again.]
MARTIN
Okay. Right.

ARCHIVIST
I was going to suggest that I could… maybe… Know. I could look. Just a quick peek, to, to see if it was just curiosity or – something else. (beat) Well?

MARTIN
I don’t –

[He breaks off, tries again:]
MARTIN
If you look, and I was – influenced, then how can I trust anything else? How can I believe any of my thoughts and feelings are really mine?

ARCHIVIST
(struggles a bit) Uh – Well – I, I’ll still be here to check. I’m not leaving you.

MARTIN
Sure, but you’d be looking through the details of everything that ever crosses my mind? I don’t want that – y,you know I don’t want that.

ARCHIVIST
I know.

[Pause. Some clothing sounds, movement.]
ARCHIVIST
Don’t do this to yourself, Martin. This is what it wants, the, the paranoia. (inhale) Trust me, I, I know.

MARTIN
Fair.

[A silence.]
MARTIN
(exhale) John, what does the Web want? It’s – I mean, we know it’s got a plan; can’t you just – see what it is?

[The Archivist sighs the sigh of someone who’s got to try and explain something to which they already know the answer’s not satisfactory.]
ARCHIVIST
Knowing… Seeing… i,it’s not the same thing as… understanding. Every time I try to know what the Web’s plan is, if it can even be called a plan, I see a hundred thousand events and causes and links, an impossibly intricate – (announcer starts up again) – pattern of consequences and subtle nudges, but I, I can’t – I can’t hold them all in my head at the same time.

There’s no way to see the whole, the, the point of it all. I can see all the details, but it doesn’t – provide – context or – (small sigh) Intention.

I suppose the Web doesn’t work in Knowledge, not in the same way.

MARTIN
Oh. Right.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

[Movement.]
MARTIN
And Annabelle?

ARCHIVIST
Still can’t see her. If it wasn’t for the phone call – (sigh) – I’d have said she was probably already dead.

MARTIN
(sigh) Yeah.

[Beat.]
ARCHIVIST
So… (inhale) Do you want me to? To tell you, if…?

MARTIN
No. (small sigh) No, I’ll just have to live with it, I guess. Hardly the worst thing I’ll have gone through since – (cutting himself off) I – um. It’s fine.

[Heavy exhale.]
ARCHIVIST
Would you like to leave now?

[A bit of the bags jingle.]
[The audience laughter surges in the background.]
MARTIN
(…decisive) Yeah, screw this place. Never liked the theatre anyway.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. A seemingly normal suburb… with no working streetlights]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Light footsteps, along with jangling of the bags.]
MARTIN
Slow down, I can barely see a thing!

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

[A bird-call-like sound in the background. It repeats as Martin speaks.]
MARTIN
(surprisingly chipper) No prizes for guessing who’s in charge here, eh?

ARCHIVIST
Mm, I – I suppose not.

MARTIN
You know, I really miss the days when I could blame broken streetlights on the council.

A strongly-worded letter just doesn’t feel as forceful when it’s addressed to (funny voice, pitched lower) whichever Dread Power it may concern.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Mm.

MARTIN
John?

ARCHIVIST
(zoned out) Hm?

MARTIN
(concerned) John, are you alright?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, I – I –

MARTIN
(overlapping) I mean, like, comparatively.

[Slight pause. A different bird screeches in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
(not fine) I’m fine.

MARTIN
Nope. Try again!

ARCHIVIST
Look, I would just really like to get through here as quickly as possible.

MARTIN
How come? This one seems like the quietest place we’ve been in a while – it’s just rows and rows of quiet houses. I mean, I know some people don’t like that sort of thing, but – (slight laugh) – I’m actually finding it kind of relax–

[The Archivist stops walking, his bag(s) jangling to a stop.]
ARCHIVIST
(cutting him off) Martin. Please.

[All of a sudden, it’s apparent he’s breathing heavily.]
MARTIN
…John? Where are we?

ARCHIVIST
I-It’s complicated.

MARTIN
That’s – not an answer!

ARCHIVIST
Can we please just move on?

[In the distance, there is a long, shrill scream. It sounds like it’s coming from a little girl.]
MARTIN
John, where have you brought us?

[Pause.]
[Then the Archivist shifts.]
ARCHIVIST
What do you think happened to all the children when the world changed? Or were you not thinking about it?

MARTIN
(softly) No…

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Because they didn’t just vanish. Childish fears are… simplistic. Direct.

[As he’s speaking, Martin reacts and sighs to his words.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
The Eye prefers the more complex neuroses and disquiets of a fully developed mind. So the children are allowed to age – and they are placed into domains where their fears can… mature.

[Martin exhales.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Domains like this one.

MARTIN
Christ, that’s – that’s messed up!

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

[Beat.]
MARTIN
We’ve got to help them.

ARCHIVIST
How?

MARTIN
(getting agitated) I – I don’t know! I’m not the one who’s supposed to know everything, alright? There has to be something we can do!

[Another blood-curdling scream in the background.]
MARTIN
What’s happening to them?

ARCHIVIST
Do you really want to know that? Really? I’ve been trying very hard to keep this one bottled up.

[Martin sighs as he speaks.]
MARTIN
Wh, What about the Avatar? (gaining steam) I know you said it didn’t change anything, th-the domain would still exist, but at this point I don’t care, alright? Anyone who’s chosen to spend their apocalypse tormenting children – God, you need to end them. Now.

ARCHIVIST
It’s not that simple.

MARTIN
Seriously? Seriously?

[The Archivist lets out a heavy, belaboured sigh.]
ARCHIVIST
Fine.

[The bags jingle as he starts walking.]
MARTIN
Okay, good.

[They keep walking.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Where are we going?

[The Archivist doesn’t answer.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
John?

[The Archivist is too busy ringing a doorbell.]
[The background noises of screeching things hang in the silence for a pause.]
[Then:]
MARTIN
John, wait – are you, are you sure? –

[The door opens.]
CALLUM BRODIE
Yeah? What is it?

[This is clearly a child. His voice has a tinge of what do you want to it, like he owns the place and doesn’t particularly like you.]
ARCHIVIST
Callum Brodie.

CALLUM
(hmph) Yeah?

MARTIN
Wait, is this – ?

ARCHIVIST
Are your parents home?

CALLUM
Dad’s dead. Mum’s here, but she lost it a while back. So now it’s just me.

ARCHIVIST
Do you know who I am?

CALLUM
…You’re the Eye guy, right?

ARCHIVIST
That’s right.

CALLUM
So you’re like, real important.

ARCHIVIST
(amused exhale) I suppose I am.

CALLUM
(unimpressed) Okay. So. What do you want?

MARTIN
John, can I have a word?

ARCHIVIST
Sure. Excuse me, Callum.

[Movement as he and Martin step aside to talk.]
MARTIN
(not really a question) That’s the Avatar for this place?

ARCHIVIST
Callum Brodie. Thirteen years old. He guides the children through their fears of the Dark.

MARTIN
This is that kid Basira went after last year, right? The one the darkness cult took. So, So that’s not even a kid, that’s whatever was inside Maxwell Rayner; it’s just wearing his body!

[The Archivist inhales.]
ARCHIVIST
(calling) Callum!

[Footsteps – either the Archivist towards Callum or Callum towards the Archivist.]
CALLUM
Yeah? What?

ARCHIVIST
You remember when those people kidnapped you? What happened?

CALLUM
(nonchalant) Mm – It was fine; I just hid and the cops came and got me.

ARCHIVIST
Tell the truth.

[His static rises. Callum makes a sound of – not exactly pain, but discomfort, whether physical or at the thought of having to be truthful.]
CALLUM
I-I-I was, I was scared, alright? I was really, really scared.

[The static fades.]
CALLUM (CONT’D)
And it was d-dark, and I couldn’t see anyone, and – I didn’t know where I was, and – and there, there was something on my face and – it was cold, and it was slimy. And it didn’t like me.

Then there was a bang, and it was gone. And – the police were there.

ARCHIVIST
And what happened to the thing that tried to take you over?

CALLUM
Don’t know, it – went away.

ARCHIVIST
It died in the light.

CALLUM
Whatever.

ARCHIVIST
And it was after that you started shoving smaller kids into cupboards, right?

CALLUM
Yeah, give them a taste of it. Make them afraid of the dark.

[It’s funny – when he says these last statements, it almost sounds like there’s the slightest of echoes, like his voice is layered. It gives a buzz to his words.]
ARCHIVIST
But you’ve always pushed around smaller children, haven’t you?

CALLUM
They make me feel sick. I hate them.

ARCHIVIST
And now?

CALLUM
Now everyone’s afraid of me.

[Pause.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin?

MARTIN
Fine, you’ve made your point.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you, Callum.

CALLUM
(disgusted sigh) Whatever.

ARCHIVIST
Isn’t it past your bedtime?

[Callum scoffs, and starts to close the door.]
CALLUM
I don’t have a bedtime anymore.

[He shuts the door.]
[Martin and the Archivist start walking.]
ARCHIVIST
You see?

[Martin, however, is still frustrated.]
MARTIN
See what, John; what am I supposed to see? That you don’t want to kill a – thirteen year old kid? Big revelation.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know what you want me to do.

MARTIN
I want you to use your power. I want you to help them; I want you to make things better!

ARCHIVIST
There is no better anymore.

MARTIN
(increasing in volume, emotion) You keep – saying that, and I hate it!

ARCHIVIST
(also giving in to the argument) I keep saying it because it keeps being true; you know that!

MARTIN
What I know, is that leaving children here is – (struggles for words) i-it’s inexcusable; it’s monstrous!

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping, firm) Martin. Tell me what you want me to do, and I will do it!

[Silence, but for the screams in the background.]
[Then:]
MARTIN
Tell me about this place. I need to know.

ARCHIVIST
I thought you hated listening. (inhale) Are you… sure that’s what you want?

MARTIN
Of course it’s not.

[A jangle as he sets his bag down.]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
But I need to hear it.

ARCHIVIST
Okay.

[An exhale. Static rising. And:]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
See Jack. See Jack run. Run, Jack. Run into the dark.

Don’t see Jack anymore.

Jack doesn’t want to be in the dark. Everyone knows there are monsters in the dark. Horrible monsters, with sharp teeth and red eyes and big nasty claws, that eat up little children who don’t run fast enough.

So why does Jack run into the dark? Is it because a grown-up told him to? No. Now that it’s dark, the grown-ups are asleep. They are snoring in their beds and will not wake up no matter how much Jack shouts.

Some grown-ups are not in bed, but they do not want to help Jack. They want to be alone. They don’t want any children around at all. They tell Jack it is after his bedtime, and put him in another dark room where he cannot run.

So no grown-ups told Jack to run into the dark.

Is it because he is brave enough to fight the monsters? No. Jack is scared all the time. The world is so big and the night is so long, and the monsters are waiting under the bed and in the closet and down the hallway and in the street and round the corner and behind him.

They cannot wait to eat him.

He wants to be somewhere the monsters can’t get him.

Jack is not brave. So why does Jack run into the dark?

Because everywhere is dark on Night Street. And if he doesn’t run, then the monsters will get him.

Jack has never seen a monster – of course he hasn’t; it’s too dark – but he is sure that they are there. See that shadow, behind the swings? It is twisty and twirly, and if he doesn’t jump over it, Jack is sure that it would cut off his feet and eat them.

See that tree, the one in the back garden? If Jack got too close, he is sure the bark will open like a big mouth and splinter teeth will bite off his hands to wear like apples.

You see that drum, the one from the old drying machine? There’s a big worm that lives underneath it, and Jack is sure that if he disturbs it, it will wrap around him like a big slimy snake and squeeze him until his eyes pop out.

So Jack keeps running. He keeps running through the dark. He runs through his big, dark house. He runs through his big, dark garden. He runs down the big, dark street that just goes round and round and round.

He runs until he sees another child. It’s Callum, from number 27. He’s big and brave and isn’t scared of monsters, though he knows ever so much about them. He smiles when he sees Jack. He is Jack’s friend.

For just a minute, Jack stops running. Callum smiles and says he’s found a brand new monster.

Jack doesn’t want to hear about it. He knows that when Callum tells him what it is, then it will start to chase him. He won’t see it, of course, because it is just too dark. But he will know it’s there.

Jack can’t tell Callum to be quiet, though. Last time he did that, Callum put him in a hole for a very long time, and the next hole would certainly be full of all of Callum’s nastiest monsters.

And anyway, Callum is Jack’s friend. And friends don’t tell each other to be quiet.

So Callum begins to tell Jack about a new monster. It lives down the drain and pops up through the plughole when you’re washing your hands and bites off all your fingers one by one. The only way to stop it is to shine a torch down the hole.

But there are no torches on Night Street. There are no lights at all. No way to check a drain or a shadow or a tree. Only monsters. And the dark.

So Jack begins to run.

See Kaitlyn. See Kaitlyn hide. See Kaitlyn hide in the dark, because everywhere is dark on Night Street.

This time, Kaitlyn is in her wardrobe. The door is closed all but a crack so she can see into her bedroom. But the night light is out, and the room is pitch black, and she can hear the monsters moving about.

They are looking for her. They snuffle and grunt and growl. They knock over her lamp and gut her cuddly toys and talk to each other of whether they want to cook Kaitlyn into a stew or barbecue her arms and legs.

Kaitlyn buries her face in her mother’s old fur coat and she cries and she cries. Her mother is downstairs, but she is part of the sofa now. She won’t stop staring at the television and laughing. Laughing and laughing.

She doesn’t like it when Kaitlyn is awake. She doesn’t hear it if she screams.

The monsters are getting closer. They have looked for her under the bed. They have looked through her chest of drawers. They have climbed up all the bookshelves, and now they are moving towards the wardrobe.

She cannot see them, but their voices are sharp and mean and they come closer and closer and Kaitlyn is ever-so-scared.

Kaitlyn read a picture book once, full of horrible spiky fish with big eyes and crooked teeth. She would see them every time she went to bed for weeks.

That was what the monsters looked like, she was sure of it. They would grip her with their nasty cold fins and bite her head clean off.

Kaitlyn could not hide for long. It was very dark. But their big eyes would see her in no time.

She was curled up in the corner of the wardrobe against a huge pile of scarves.

Wait. There’s someone behind the pile! Kaitlyn can barely see, but it looks like – Callum Brodie! What is he doing in her wardrobe?

Kaitlyn doesn’t like Callum Brodie. He punches her in the arm sometimes and calls her a baby, and he’s always told her the monsters were going to get her. He was a bully.

“Go away, Callum Brodie,” Kaitlyn says. “I’m trying to hide.”

Callum Brodie just smiles a big grin full of crooked teeth.

“She’s in here!” Callum Brodie shouts, loud enough for the whole street to hear. Kaitlyn can hear the monsters coming towards the wardrobe. She pushes Callum Brodie back and opens the door.

It is so dark outside that she can’t see anything at all, but she runs and she runs and she runs, looking for another place to hide.

See Kaitlyn hide.

[Something creaks in the background – not the typical wooden creak, but like a door that won’t close properly squeaking in the wind.]
[Static rushes in, then fades.]
[When the Archivist speaks, it’s got a snap to it.]
ARCHIVIST
Is that enough for you? Do you need to hear more?

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
See Luka. See Luka sleep –

MARTIN
(cutting in) No, no, no; that’s enough!

[A jangling as he – reaches over?]
MARTIN (CONT’D)
That’s enough.

[Pause.]
[A few steps.]
[Then, clothing sounds as the Archivist speaks:]
ARCHIVIST
Thank you for not hitting me this time.

[A pause that stretches on for the span of three heavy breaths.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Was that what you wanted? What you needed?

[Beat.]
MARTIN
No, it didn’t help at all.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

[Another pause.]
MARTIN
Let’s get out of here.

ARCHIVIST
If you’re sure.

MARTIN
The sooner we get back to the Archives, the sooner we can put a stop to this. All of this. They just – (inhale) They’ll just need to hang on a little longer.

ARCHIVIST
Right. (exhale) Right.

MARTIN
Come on.

[They start walking.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. VAST DOMAIN]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[There is a great howling in the background. A great gale of wind, shrieking its way towards us, punctuated every now and then with a thunderous boom. It’s still distant. For now.]
[The Archivist’s static fades quickly in, and:]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The shadow falls over everything Mehreen has ever known.

When it had first covered her home, bathing the street beyond the window in unexpected shade, she had thought it an eclipse. There wasn’t supposed to be one then, she is sure of that, although, if pressed, she could not have told you what day it is today.

Before the shadow fell, she is sure that the sun was shining brightly, although, if pressed, she could not have pictured it.

And the humid heat of a lingering summer had left the world sleepy and unprepared, although, if pressed, she remembers the heat but not the season.

All told, the time before the sky was covered is hazy to her, but she knows there was one: A time before something blocked out the Sun.

It moves in shifts as if it is willed, clearly some part of a greater whole. A foot? A hand? Perhaps a single finger. To look up is to see only the smallest fraction of it covering the sky, and half of Mehreen’s mind screams at her to get back, to get further away, to get to a distance where perhaps she could see the whole of it. A position where the idea of comprehending what she is looking at isn’t some – bitter joke.

But the other half of her mind whispers the truth: That it is already so far away that to see it in its entirety is impossible. And if she did, she could not understand it.

[A boom, slightly closer than before. They’re beginning to take on a science-fiction-esque air; there’s a bit of synth or scattering in the boom, now.]
But there is another certainty within her, another piece of terrible knowledge that bubbles up unbidden from somewhere in Mehreen’s soul that is no longer hers: It is coming closer.

It is descending on her home and everything that she has ever known. And when it arrives, it will not even notice that it has destroyed her. That it has so casually wiped from the world everything that she will ever know or love.

It will crush her home. It will crush her family and her city and her world. The shadow is over everything.

Mehreen gathers her mother, who sits in the kitchen over a pot of sour-smelling tea, berating her that they should have left earlier. She gathers her husband, who snorts in derision and tells her that he’s heard that there isn’t really any danger at all. She gathers her daughter, who asks with wide eyes and the voice of nervous innocence where they are going. What’s going on?

Mehreen cannot quite make out their faces as she bundles them into the car, old and shuddering as it coughs into life. Does she remember having a child? A spouse? Does she remember her mother having such a cruel sneer?

It doesn’t matter. They are here now, and she has to save them. She cannot leave them to the growing shadow and the thing coming ever-closer.

[Boom.]
She starts to drive. The streets are empty, the blank-faced strangers around them frozen, staring into the sky in still and silent expectation.

There is no traffic, nothing to stop the laboured grinding of the elderly car as it careens down the street, hunting desperately for the edge of the shadow.

Mehreen knows if she can just escape it, find where it ends and the sunlight hits the earth, they can be free. They will not be beneath it when the vast being arrives.

But there is no hope in her for it, no glimmer of optimism as they hurtle down street after street. Only the crushing dread, the leaden knowledge that they started too late, that they’re not fast enough, that the shadow reaches a thousand miles in every direction, and they could drive for a month.

Have they been driving that long? How many miles have they traveled now? And still they would never get away, never cross that line from below the shadow into open, sunlit air.

[Boom.]
The world gets darker, and the thing moves closer. It will be upon them any moment now. The car grinds and crunches somewhere in its engine and rolls to a stop.

Mehreen grabs her daughter, now crying with fear and confusion, and begins to run.

Where is she running to? It will be upon them all soon, wiping out everything they were or are or will be, rendering their lives an unremembered blip, crushed beneath its unstoppable significance.

It is right above them, and it will. Not. Stop.

How long has she been running? Minutes? Days? Her unfamiliar daughter laughs cruelly, carried in Mehreen’s exhausted arms. They cannot escape the shadow as their doom gets forever closer.

Far, infinitely far above her, Edward holds his grip tight. His fingers are white with strain, and his own arms burn and ache deeper than he thought possible.

He is interlocked, woven into an unending tapestry of suffering, contorted bodies. The shape that they create is a mystery to him, but as it moves he can feel his own muscles twist and stretch with those he holds onto, together shifting and pulling and lifting the bulk of the thing of which he is only the tiniest part.

Where the impulses come from, he does not know, traveling through the impossible colossus, rippling down through the people that form its bulk. Moving as one.

He does not know where in the thing he is, but suspects that it is not too far from the edge, for sometimes he can see something he might almost believe to be sky.

Some part of it hits the ground, –

[Boom. Much closer than before.]
– however distantly below him that may be.

[The wind is shrieking up here – we are in the midst of it, as compared to Mehreen.]
A foot, perhaps, or a limb of some sort.

[And it is at this point that it becomes clear that those booms we’re hearing? They’re this great beast’s “footsteps.”]
The shuddering impact of it resonates up through the bodies that surround him, and all at once they cry out in pain. He can hear  bones snap and tendons rip as the force of the step sharply shifts the twisted arrangement of human misery.

Edward’s own neck is spun, pushed by the shoulder of the woman crushed in behind him, and turned so far to the side that he is sure another millimeter – and it would break entirely.

For hours he holds that position, dreading every moment that the next motion of the thing they construct will break him like thin porcelain.

And then it comes: Not another stepping impact, for those are rare and ponderous, but the agonized pull of the whole trying to lift itself. Every muscle in every body tenses all at once, and Edward finds himself moving, pushed and squeezed and gasping for space and – free.

Without warning, he finds himself in open air, forced out of the thing like a shoot pushing up through the soil. He takes in a deep breath, his protesting limbs now limp and almost useless, and collapses upon a ground that looks up at him in envy.

No. Not a ground. For it is only now that Edward realizes how thin the air is, how cold it is without the warmth of uncountable bodies on all sides.

Behind him he can see the shifting sea of people stretching out forever, but in front of him, a few hundred meters away, there is what appears to be… an edge.

In a place where time has meaning it might be said it takes Edward hours, days to drag himself over the writhing floor. But eventually he finds himself laying upon that horizon, willing himself to look out, over, and down, see where he is. If there is any place to which he might escape.

So finally, he looks.

[The howling begins to build up again, up into:]
[Boom.]
[The wind keeps whipping around as Edward looks.]
His stomach drops, and his arms seize as he looks upon a hundred miles of slowly-moving humanity down to a stark and barren ground far below. It is so far down that if he climbed for a year he would not reach the end of it.

His tears fall down and away into the open sky. His teeth lock in fear and he begins to try and move backwards, away from the precipice.

But there is a movement. A shift in the people below him as the great beast stretches a part of itself.

A wave of spasming limbs passes beneath Edward, and in a moment he is flung, upwards and away, out into the empty air below.

He is falling. He cannot breathe as the air is forced from his lungs and the razor-cold wind lashes at his skin.

He is falling. The beast he was once a part of is a blur beside him as he plummets, human forms lost in the strange, moving texture.

He is falling, and he is so small and so afraid he wonders if he will ever hit the ground.

He does not want to die smeared over that flat and hateful wasteland far below, and he flails, limbs throwing themselves violently around, trying to catch a hold of something, anything to save himself.

Edward feels a hand grip his. The stop is sudden, violent, wrenching his shoulder from its socket with a wet pop. He screams in pain but also in relief as he hangs there, suspended above his fate.

Despite his dread, it takes only a moment for him to make his decision. He reaches out with his other arm and feels it gripped by another hand as slowly, inexorably, he allows himself to be pulled back into the great, suffering colossus.

Far below, there is another impact –

[Boom.]
[The wind howls. It almost sounds like crying.]
As if something were being stepped on.

[His static creeps back in, just enough to:]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. VAST DOMAIN]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[A sigh.]
MARTIN
Is it much further?

[The Archivist gives a little heh of an amused exhale, and there’s a grin to his voice when he responds.]
ARCHIVIST
Yes.

[Martin sighs, a bit over-dramatically.]
ARCHIVIST
(still amused) I’m not entirely sure what you were expecting; it’s the Vast. The clue is in the name.

MARTIN
(long-suffering) Yes, alright.

ARCHIVIST
Just be glad that this is one of the domains that actually has ground to walk on.

MARTIN
Whatever.

[Another boom-step.]
MARTIN
S-So how far are we from the other side? And – And don’t say time and space don’t work here; that’s a cop-out and you know it.

[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Fine. Three days.

MARTIN
(immediate) Thank you!

[A brief lull as they keep walking.]
[And then it hits:]
MARTIN
Wait. Wait, what counts as a day?

ARCHIVIST
(audibly trying not to laugh *too* hard) What an excellent question.

MARTIN
(under breath) Oh my god – (to the Archivist) You can be infuriating sometimes, you know that?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
Fine! Fine. How about Simon; how close are we to him?

ARCHIVIST
Um… Close, but he’s able to move a lot faster than we are in this place.

MARTIN
Meaning…?

ARCHIVIST
Meaning I know where he is, but – if he doesn’t want us to reach him, I don’t know if we’ll have much of a chance.

MARTIN
So – So, what, we’re just going to trust him to show up to his own execution –

[He is cut off by the man of the hour himself falling from the sky in what sounds like right in front of them.]
[Both he and the Archivist give a short yell of surprise.]
MARTIN
Jesus!

[A short laugh, and:]
ARCHIVIST
(a bit in shock, in response to Martin’s cut-off question) Uh… apparently!

SIMON FAIRCHILD
Hello!

[He makes a big show of brushing off the rubble or whatever else has gathered around him on impact.]
SIMON
Hello, dreadfully sorry!

[Just as before, he sounds like a stereotype – all proper and manners, in a delightfully overeager way. Somehow, though, it’s not affected – there’s definite mirth there, too.]
[He continues to brush off the debris, recovering his breath as he does so.]
SIMON
I only just noticed you were both here! That’s the problem with having such a big place, you know – you can miss things if you’re not careful.

ARCHIVIST
Uh-h. Right.

SIMON
Good to see you again, Martin! And you must be the famous Archivist. Herald of the Ceaseless Watcher, Harbinger of the New Age, etcetera. Lovely to meet you at last. (exhale) Simon Fairchild, at your service.

ARCHIVIST
I know who you are.

SIMON
(with a laugh) Of course you do. I imagine you know pretty much everything by this point. How is it? How does it feel?

ARCHIVIST
Strange.

SIMON
Yes. I can imagine! These gifts can feel very disconcerting at times. I’m sure you’ll get used to it eventually.

And how are you, Martin? Still trying to save the world and all that?

MARTIN
Yes.

SIMON
Pity. Well, armageddon… (like it’s just occuring to him) it’s not for everyone, I suppose. I’m quite enjoying it, of course, although – Junior over there can be a little bit of a handful.

[In the background, “Junior” takes another step.]
MARTIN
(disgusted) I might have guessed you’d be happy living in this nightmare.

SIMON
I mean, not that it matters, but – yes I am! Honestly, I think you could be too, if you set your mind to it.

But I’m not one to tell you how to live your eternity.

MARTIN
No. You’re not. Because I’m done listening to you!

SIMON
I’m sorry? I’m not sure I follow.

MARTIN
All those lies you told me – you helped to do this; you turned the world into your, your – playground.

SIMON
Um, not to be a pedant, but if you recall, I was actually doing a favor for Peter. And if Peter had won, none of this would have happened. Also, not to make excuses, but they weren’t exactly lies. Just – oversimplifications of complicated truths.

And guesses. (brief pause) A lot of guesses. (brief pause) Almost all guesses, really, now I come to think about it.

MARTIN
Shut up! I don’t care.

SIMON
Goodness! We’re rather tetchy, aren’t we?

ARCHIVIST
We’ve… (slight laugh) not been having an easy journey.

MARTIN
John.

ARCHIVIST
What, it’s true; we haven’t.

SIMON
Well, in that case, thank you for swinging by to my – huge corner of the apocalypse. We don’t get many visitors these days, and, well – you might be the closest thing the universe has ever had to an important person.

ARCHIVIST
Oh – I… um…

SIMON
I mean, obviously you’re still ultimately finite and all that, but altering the very fabric of the universe, that’s… (*phew*) That’s pretty good going, all things considered.

MARTIN
(moving) That’s enough. John?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… yes?

MARTIN
Do it.

[The wind picks up.]
[Another boom-step.]
SIMON
Uhh… Do what?

MARTIN
Kill him.

ARCHIVIST
Uh –

[The Archivist splutters, exhales.]
SIMON
Hang on. Can he do that?

MARTIN
(forceful) He can, and he’s going to!

SIMON
Oh! (processes) Right! Seems a bit rude, to be honest.

ARCHIVIST
(background, simultaneous) Oh, oh… okay, um.

MARTIN
John?

ARCHIVIST
J-Just give me a moment! I, uh, I –

SIMON
(simultaneous) I-In fact, yes! You know what? I’ll, I’ll probably just be going, then – I, I – I’d prefer to keep existing, if it’s all the same to you, uhm –

MARTIN
J-John!

ARCHIVIST
I –

SIMON
(fast) Been lovely chatting to you! Good to see you guys. Feel free to pop by again when you’re feeling less, um, murdery.

MARTIN
(yelling) John!

SIMON
Byeee!

[And with a whoosh, he’s gone.]
[Silence.]
[Then the Archivist sighs.]
MARTIN
You let him go.

ARCHIVIST
(weary) Yeah.

MARTIN
Why?

ARCHIVIST
Because, uh… uh –

MARTIN
(cutting him off) Why did you let him go, John?

ARCHIVIST
(sharper) I don’t know, I just – (sigh, easing off) I didn’t want to kill him.

MARTIN
(strangely calm) Why not? Because he was nice to you? Because he was charming, because he was fun?

ARCHIVIST
No, I-I, I just –

[A creakity-creak: Helen’s here! And with her is her signature shimmery static.]
[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
Not now, Helen!

HELEN
I just wanted to add my vote to the disappointed side.

MARTIN
Wait, really?

HELEN
I was rather looking forward to watching an old man metaphysically explode. Honestly, I feel a bit cheated. The others were exceptional fun.

[The Archivist sighs as she speaks.]
MARTIN
Wait, you were watching?

HELEN
Of course. As much fun as the new world is, I am not about to miss a real, honest-to-godless demigod murder spree!

[She laughs.]
[Martin sighs.]
MARTIN
Look, you’re really not helping.

HELEN
(cheerful) I’m not trying to!

ARCHIVIST
Look, it’s none of your business. Either of you.

MARTIN
Like hell it isn’t.

ARCHIVIST
Martin.

MARTIN
Don’t “Martin” me! Sure, he looks like a helpless old man, but –

ARCHIVIST
(cutting him off) I know, Martin; I know all the things he’s done.

HELEN
Fantastic! So, rip him up! Pop him! Oh, oh, but, um, just give me a bit of a heads-up so I can find a good spot

MARTIN
Enough, Helen.

HELEN
I won’t be in the way! He won’t even know I’m there. Again.

MARTIN
What is it, John? What’s wrong?

ARCHIVIST
I just – This whole… avenging angel thing, I, I’m not – (exhale) It doesn’t feel right.

MARTIN
It seemed to feel right when we were avenging all the wrongs done against you.

ARCHIVIST
I know. (stronger) I, I, I know, alright? But well – (exhale) That’s kind of the problem; I, I have all this – power, and, and I want to use it to try to help, but I – (under breath) I don’t know – (normal) I mean, I do. (getting emotional) I-I’ve done so much damage, and – and anything that might help to balance that is – (composing self) But killing other Avatars is, is not – I, I don’t think it makes anything better. I think it just makes me worse.

MARTIN
You’re removing evil from the world.

ARCHIVIST
I, I’m not though, am I? The tenement fire is still burning. The mortal garden is growing wild. The carousel –

HELEN
Oh!

[This effectively shuts the argument up.]
ARCHIVIST
What.

HELEN
How are we still having this intensely boring conversation? I honestly thought that actually ending the world would be enough to stop you whining, but no!

You’re the most powerful person in a world where the worst consequences imaginable have already happened! Absolute power, with zero responsibility!!

What more can you possibly need to just enjoy yourself a tiny bit?

[Junior punctuates her words with another step.]
[The Archivist and Martin don’t respond.]
HELEN
Fine! Guess I’ll just leave then! Hang out inside myself until you get angry again and accidentally have some fun.

ARCHIVIST
It’s not. Fun.

[Helen just laughs.]
HELEN
And here I thought you’d forgotten how to make jokes.

[Her door creaks as she leaves, then shuts.]
[The Archivist sighs.]
ARCHIVIST
I-I, I’m sorry, Martin. After meeting the child, I thought – I’d been – (sudden burst) I really hoped things would be simpler, you know? A nice straightforward apocalypse.

MARTIN
(also sighing) No, (exhale) I’m sorry. Cheerleading you when you’re on a magical murder spree probably wasn’t – a great idea.

ARCHIVIST
I started it.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
Good point! (small laugh) I’ll keep my apology, then.

[Movement and fabric sounds – a hug? Holding each other?]
[A small, happy hm and exhale from Martin.]
MARTIN
I do kinda wish you’d wait until after Fairchild to have your crisis, though.

ARCHIVIST
You really want that old man dead.

MARTIN
I mean, su– yeah, sure, when you say it like that it sounds bad.

ARCHIVIST
What did he do to you?

MARTIN
…He threatened to throw me off a rollercoaster.

ARCHIVIST
(amused, knowing) Ah.

MARTIN
Okay, I, I know it sounds like a joke, but –

ARCHIVIST
(straight-faced) No, obviously, he’s an avatar of the Vast, it’s a scary threat coming from him.

MARTIN
(exactly! so There) Yeah!

ARCHIVIST
It just – doesn’t – sound like a scary threat.

MARTIN
Thanks for that.

[Sudden movement.]
MARTIN
Hang on, you’re still down to kill Elias, right? Uh – Jonah. Whatever.

ARCHIVIST
I’m still going to confront him. I don’t know if it is something I’m even – capable of, but if I can and I have to, I will.

MARTIN
Yeah?

ARCHIVIST
Don’t worry. I won’t hesitate.

MARTIN
Right.

[The wind builds up again. Junior takes another step.]
MARTIN
(exhaling) Right, alright then. Good.

[He takes a step.]
MARTIN
Let’s go, then. We don’t want to keep him waiting.

ARCHIVIST
Lead on.

MARTIN
Uh – Wh, I –

ARCHIVIST
Oh, right, yes. Follow me, then.

[They start walking.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. A DOMAIN OF THE EXTINCTION]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[There’s a low, musical tone in the background. The constant movement of what sounds like metal or metal scraps, overlain with the buzzing of night insects.]
[Also in the background: a distant air raid siren. Multiple, actually, overlapping only at the edges, each setting off a higher pitch as the previous one ends.]
[A quick static in, and:]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Item: A stubborn lamp.

Approximately a foot and a half long, stand made of discoloured brass with a crude fleur-de-lis pattern and slightly melted at the base.

Shade constructed from satin, original colour impossible to discern due to assorted stains, likely blood, oil, and paraffin wax.

The bulb is imprinted with the words “Long Life” despite appearing to contain a standard tungsten filament. There is a long, thin crack that runs the length of the bulb, and it is remarkably easy to cut yourself on the thin glass.

With the vacuum compromised, it should be impossible for the light to turn on. The power cable is severed about three inches from the base of the stand and writhes like a beheaded snake.

There is nothing in this place to power it.

Despite all of this, a thin and sickly glow can be seen from underneath the lampshade, an irregular, pulsing light that casts rotten shadows on the piles of detritus and clusters of ash and bone that surround it.

Where its sputtering illumination falls, the color drains from everything, leaving nothing but a faded grey. It cannot survive, but still it clings to its existence, destroying everything around it.

It smells like death.

[Another light clattering of metal from the pile – is someone looking around?]
Leah’s fingers are worn and dry, their color painfully faded, save for a streak of scarlet that drip-drops from her cut fingers as she furiously scribbles her findings into the notebook. The pages tear with the frenzy of her writing as she desperately tries to keep her thoughts alive.

[More clattering.]
Fauna: A mouldering seagull.

Larger than any related specimen to be found before the Anthropocene age, this bird has been rendered flightless by the tightly woven plastic netting that winds around and around its torso, digging into the skin beneath the feathers and bulging over the strange lumps and tumors that cover it.

Its feathers have turned an oily black, and its vestigial eyes are pale and sightless, relying instead on the sounds its prey makes as they traverse the noisy junkpiles of discarded landscape.

Its beak has become hard and its edges are serrated, allowing it to tear apart the tin cans and hard plastics that shield its food with ease.

Its legs are long and many-jointed, allowing it to move across the uneven ground, and its throat is blocked with concrete, preventing it from crying and letting it move among the ruins in complete silence.

It nests in the rusted-out hollows of fleeing cars, constructing intricate shelters for its young out of corpse-hair and wiring. Its eggs are rusty, covered in slime, and its chicks are born with plastic rings around their necks.

They smell like ammonia and salt, and their name is meaningless, as there is no longer such a thing as the sea.

[Clatter.]
Leah hides behind a cracked vending machine, waiting for the thing to pass. She knows it can hear the rapid scratch of her broken pencil, but it is all she can do to get it down, get it all down on paper – another futile warning of a future that is already here.

Item: A history book.

Hardback. Eight-point-five by eleven inches and approximately an inch and a half thick, although the number of pages is impossible to discern.

Its dust jacket has long since been lost, and what remains is wrinkled maroon cloth over soggy book-board.

The faded letters of a partial title can be seen embossed into the spine. The words A Brief History of – can be made out clearly, but the rest has been burned away.

The spine is cracked and broken, but the volume itself cannot be opened. The book has clearly been submerged into some sort of fat or binding agent, and the paper within it has fused together into a single, indistinguishable lump of pulp.

The wet mass within it retains sufficient moisture that if the covers are pressed upon, a thin rivulet of clear liquid will run like tears down the book’s cover.

If you do this, the book will scream.

[It is at this point you notice the cacophony in the background: a strange hissing, the wretched cries of their modern seagull, and another, more indistinguishable sound. Perhaps it is the book.]
It is a stupid thing, a long-dead trinket that was of no use to anyone even when it puffed itself up with the factuous intellectual dribblings of those who believed the past was any defense against the future, bloated as it was with the hagiographies of war criminals and smugly grinning murderers.

Now it serves as a suffering reminder of everything that has been lost – which is to say, nothing of value.

Leah hates the book. She cannot shake the feeling that once, long ago, she read it, seeing within its pages the stark importance of taking action, of trying to change the world for the better and avoiding the dead, nightmare future that kept her awake at night.

But it was doomed from the start, and those who salivated at the thought of a place in history had secured nothing but its end.

[More crumbling, more squeaking.]
Item: A laughable umbrella.

Look at it. What does it think it’s doing here? Lying there, broken, skeletal. There hasn’t been rain in fifty years. The soil is cracked and parched. Any vegetation that claws its agonized way up out of it maggot-white and dry as dust.

The only moisture is from the wet rot of the junkpiles that stretch thirty feet above the ground in all directions, spilling out into the sandy, sloping basin that was once a sea bed.

Stupid umbrella. Does it think there is a monsoon coming? Does it even remember what a cloud of water vapor looks like?

The clouds that pass now are oily and stink of sulfur, waiting for you to stop paying attention before they climb down your throat and settle in your lungs.

Perhaps this idiot apparatus thinks it can protect from the relentless heat of the sun, but its fabric is torn and ruined, hanging from the snapped metal limbs, desperate for a breeze to stir it from its – complete stillness.

Take a moment to sneer at this corpse of an umbrella, and wish for a moment you had water enough within you to spit on it.

Leah can barely tell what she’s writing anymore. The catalog of horrors she’s compiling, this report on everything for nobody, but what else is she to do? What else can even come close to quelling the fear that suffuses her existence?

Fauna: The thing that lives.

Something lives in the Anthropocene age. Not a twisted reflection of the world, not a parasite or a scavenger or a cockroach, but a native.

Something born in the sloping shells of sagging concrete towers, that tastes the tang of rusted iron in the air and knows that it is home.

Something that does not know or care what a human is, any more than mankind thought of the creatures that once lived in the shells they found on the beach.

It moves through the stacks of garbage like a beetle through filth, and its smile is all-too familiar, though its eyes are dark and empty.

It cannot be seen in its entirety, for it keeps itself covered, but its long, unfurling tongue may be seen emerging, pink and bristling with long, hairlike taste buds, hunting for something old enough to eat.

It whispers to itself in the dark, and sounds like old snippets of toothpaste commercials and adverts to join the army.

[A strange, low moaning sound – but layered as if through a filter, as if through one of those plastic microphones that layer your voice until your voice sounds alien and you’re not quite sure how many of you there were to start with.]
It is hard to tell if there is more than one, but either there are several of them of different sizes, or there is just the one, and it is getting bigger.

It is our replacement, and it is welcome to the world.

Even if Leah had known, if she had had time to warn them, who would have believed her? Who would not have laughed her out of her life if she described the horrors that were to come in their true and vivid detail?

[Another multiphonic groan. Is it getting closer?]
But there is no one left to warn, though that does not slow her hand even a moment. She ignores the burning pain in her forearm, where the thing’s rough tongue has torn a section of her skin clean off.

[More groans, one after the other. Is there more than one? Are they calling out to each other?]
Item: A forgotten bone.

…Whose is this? Pale white and stained with thick black tar.

A human bone, that much is clear; too big to be a child’s, at least. Can a bone seem familiar? The shape of it echoing through your mind, like a face seen only in dreams?

It may be followed up to a ribcage, still sticky in places with soapy cadaver fat, and closing around a crumpled beer can where the heart should be.

There’s a skull as well, yellowing in the thick dust of the open air.

Strange. Everything here is either bone-dry from relentless heat, or damp through from decomposition and stagnant decay. Lifeless yet decaying. The world we have left behind.

Leah considers the bones for some time.

Does she know them? Are they hers? If she had been quicker, more forceful in her warnings, might they still be alive?

Her pencil is broken, but her notes, her warnings from this new world are far from complete.

She snaps off another rib and continues writing.

[Static increasing.]
[A soft sigh from the Archivist.]
ARCHIVIST
Right.

[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. A DOMAIN OF THE EXTINCTION]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[Crunching of footsteps, with the occasional clatter of glass or metal from the junkpiles.]
MARTIN
You know what? I am sitting down.

ARCHIVIST
Are… you sure? That thing is… that’s not in great shape.

MARTIN
(don’t care! nothing matters!) Neither am I. I have been on my feet for a literally uncountable amount of time.

[A step, some groaning, the jangle of bags, and creaking of what is presumably a couch as Martin sits.]
ARCHIVIST
How is it?

MARTIN
Great! (creak from the couch) It’s great. Lovely couch.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Well, rest up, I suppose!

MARTIN
It’s two-seater!

ARCHIVIST
(you are not getting me on that thing) Yes it is!

[Brief pause, in which there is a slight amused exhale and another creak of the couch.]
ARCHIVIST (CONT’D)
Hard pass, thank you.

[An exhale, and shift from Martin, with some sloshing, followed by a lovely little moment of silence but for the gull sounds and sirens in the far background.]
MARTIN
What’s it like?

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
This place’s – (inhale) its statement.

ARCHIVIST
Not too surprising. It’s a domain designed to eke fear out of those afraid of a world – (inhale) – destroyed by human hands. It, uh – (exhale) It dwells on it.

[An understanding hm from Martin.]
[Another brief moment of silence, then:]
MARTIN
(creak as he shifts) So it was real then, the Extinction?

ARCHIVIST
Of course it was real – A-At least in the sense that – it was a thing people feared.

Whether it was strong enough in its own right to be considered at a level with Smirke’s Fourteen, or – whether it was on its way to getting there, I – maybe. This sort of thing is always muddy.

MARTIN
So Peter was lying.

[The Archivist lets out his “it’s not that simple” sigh.]
ARCHIVIST
To a degree. But – mostly he was just like anyone else who tried to take the scope of human terror and – (small inhale) package it neatly into little theories. All this talk of Emergence and – birthing a new power – it’s just people being scared.

[Creak as Martin shifts.]
MARTIN
What, so no one had any idea?

ARCHIVIST
Martin, I have the whole scope of human knowledge available to me, and – (small inhale, sharp exhale) I’d struggle to give you a simple answer to most of this stuff.

And even if I am omniscient, I’m starting to realize that… doesn’t mean objective.

[Creak. Martin hms.]
MARTIN
(sigh) I guess it’s hard not to bring your own baggage to this sort of thing.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know if it could even exist without the baggage. You want to talk about psychological projection, try viewing the world through the lense of the being that is, by its very nature, a reflection of your own obsessions and fears.

MARTIN
(sigh) Yeah, alright. I get it.

But what about the – real world, were they right?

ARCHIVIST
I – I’m not sure I follow.

MARTIN
M– Right, if none of this had happened, if the world had just – carried on? (creak) What would have happened? Was – Was all that fear justified?

ARCHIVIST
(exhale, moving closer) I can’t know the future, Martin, not even a hypothetical one.

MARTIN
But – you know what was going on, what was happening. O-Out of everyone, you’re the best place – (squeak) You, you, you’ve got the info to make a pretty damn educated guess!

[Brief pause.]
ARCHIVIST
I, I don’t know what you want me to say, Martin. Yes, it was bad, worse than most people thought, and things were only going to deteriorate. But was the end of humanity actually imminent? I – probably not?

But we were well on the way, and – it would have been the end of an awful lot of things.

[Large creak.]
MARTIN
So you don’t think it would have been the end of the world?

[There’s a bit of a laugh to the end of his sentence.]
ARCHIVIST
The end of the world. Now there’s a concept. Everything ends, I suppose. (movement) Even this place. Can’t last forever. Eventually… it will die as well.

[Movement.]
MARTIN
You’re starting to sound like Simon.

ARCHIVIST
No. He was always looking towards the infinite, but I’m not sure there is such a thing. If I try, I can – (slight static) – see the edges of reality, but – I can’t hold its full scope in my mind.

[Static fades out.]
MARTIN
And beyond it?

ARCHIVIST
Beyond what? Reality?

MARTIN
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. Maybe nothing.

[Beat.]
[Then Martin creaks the couch again.]
MARTIN
John.

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
D’you know if – like – gods, religion, the afterlife, all that stuff. Do you know if any of that was real?

ARCHIVIST
(exhale, a bit amused) Really rolling out the big questions today.

MARTIN
Sorry, it’s just – this place just brings it out in me, I guess.

[Slight static kicks in again.]
ARCHIVIST
If there is a god, or gods, or an existence beyond this world, the Eye can’t see it. It sees the fear of it, but – nothing of its truth.

[Static fades.]
MARTIN
…So… is that a no?…

ARCHIVIST
It’s an ‘I don’t know,’ although – (heavy inhale) People’s faith – it hasn’t saved them. Not here.

MARTIN
(soft) True.

ARCHIVIST
Why do you ask? Didn’t think you were at all religious.

[Squeak.]
MARTIN
Oh, I’m not. Mum was, but – (squeak) I, I don’t know. With everything going on, it – (exhale) certainly feels less far-fetched. Besides, at this point, I’d take any help we can get.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know how kindly any god would look upon what we’ve done.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
Thanks for that.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

[A shift and a creak.]
MARTIN
Let’s get out of here. This place is making me a bit too… existential.

[He moves to get up, his clothing rustling and the bags squeaking and jangling.]
ARCHIVIST
Wait.

[Martin stops.]
MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
(sigh) Where we’re going, the, uh… (finds it) The next domain, I’ve been meaning to tell you, but it’s – well.

MARTIN
Spit it out, John.

ARCHIVIST
Basira and Daisy. We’re close.

MARTIN
Wait, what? Wait, really?! (sudden energy) B– Th-that’s brilliant; what are we waiting for; let’s go!

ARCHIVIST
I – uh – yeah, it’s – it’s not going to be easy; things aren’t… good.

MARTIN
(fast, high-pitched – he’s going to take the mick but he’s excited) Oh my goodness, really? And here was me thinking the apocalypse was going oh, so swimmingly!

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Yes, alright, I just meant –

MARTIN
(cutting him off) I, I know what you meant! I can still be keen to see our friends!

[He is definitely grinning ear to ear now; we can hear it in the laughter in his sentence.]
ARCHIVIST
True.

MARTIN
Besides, we can help them now.

[The Archivist sighs; they both start getting back on the road.]
ARCHIVIST
Yeah. (pause) Yeah.

[Their footsteps crunch as they walk.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[EXT. A DOMAIN OF THE HUNT]
[TAPE CLICKS ON.]
[The bags jingle and the ground crunches as the Archivist and Martin walk through what sounds like dense-ish foliage. The air is still, but in the way that still air can be “loud,” obtrusive in the background.]
ARCHIVIST
Hold on, take it easy.

[The bags jingle again as they come to a stop.]
ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
I’m going at a normal pace; you’re the one that’s slowing down!

ARCHIVIST
(quite put out) I am not.

MARTIN
You are!

[They’re both making an attempt to whisper/keep their voices low even as they argue.]
MARTIN
You’re dragging your feet. What’s up? (beat) What aren’t you telling me?

[In the background, a bird trills loudly.]
ARCHIVIST
Martin, please. I’m trying to find our way to Basira.

MARTIN
(:)) Talk to me, John.

ARCHIVIST
I’m fine.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
Glad to hear. And the fact that we’re hunting our friend in a domain of the Hunt isn’t getting to you at all? Not even a little bit? Hmm?

[The bird keeps going.]
ARCHIVIST
I don’t like betraying someone’s trust like this.

MARTIN
(gentle) It’s not a betrayal if you’re doing it to help.

ARCHIVIST
(rueful half-laugh) I’m not so sure.

MARTIN
Look, if it was me in her shoes, I’m sure I’d forgive you. It-It’s for the best!

ARCHIVIST
Mm.

MARTIN
Look, you’ll feel better about it when it’s done. Okay? Putting it off – it’s, it’s just going to make you feel worse.

ARCHIVIST
(slightly lower) Mm.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
Besides, I thought the Hunt was meant to make you go faster.

ARCHIVIST
Depends on the type of pursuit. (exhale) Besides, the chase isn’t really the point of this particular place.

MARTIN
Oh no?

ARCHIVIST
No.

MARTIN
…I can’t believe I’m asking this, but what is the point, then?

ARCHIVIST
…Have you ever had your friends turn on you? People you thought you could count on?

[Martin makes a couple of sounds that translate to how to put this?]
MARTIN
I mean… (another sound of indecision) I, I worry about it, but – but, actually, no? Not like a full-blown betrayal or anything.

ARCHIVIST
I’m glad. (inhale) Because this place focuses on that worry, that fear of your own pack turning their claws on you.

[Martin lets out a little hm.]
MARTIN
Is that… really a Hunt thing?

ARCHIVIST
Can be. The old divisions don’t mean as much these days. Maybe they never did. The domains are… smaller, more – personal than the powers.

They don’t just feed on the worst fears of the people trapped there; they’re shaped by them, too. It’s enough to fear the domain itself, if not the entire power behind it.

[Martin does another little hm.]
MARTIN
(somewhat begrudgingly) You should get that on a mug. ‘You don’t have to fear the Hunt to be trapped here…’

ARCHIVIST
(exhales) But it helps.

MARTIN
Look, so can we just – move on?

[He takes a step.]
ARCHIVIST
Soon.

MARTIN
Look, John, I didn’t want to say this, but we either need to move on or you need to tell me what’s going on because – (breaks off, steadying inhale) I think we’re being followed.

ARCHIVIST
(no hesitation) We are.

MARTIN
Oh. ‘Kay. That’s not actually what I wanted to hear.

ARCHIVIST
I know, that’s why I didn’t mention it before.

MARTIN
(inhale) But we’re safe, right?

ARCHIVIST
As long as you remain calm, yes, absolutely.

[Pause.]
MARTIN
So – So are you going to tell me what’s going on? What the plan is?

ARCHIVIST
We’re going to find Basira.

MARTIN
(passive-aggressiveness kicking in) No, John, that’s the goal. (faster) What I want is the plan, the steps in between that need us to be hunted through the woods. I’m flying blind here, I’m –

[The bird from earlier starts up again, and Martin falters into silence.]
ARCHIVIST
(exhaling) Yeah. I’m sorry. I do know what I’m doing.

MARTIN
How nice for you, but I don’t, unless you tell me! How-How are you even going to approach Basira?

[Bird.]
ARCHIVIST
It’s tricky. She’s – (inhale) She’s had a bad time.

MARTIN
(slight scoff) I mean – haven’t we all?

ARCHIVIST
No. No, we haven’t.

[Slight pause, and then:]
MARTIN
Right.

ARCHIVIST
If we approach her directly, she’s likely to bolt. And she can move a lot quicker than we can.

MARTIN
Yeah, okay, but I’m still not hearing a plan as such.

ARCHIVIST
I –

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
Uh – Hold on.

MARTIN
Oh my god, are you actually serious, right now?

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry!

[Martin sighs.]
MARTIN
Fine. Just – I’ll keep a lookout, be quick.

ARCHIVIST
I’ll do my best.

[He rustles his way through the surroundings a bit to put some distance between him and Martin.]
[Then, his static kicks in, and:]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Feet pound silent whisper silent blood on lips blood on teeth blood scent of hated prey flows through veins and into feet pound silent in pursuit.

Teeth smile. Ready to kill.

[In the background, under his words, we hear the jagged breath of someone running, someone running in fear.]
The lashing branches reach and claw and try to hold back the charging vengeance of the pack. But they slip, and fall away.

The killers make no sound as they move across the forest floor, their steps quick and certain.

[We hear them running.]
In the distance they hear the crashing stumble of the one who deserves to be hunted, all stealth forgotten in the panicked flight from righteous cleansing violence.

There are no names among the pack, no words, only a razor-keen unity of purpose, a shared loathing of the sickly scent of the one they chase.

A mutual determination that their quarry does not deserve to live.

If any were able to form the words to express them, no doubt the crimes listed of their prey would be as varied as the pack themselves, and some, perhaps, even true.

But that is not important, not really. Not the driving, pounding need behind the hunt, what spurs pursuit of tooth and claw is not some calmly made assessment or judgement on the weight of the hunted’s sin.

It is the need to tear and rend and coat their faces slick with the blood of the guilty that pulses through every fibre of them. The thumping need inside their head to hate, and to be right within that hate. To taste the blood of those who have declared themselves deserving of it.

But as the pack runs, each and all among them are afraid.

Of what?

The pounding in their heart drowns out the unease, makes it hard to taste and feel it out, but it is there.

Are they afraid of their prey, fleeing in abject terror, their trail marked clear by the scent of fear? No, it can’t be.

But what else could it be? Surely not their packmates, sprinting along the side, leaping, jumping, grinning in anticipation, moving as a group, their minds as one, never looking each other in the eye.

Up ahead, the quarry trips, cries out, tumbles to the floor in a desperate heap. They try to stagger to their feet but they are caught in the undergrowth, ankle twisted, vine wrapped around it.

They already lost their boots, and now their bare and muddy foot is trapped, flesh and dirt and oozing blood, the blood that fills the nostrils of these hunters, and drives their furious chase with the awful scent of its transgression.

Tears flow, too, but no one notices, and no one cares. Their punishment is at hand.

In moments, the prey is surrounded. The spaces between the trees are filled with eyes that hate and hands that hold the promise of a life ended on the rotting leaves of the forest floor.

They smile, and their teeth glint in the moonlight, still red with all that remains of their last morsel of prey.

They begin to step closer. One step. Two steps. When the prey turns, they are still, but they surround in all directions, moving slowly when they are not being watched.

What’s the time, Mr. Wolf? The time to run is over. The time to suffer has arrived.

But there is one last burst of strength within the prey. Not strength of arm, or speed of escape – what good is fight-or-flight in this place? But a strength of voice, of bitter, angry recrimination. Hurling accusations upon their pursuers: hypocrites,bullies,pathetic wretches that would hound the innocent so.

Perhaps the prey earnestly believes it, casts themself full woeful into the mold of victim, of one who has done no wrong.

Or perhaps they feel within themself the weight of the sin stinking out of them, flaring the hearts of their persecutors, but see in the faces that approach them those same transgressions shining, reflected back upon them.

It doesn’t matter in the end; the cry is the same: “This isn’t fair. This isn’t right.”

The pack descends and the prey is silenced, protests cut short by teeth digging into throat, nails piercing skin and clawing at gristle, bones shattering under relentless, merciless blows.

And the blood and bile flow freely, exciting the pack to ever-greater raptures of cruelty, of pure and cleansing rage.

They taste their fury in every corner of them. There is no sound to break their peace but the wet ripping of flesh and the occasional transcendent scream of deserved agony.

And then it is over.

There is a moment, a single, holy moment of blessed absolution, washed clean in sweet and sticky blood.

And then the unease returns. The uncertainty and fear that at some moments gripped them throughout their pursuit.

They look around from one to another, aware as they stand over the twitching remains, that they are suddenly without prey.

Expressions sharpen, eyes narrow, growls begin to bubble up deep from within each chest. They are afraid.

They can each smell it wafting from the others, but who will it be? Who is the most afraid?

Which of them held back? Which of them – there. You. Blood on your hands, no doubt; blood on your lips – but not much. Not much at all.

Perhaps you couldn’t get close enough; there were so many hunters, after all. Or perhaps you stayed your hand out of mercy. Out of… sympathy.

Perhaps you stink of that same sin.

No words need to be spoken, no accusations put in so coarse a form as voice. The pack immediately knows which among them is no longer theirs, which has exposed their own inequity.

Which is now prey.

[We hear the singled-out ex-Hunter gasp and turn to run.]
The prey turns and runs, all grace of the Hunt forgotten as they stumble, crashing through undergrowth and dirt.

Behind them, feet pound silent.

[Static rises and fades.]
[The Archivist exhales.]
ARCHIVIST
I’m done.

[Pause, and then he picks his way back.]
ARCHIVIST
You alright?

MARTIN
(snapping) Just peachy. (softening) I don’t – I don’t know; I feel like I saw something in the trees.

ARCHIVIST
You did.

MARTIN
(clearly on edge) Oh! Fantastic. You’re very reassuring, you know that?

[The bird trills again as he speaks.]
MARTIN
Is it that – pack thing you were talking about?

ARCHIVIST
No, they’d have – (inhale, quick exhale) They’d have no interest in us. We’re not one of them.

MARTIN
Look, John, if – if you know what it is, then why don’t you just tell me, so that –

ARCHIVIST
(overlapping) Hold up.

Sh.

[But Martin has reached his limit:]
MARTIN
Wh– no! No, John; you just did a statement; I don’t care if you want another one, we’ve gotta move –

ARCHIVIST
(cutting him off) Martin.

[Martin stops.]
[Pause, in which there is some quiet movement.]
ARCHIVIST
Right. Martin, do you trust me?

MARTIN
What? Ah, Christ, this can’t be good. Yes?

ARCHIVIST
Then it’s very – listen, (movement) – look at me. The next couple of minutes are going to be quite unpleasant for one of us, and I’m sorry.

MARTIN
Uh – (sounds of incomprehension) Sorry, what?

ARCHIVIST
You need to remain very calm, and don’t make any sudden movements.

MARTIN
Oh, okay, now I’m worried; what d’you –

[He’s cut off by a rush of movement; his words turn to tiny gasps, and then are cut off completely – hand over his mouth?]
[Something – no, someone – growls.]
TREVOR HERBERT
(with some desperation) Don’t move! Don’t you fucking move!

[Martin gasps out a choked breath.]
TREVOR
(to the Archivist) And don’t you say a word, or I’ll cut him open! I know what that voice of yours can do, so shut it!

ARCHIVIST
(best customer service voice) Mhm.

[There is silence but for Trevor’s ragged breathing for a moment.]
[Then:]
TREVOR
(exhaling) Okay. You can talk. But slow-like. You try and do any of that – word magic, and he’s dead.

ARCHIVIST
(slowly) Understood.

[Trevor exhales heavily.]
ARCHIVIST
Hello, Trevor.

MARTIN
(afraid, trying not to show it) John? What’s going on?

ARCHIVIST
It’s okay. Trust me.

MARTIN
(high) Okay.

TREVOR
It’s not okay. Stop fucking smiling!

[He must tighten his grip, because Martin lets out a pained sound.]
MARTIN
(voice shaking, trying to sound unaffected) John? I know you keep saying we’re safe, and I am feeling very calm, but just so I know – Can he – Can he kill me?

ARCHIVIST
He could, yes.

MARTIN
Right.

ARCHIVIST
If he were still a Hunter.

TREVOR
(hissing) Shut it. ‘Course I’m still a Hunter!

[He tightens his grip or digs in the knife or emphasizes whatever he’s got again; Martin lets out a slightly louder pained sound.]
[Trevor’s breathing is heavy, and he grunts.]
MARTIN
(the customer is always right!) Mmhmhm – gotta go with Trevor on that one, John!

ARCHIVIST
(low) No. Right now he’s prey.

[The bird from earlier trills.]
ARCHIVIST
How long have you been running now, Trevor?

[Trevor’s breathing becomes even more ragged, more fearful.]
TREVOR
Don’t know. Too long.

ARCHIVIST
And Julia?

[Pause. Bird.]
TREVOR
Dead.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

TREVOR
Shut it!

[But it’s tearful. It’s lost some of its bite.]
TREVOR
Should’ve been me. I’m old. Slow. (breathing harder, tearful) It’s not fair, outliving her.

But that dog of yours, that rabid bitch – she – (loses words) Killed her first, so she could see me limp away.

It’s a game to her.

ARCHIVIST
If you’re looking for my pity, I’m afraid it’s too late.

MARTIN
John…?

TREVOR
(gaining fuel again) What I want, is to make you feel the same loss!

MARTIN
(!!) John!

ARCHIVIST
It’s okay, Martin. (to Trevor) Maybe I spoke too soon. Maybe I do have some pity for you.

After all, I know you, Trevor; you’ve had a tough life. Hardship from beginning to – (small heh) This strange and twisted end.

TREVOR
Never complained.

ARCHIVIST
No. You haven’t, have you? And maybe that’s the greatest tragedy of all this.

I’m – sorry, Trevor.

[Silence but for Trevor’s breathing, which slowly gains in intensity.]
TREVOR
For what?

ARCHIVIST
For putting us all in this situation. I had hoped you’d go for me, but – well.

I’m sorry I’ve reduced you lower even than prey.

MARTIN
John?…

[Trevor snorts, but not in an offhand way. In the way that a cornered horse or bull might.]
TREVOR
No.

ARCHIVIST
To bait.

MARTIN
(breathing faster) Don’t –

[Gunshot.]
[Martin whimpers.]
MARTIN
(recovering, high) Oh-hoh. Hoh. Christ, you just – He jus–

[He lets out an incomprehensible sound.]
ARCHIVIST
Relax, Martin.

MARTIN
(very high) I, I’m not gonna – I’m not gonna relax; I’m sick of never knowing what’s going on, and then –

[As he speaks, there are footsteps, coming closer across the brush.]
ARCHIVIST
Hello, Basira.

MARTIN
(exhale) I – E– (more incomprehensible stuttering) Basira?

BASIRA
Don’t move. Either of you.

MARTIN
(still kinda high) Hey! Hey, hey. Whoa. Whoa, Basira, it’s us.

BASIRA
I said don’t move. This place plays tricks.

ARCHIVIST
It is us, Basira.

BASIRA
(yeah, right) Mhm? Sure. And you just happened to wander right into Trevor’s path when I was tracking him. What a fun coincidence for everybody.

ARCHIVIST
Not a coincidence.

[The bird trills.]
MARTIN
(with some effort) Can I at least put my hands down? M-M,My arms are kinda getting tired.

BASIRA
Prove you’re real.

MARTIN
I – Wh,What? Like, like – pinch… you, or?

[There’s a tiny snicker from the Archivist as he trails off.]
BASIRA
Prove you’re really Martin Blackwood.

MARTIN
How?

ARCHIVIST
(picture of innocence) You could do a poem.

BASIRA
Shut up.

MARTIN
(hissing) John, this is serious!

BASIRA
What’s something only Martin would know?

[Pause.]
MARTIN
What? I don’t know!

BASIRA
Fine. Then –

[We hear her cock the gun.]
MARTIN
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, wait, wait, uh – I – oh, I don’t know, we’ve never hung out much! I’ve no idea what you know about me!

[Pause as Basira considers this. Another, different bird screeches in the background.]
[Basira shifts to the Archivist.]
BASIRA
What about you?

ARCHIVIST
I mean – (holding back laugh, badly) I can know literally anything, so – ask away I guess.

BASIRA
You understand how unhelpful that is for proving identities.

ARCHIVIST
(audible grin) I’m sorry to be an inconvenience.

BASIRA
Well, you better think of something, or…

[She waggles the gun.]
ARCHIVIST
Basira, I know you’re not going to shoot us. There’s already too much doubt in your mind.

[Pause.]
BASIRA
I told you before not to look into my head.

ARCHIVIST
(smug) So you do believe it’s me, then.

[Brief pause.]
BASIRA
Know-it-all prick.

[We hear her put the gun away.]
MARTIN
So – Can I – ?

BASIRA
Yeah, put them down, Martin. It’s fine. You’re you.

[Martin does so, and in the process lets out a huge sigh of relief. And another. And another, as Basira and the Archivist keep talking:]
ARCHIVIST
You’re sure?

BASIRA
If you were monsters, that would mean I’d finally get to kill something with your smug face. No way am I that lucky.

ARCHIVIST
Can’t fault your logic.

BASIRA
Come on. You’ve wasted enough time already.

MARTIN
Wh– (sputtering) Wh– Hey, wait!

BASIRA
I said come on!

[She starts walking.]
MARTIN
Wh–! Wh–! John?

[The Archivist just shoulders his bag with a jingle.]
ARCHIVIST
(enjoying this way too much) After you.

[Martin sighs.]
[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
[CLICK]
[FOOTSTEPS ECHO IN A CORRIDOR, A TANNOY MUMBLES WORDS INDISTINCTLY AND TINNY MUZAK PLAYS FAINTLY]
MARTIN
Look, this is ridiculous, Basira. Can we please just talk?

BASIRA
No.

MARTIN
Why not?

ARCHIVIST
Martin…

MARTIN
[Exasperated] No, John. Enough is enough. It has been hours and not a bloody word! We have been slogging our way through literal nightmares to find you, Basira. There’s been p-plagues and wars and monsters and I– we’ve been worried sick. It has been awful and the least that –

BASIRA
Can’t have been that bad.

MARTIN
I – what?

BASIRA
You look fine to me.

MARTIN
[Indignant] Excuse me?

BASIRA
Whole and healthy with a shoulder to lean on every step of the way.

MARTIN
Basira…

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] Martin, leave it.

Trust me. She’s been through a lot more than we have.

MARTIN
I-It’s not a competition! Christ! I just wanted to talk. That’s all.

BASIRA
So talk.

MARTIN
I mean stop and talk.

[FOOTSTEPS STOP]
BASIRA
I’d love that, Martin. I really would. Unfortunately, you two cost me my only lead on Daisy. And I need to find her before she moves on. So unless you have something useful to say…

ARCHIVIST
[Wearily] Daisy’s not here. She’s already moved on.

BASIRA
What?

MARTIN
See, this is exactly the kind of thing that comes up when we talk –

BASIRA
[Impatient] Martin!

ARCHIVIST
I told you, I know everything now, more or less. I can see her. With my, uh…

BASIRA
…

Magic horrorvision?

ARCHIVIST
Sure.

MARTIN
It’s actually been amazingly useful so far.

BASIRA
So you can control it now?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
Hmm.

MARTIN
So…

We know she’s not here, and John can find her wherever she goes… it sounds to me like we actually do have a moment to talk. Hm?

…

You might not care but it is good to see you Basira. It has been a long time since we saw a friendly face.

BASIRA
Friendly wasn’t what I was going for.

MARTIN
All I’m saying is, it’s nice to find someone we can trust again. Ever since everything went to hell, it’s just been –

BASIRA
Yeah, about that.

[Pointedly to The Archivist] You caused this, didn’t you?

[THE ARCHIVIST GIVES A HEAVY BREATH]
Don’t give me that look, you know what I mean. Did you mess up the world? Yes or no.

ARCHIVIST
…

Yes.

BASIRA
Goddamnit! I knew it was you! I knew it!

MARTIN
Basira…

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t mean to. Elias was…

We were all playing out this big ritual for him. With me as the lynchpin, the gate.

BASIRA
Oh you didn’t mean to! Oh that’s all right then. Christ! I should’ve known… I… I should’ve just let Daisy take you out at the start.

MARTIN
You don’t mean that.

BASIRA
No?

[Exhales] I don’t know. Maybe. If I had… it would have stopped all this, wouldn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Perhaps.

Perhaps not.

BASIRA
I thought you knew everything?

MARTIN
He can’t do hypotheticals.

BASIRA
And if I killed you now?

MARTIN
What did I just say?

ARCHIVIST
You couldn’t. And even if you could, it wouldn’t be enough to undo what’s happened to the world.

BASIRA
So… what? You’re the immortal god of this messed up little hellscape now?

ARCHIVIST
‘God’ might be stretching it. [Deep breath] But I am more powerful now, yes.

BASIRA
Brilliant.

MARTIN
…

Okay, well since we’re talking, I-I was wondering… I don’t know if, if I missed it, or if you both just assumed that I knew, since you knew it already, but, well…

BASIRA
Spit it out.

MARTIN
What was the deal with Trevor? Why was he… I mean, I’m not really sure what happened back there?

BASIRA
Seriously? You brought him here, and you didn’t brief him, Mr. All-Seeing-Eye?

MARTIN
Oh, he just keeps being vague and ominous.

BASIRA
Well, some things don’t change then.

ARCHIVIST
It was a courtesy. I wasn’t sure what you’d be comfortable with me sharing.

BASIRA
Oh how generous.

MARTIN
Basira…

We want to help you.

BASIRA
…

So, when everything went sideways at the institute, I lost track of Daisy and Julia Montauk. I know Daisy managed to kill her, but I don’t know the details. Didn’t find any sign of them in the Archives, at least.

ARCHIVIST
It was about a week later. They’d been stalking each other through the tunnels beneath the city. Daisy managed to corner her in an old subway access, and tore out her throat. Trevor found the body three hours later.

BASIRA
[Irritated] Do you want to tell it?

ARCHIVIST
Sorry. I thought you’d want me to fill in on the missing details.

BASIRA
I don’t.

Anyway, seems like since then Trevor was tracking Daisy. Wanted revenge, you heard him. I was still in the Institute when everything went to hell outside, so I guess that protected me from the first wave. Once I saw what had happened… that we’d lost…

Didn’t feel like there was anything left worth doing, except keeping my promise to Daisy. So I went looking. Found Trevor’s trail eventually and started tailing him. Hoped I could follow him as he tracked Daisy, but… then you had to blunder your way in as always, and I had to step in.

MARTIN
Sorry.

BASIRA
It’s his fault. He used you to bait Trevor, to bait me.

MARTIN
Wait, I’m, I’m sorry, you used me as bait?

ARCHIVIST
I used us as bait. I didn’t know which one he’d go for.

MARTIN
Yeah, sure, but… only one of us was aware of the plan.

ARCHIVIST
I’m, I’m sorry. I was going to tell you, but then I-I got distracted and… then we were within earshot of him, and I couldn’t say anything and… I-I mean, you would have agreed, right?

MARTIN
That’s not the point, John.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

MARTIN
…

It’s okay. I understand.

[FABRIC RUSTLES]
BASIRA
You done?

ARCHIVIST
Can we not have a moment?

BASIRA
No, John, we can’t. This is a chase, remember? Time is a factor.

ARCHIVIST
Less than you might think.

So what happens next?

BASIRA
What do you think? You just cost me my only lead to Daisy. All I have now is you, and you owe me.

ARCHIVIST
So I guide you to Daisy.

BASIRA
Is she close?

ARCHIVIST
When did I become everybody’s satnav?

BASIRA / MARTIN
John.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, alright.

[FAINT STATIC]
No, not really. She was here, but the corridors of this place are… Rushing isn’t going to close the distance faster. It’s more about how we choose to move through these domains rather than our speed.

BASIRA
What does that mean?

MARTIN
I’ve been with him the whole way and I still don’t know.

ARCHIVIST
It means we’ll reach her quicker if you stop tearing off, and let me concentrate on finding a proper path through this place.

MARTIN
Yeah, speaking of, where actually are we, anyway? I mean, I’m happy to be out of the woods, but –

ARCHIVIST
Wonderland House. A, uh… mental ‘health’ facility.

MARTIN
Oh. Oh dear.

ARCHIVIST
Mmhm.

Right. Daisy. Give me a moment.

[LOUDER STATIC]
BASIRA
So… Did you actually walk all the way down here from Scotland?

MARTIN
Kind of. Scotland’s not really a thing anymore.

BASIRA
Huh. London’s still there. Sort of.

MARTIN
Yeah, that’s where we’re heading. Eventually.

He’s been destroying other avatars on the way.

BASIRA
Oh. That’s… good, I guess. How’s he doing it?

MARTIN
He’s getting the Eye to, like… like, look at them? H-He just kind of drinks up all their fear and they, uh, they just sort of… implode?

BASIRA
Sounds satisfying.

MARTIN
Yeah. Not sure how much good it does, though. And one of them was a kid.

BASIRA
John killed a kid?

MARTIN
What? No. No! No, I just mean, one of the avatars we saw was, like, thirteen or so.

BASIRA
That’s messed up.

MARTIN
Yeah. We had to let him go, ‘cause… well, I mean…

BASIRA
Yeah.

MARTIN
Yeah.

BASIRA
…

What’s it like? Being with someone who can see the inside of your head?

MARTIN
Hm? Oh. Oh no, he doesn’t. I told him not to, and so he tries to… look away.

BASIRA
And you trust him to do that.

MARTIN
[Certain] Yes. I do.

BASIRA
…

So what’s your plan?

MARTIN
Long term? Elias. He’s up in that… Panopticon tower thing.

BASIRA
Figured as much. What’s he up to?

MARTIN
John doesn’t know. He says it’s a ‘blind spot’.

BASIRA
A blind spot.

MARTIN
A-Apparently.

BASIRA
Convenient. What about Melanie?

MARTIN
He’s… not sure about her either. He can’t see her or Georgie.

BASIRA
Dead, then.

[STATIC FADES]
ARCHIVIST
No. Not dead. Just hidden somehow.

BASIRA
Back with us, then?

ARCHIVIST
I know the route. Come on.

[FOOTSTEPS START AGAIN]
It… will take us past Daisy’s victim, though.

MARTIN
Victim?

BASIRA
She’s been killing.

MARTIN
What? No, no, that can’t be right. I thought people weren’t even allowed to die any more.

ARCHIVIST
Not permanently, but… Ah.

[FOOTSTEPS STOP]
BASIRA
What is it?

MARTIN
Really? Now?

ARCHIVIST
I’ll try to be quick.

BASIRA
What’s going on?

MARTIN
It’s, it… he needs to make a statement.

BASIRA
Is that like a euphemism or…?

MARTIN
Ew, no! It’s… um, he sort of describes the place he’s in to the recorder and… Look it’s, it’s magic Eye stuff. He can’t help it. He needs to do it and if he doesn’t…

BASIRA
He gets constipated?

ARCHIVIST
Hardly!

MARTIN
Actually, yeah, basically.

BASIRA
Right.

ARCHIVIST
Look if you can both just give me some space, I’d appreciate it.

MARTIN
Fine. I’ll keep lookout.

[MARTIN MOVES AWAY]
BASIRA
No. If it’s information about this domain, I think I’d better hear it.

ARCHIVIST
[Sighingly] If you say so…

[STATIC RISES]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
[FOOTSTEPS, A TELEPHONE RINGS]
Hi. How are we doing? You can call me Doctor David. I’ll be here to help you out for the duration of your stay with us. Do you have a name? Hm. Hm. Well, I’m afraid I’ll have to disagree with you there. That’s not your name at all.

Now don’t get agitated, I’m sure we’ll get there. Names are… tricky. You know how long it took me to realise I was Doctor David? I mean, neither do I, to be perfectly honest, but the point is names can take a while. And we’ll be here to support you every step of the way.

Hm? Oh, didn’t they tell you when you were signed in? Not to worry, these things slip my mind as well sometimes. You’re in Wonderland House. We’re a small residential mental health facility here to help people like you come to their senses. And to protect the world from all your self-indulgent nonsense in the meantime.

I can, I assure you. I’m your doctor. Doctor David. I’m here to help you, to treat you, to make it so you’re less of a… burden to everyone. And until I’m satisfied that we’ve reached that point, well, there’s plenty here to keep you comfortable. Because obviously, it wouldn’t be responsible of us to let you out into general society. Not in your current state. Hm? No, of course it’s not just them. We’re here to help you. You’re the biggest victim of… whatever little game you’re playing here. And we know just how to help you.

Please do try not to get so agitated. I understand, it’s a distressing time, but there’s really nothing to be gained from… acting out. There are no windows to escape through, all the –

[SOUND OF CHAIR ROCKING]
Yes, as I was saying, all the furniture is very firmly bolted down, and honestly you’re only going to hurt yoursel–

[SOMETHING SNAPS]
Hm. I see. Violence, then, is it? Oh, I assure you there is no way to hurt me. Nothing you could say or do could cause me even a moment’s inconvenience. Your anger is… pointless. Meaningless. Look, see? The only thing you’ve managed to hurt is your own hand. Now, are we finally in a position to listen to Doctor David, you… meaningless little brat? Good.

Now, I believe it’s time for your medication.

[PILLS RATTLE]
Oh, no, that stuff you were on before? Mm, garbage. No, I’ve torn up your prescription for that. It was… poison, I assure you, warping your mind. No, I think we have something far better here.

[PILLS RATTLE]
Go on, take it.

[PILL BOTTLE IS PLACED DOWN]
Take it.

Or do I have to get some orderlies to help you?

[LIQUID SWALLOWING; CUP IS PLACED DOWN]
There you go. Down the hatch. I wonder what it was? Certainly it looked a pretty appealing colour in the medicine cabinet, but you never can tell with these things. Oh, there you go. Well, sweet dreams, I suppose.

Do try to wake up sane.

[EXIT WITH CREEPY LAUGH]
[DOOR NOISES PLUS FOOTSTEPS]
Ah, awake at last, are we? Excellent. Allow me to introduce myself. Call me Doctor David. And you might be? No, I just like to greet all our new arrivals in person and I would like your name, if possible. Okay, well, I don’t think that’s how it’s pronounced, but… if that’s what you’d like me to call you, then I suppose I can do you that favour.

Hm? No, I’m pretty sure I would remember.

No, I’m the only Doctor David on staff at Wonderland House. Goodness can you imagine the coincidence if there were two of us. Hah! Hardly bears thinking about. But no, I’m the only one here. Fact of the matter is, I’m the only doctor on staff. Most days it’s just me and the orderlies. No-one else around for miles.

You’re sure? Well, that is very strange. Would you mind describing this ‘other’ Doctor David. Mmhm? Mmhm? Oh, did he now? Well isn’t that fascinating.

Right, well, I think I’m starting to see what might be going on here and, let me assure you, it isn’t going to work. Oh, I know, I know, I know. It’s just that we have no patience here for your ridiculous lies. Seeing things? Phantom doctors? You really think I’m that much of an idiot? You concoct some half-baked little hallucination, and suddenly I’m stamping ‘crazy’ on your forehead? I’m dreadfully sorry to disappoint you, but that’s not how things work here.

Oh, other doctors did, did they? Mm. Well, that sounds reasonable, let me just have a look at your case file here, a gander at the old medical history. Medication, diagnosis, medication, oooh, hospitalisation. Hm.

Trouble is it’s all lies, isn’t it? Because I’m your doctor now, Doctor David, and I say these people, these ‘professionals’, had no idea what they’re talking about because, well, I understand what they simply didn’t.

You made it all up, didn’t you?

What was it? A plea for attention, trying so desperately to make the world notice you? Some childish attempt to feel special? Or were you just looking for an excuse for the fact that you’re a lazy, unlikeable waste of air?

‘Paranoia’, hm, it’s big word, isn’t it? A big excuse. Because here’s the interesting thing: you are completely sane and rational. Everyone legitimately does hate you. It’s not your brain making up lies, don’t be stupid. No, you’re just a horribly unpleasant person to be around. You make people uncomfortable. You never say the right thing. You somehow always manage to smell bad.

No wonder people talk about you behind your back. Even I hate you, and I’m responsible for your treatment. Isn’t that funny?

[MIRTHLESS CHUCKLE]
Hm? Oh, I’m sure you would like some medication. Yes, I’m sure you would. That chemical safety blanket whispering to you ‘Oh don’t worry you’re just mad. You don’t need to take responsibility for anything.’ You’ll get none of that nonsense here. No. We’ll teach you to stand on your own two feet. And we have all the time in the world to do so.

[FOOTSTEPS, THEN DOOR SOUNDS]
Good night.

[DOOR SOUNDS, FOOTSTEPS. THE DISTANT SOUND OF SCREAMS]
Ah, good morning. How are we feeling today? Hm? Oh, no it’s just me. Call me Doctor David. No, I’m pretty sure I’ve always had this face.

Oh, I see, another of your lies, is it, as though I haven’t heard enough of them in the, what, five years I’ve been treating you now. No matter. Yes, five years, can we please not start that again?

Did you sleep well? Hm? Well, that makes sense I suppose. Nightmares are to be expected from a mind like yours.

Ooh, monsters, you say? You must have gotten a look at Brian the orderly.

[MIRTHLESS, SOMEWHAT MANIC, CHUCKLING]
I joke, of course. You seem fine, though, so I’m sure whatever that silly little imagination of yours concocted, it can’t have been all that bad.

Oh, yes? More ‘hallucinations’? Hm, well, you can describe them to me if you like, I’m certain they’re quite horrible. But on other hand, they didn’t happen, you’re lying, and everyone wishes you’d just stop making a fuss. You remember your mother, what you made her do because you just couldn’t be bothered to pull yourself together?

Yes, of course it was your fault, we’ve been over this quite extensively in our earlier sessions. Or are you still pretending not to remember?

I really wish you’d stop saying that. We don’t really like the word ‘mad’ in Wonderland House. Because you’re not. You never have been. You just need to… Oh do calm down you hysterical little creep. Throwing another tantrum will get you nowhere here.

[SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT, SOMETHING FALLING]
Oh violence, is it? Very original. Just do be careful not to –

[SOUNDS OF MOTION, A SCUFFLE, THEN FLESH PEELING]
[DRIPPING NOISES]
Well, I hope you’re happy. Well, what did you expect to be under my face? You really should stop screaming, you’re only upsetting yourself. Of course it’s real, it’s absolutely real. I’ve told you, you’re quite sane. You just need to admit it, and then we can get on with things.

No rush, though, like I say. We have all the time in the world. And good old Doctor David isn’t going anywhere.

[STATIC SOUNDS]
[DEEP EXHALATION]
ARCHIVIST
Satisfied?

BASIRA
Fuck.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[FOOTSTEPS ECHO IN A CORRIDOR, TINNY MUZAK PLAYS FAINTLY]
BASIRA
No, I get that bit, it’s just… So the guy was mad, or…?

ARCHIVIST
No, it – it… I mean, yes. It’s sort of, like… gaslighting, but in reverse. This place, it’s built on the fear that your mental health problems aren’t actually real.

BASIRA
Wouldn’t that be a good thing?

ARCHIVIST
N-No… I’m not explaining it very well. Uh, it’s… It’s the worry that everything is, is awful, and it’s actually your fault. Th-That you made it up? Um… that you’re…

BASIRA
What?

ARCHIVIST
Bad therapists. Let’s just say it’s the fear of bad therapists, filtered through The Spiral.

BASIRA
That’s.. a lot more nuanced than I’ve gotten used to since everything went wrong.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, well, The Spiral is nothing if not insidious.

MARTIN
[Nervously] Uh… Is that door meant to be open? And… dripping blood.

ARCHIVIST
We’re here.

[DOOR CREAKS]
MARTIN
Oh, Jesus.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Horrible way to go.

BASIRA
You’re sure this is Daisy’s handiwork?

ARCHIVIST
Positive. She’d been prowling around for a long time, waiting for a gap in the ‘treatments’ And when she got one, she carved through the door like it was paper. He tried to run, but she was so fast. She took his legs first, slicing through the tendons so that he could –

BASIRA
Enough. We get it.

…

Let’s go, then.

MARTIN
Wait, what? That’s it?

BASIRA
What else is there?

MARTIN
Seriously? I mean, who is this guy? Daisy slaughters someone, and you don’t even want to know why? You… What, you don’t care?

BASIRA
[Uncomfortably] We don’t have time.

ARCHIVIST
…

I could tell you.

BASIRA
Don’t bother. I know who he is.

MARTIN
What?

BASIRA
[Sigh] Noah Thomson. Nasty piece of work. Crossed him a few times when we weren’t doing sectioned work. Last I heard he’d dodged a GBH charge Daisy brought him in on. Blinded a guy during a robbery. I guess she didn’t forget.

MARTIN
Wait, wait… so… so, she’s hunting down criminals? People who she thinks got away with stuff?

BASIRA
…

Sure.

ARCHIVIST
Really? As simple as that?

BASIRA
What’s your point?

ARCHIVIST
What, you think he ended up in Wonderland House at random? We’re just going to ignore it, and write him off as a ‘nasty piece of work’?

BASIRA
We don’t have time for this.

ARCHIVIST
Then we should make time. You want to hear how he ended up blinding that man? Because it wasn’t a robbery. He was running away from Daisy, lashing out in a panic. The court believed it. But you believed her…

BASIRA
[Angry] I told you not to look in my head!

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t. And I won’t. But you can’t hunt a monster that you refuse to see.

[TENSE SILENCE]
[SOUND OF AN ELEVATOR ARRIVING WITH A SUDDEN ‘BING’]
[MARTIN JUMPS]
HELEN
Not interrupting anything, Am I?

MARTIN
Christ, Helen, you scared the life out of me.

HELEN
[Insincere] Sorry, darling.

ARCHIVIST
Not now, Helen.

HELEN
I’m sorry to butt in, but I was paying a visit to dear old Doctor David. You know, this place goes through nurses at an alarming rate, and I couldn’t help but overhear your little problem.

BASIRA
Really don’t need your opinion on this.

HELEN
Good to see you, too, Basira. You’re looking well. And don’t worry, I’ve no interest in your little ethical wobbles. No, I mean your issue with a certain feral runaway. I can help you, if you’d like.

ARCHIVIST
No, thank you.

BASIRA
What sort of help?

ARCHIVIST
You can’t be serious…

HELEN
See, John, this is what I like to see! A proactive attitude, keen to work together. Someone really living their best apocalypse.

BASIRA
I asked you a question.

HELEN
You did, didn’t you? I can offer a shortcut. Take you right to that murder machine you call a partner.

MARTIN
Basira, John can’t go through Helen’s doors. We couldn’t come with you.

HELEN
Basira is a strong, independent woman. She doesn’t need you two holding her hand.  Anyway, it’ll be dead quick. Two minutes, door-to-door, quick shot to the back of Daisy’s head, and we’ll be home before you know it.

ARCHIVIST
…

You just heard what The Spiral does to people. You can’t trust her.

HELEN
Nonsense! Martin can vouch for me. You and.. what’s-his-name went through Michael’s door, right? And he was rubbish compared to me.

MARTIN
We were in there for two weeks.

HELEN
Exactly! And you’re just fine! Better than fine! Flourishing!

MARTIN
You really don’t care, do you?

HELEN
Alright, be like that. Under new management, anyway. So what’s it going to be Basira darling? Quick and easy?

Or are you looking to take the long way round as a third wheel?

BASIRA
…

I’ll stick with the guys, thanks.

[DISAPPOINTED NOISE]
HELEN
Such a shame. And here I thought you were actually going to follow through. Ah well, good luck. And do give my best to Daisy. If you ever do find her.

BASIRA
You done?

HELEN
Oh, John? Not to sound like a squeaky hinge, but do try to lighten up. Don’t get me wrong, the brooding thing’s a good look on you, but it is starting to get a bit tired. Especially now you’ve got someone else to do the intense, driven thing. I think you might need to get a new schtick.

ARCHIVIST
[Sarcastic] Thank you for the feedback. I’ll try to bear it in mind.

HELEN
It’s all I ask! Anyway, I should be off. Don’t want to be late for rounds. Ciao!

[FOOTSTEPS HEAD OFF]
MARTIN
Is it me or is she getting worse? I think I preferred it when she wasn’t quite so… I don’t know… Chummy?

ARCHIVIST
What? You thought the end of the world would bring out the best in her?

MARTIN
Hmm.

BASIRA
Now, can we just go?

ARCHIVIST
Sure. This way.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[SOUNDS OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING, MOVING BODIES AND THE OCCASIONAL THUMP; SPEAKING VOICES ECHO IN THE CORRIDORS]
BASIRA
You’re sure she came through here?

ARCHIVIST
Have I steered you wrong so far?

BASIRA
I don’t know, do I? We haven’t actually found her yet.

ARCHIVIST
We’re getting closer.

BASIRA
Great.

MARTIN
Would you both just keep it down, please?

ARCHIVIST
They’re not aware of us, Martin. I keep telling you.

MARTIN
Yeah, I know, but it’s not okay to talk as though they’re not there. They’re still people.

ARCHIVIST
Uh… Technically, a lot of them actually aren’t people.

BASIRA
Come again?

ARCHIVIST
A-A lot of them are created by this place as, uh, set dressing, I suppose? This domain, the fear of it requires these… queues, these… this intricate hateful bureaucracy of hundreds of thousands of doomed souls. It needs far more than the number of people who actually ended up here.

MARTIN
Wait, wait, wait. So… so it just… makes the rest of them up?

ARCHIVIST
Er, maybe one in a hundred or so are actually real. The rest are there to make those people’s fears more acute.

MARTIN
That’s… ugh, that’s somehow more disturbing.

BASIRA
How do you tell which is which?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, you could ask me, I suppose. B-But I don’t really see the point. Would it help you to know whose suffering is real and whose is just a grim reflection?

BASIRA
No.

ARCHIVIST
Well, there you go then.

MARTIN
Why are they queuing?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, I mean, I’ve been keeping us away from those rooms, but… Well, it’s a factory of The Flesh, Martin. Use your imagination.

MARTIN
…

No. No, I don’t think I will.

ARCHIVIST
Wise.

BASIRA
So who’s in charge here?

ARCHIVIST
Not anyone you’re familiar with. We won’t be meeting them.

MARTIN
You’re not going to… y’know?

[MARTIN VOCALISES AN EXPLOSION]
ARCHIVIST
No. Even if I wanted to, he’s in the, uh… Main Processing Room. And believe me when I say that’s… not somewhere you want to be.

MARTIN
Yeah. I guess.

God, I hate all of these… loose ends.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

MARTIN
It’s fine. We’ll just have to tie them all up in one go.

ARCHIVIST
Hm?

MARTIN
Around Elias’ neck.

ARCHIVIST
Ah.

BASIRA
[Impatiently] Which way?

ARCHIVIST
Left. Just up ahead. Although… uh, um, actually, you might want to head through that door and wait.

BASIRA
Again? Already?

ARCHIVIST
There’s a lot of fear in this place.

MARTIN
What’s in there?

ARCHIVIST
Tool cupboard. Safe enough place to wait.

BASIRA
Fine.

[DOOR OPENS AND METALLIC JANGLING IS HEARD]
MARTIN
[Emphatically] Nope.

BASIRA
What the hell sort of tools are those?

ARCHIVIST
Flesh factory, remember?

MARTIN
New plan. We wait in the corridor. You go in the spike cupboard, and tell your story to all the hooks and stuff.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. Just don’t wander off.

[MORE METALLIC JANGLES AS THE ARCHIVIST ENTERS AND CLOSES DOOR]
ARCHIVIST
Hm. It could be worse. At least they’re clean.

[DEEP BREATH AS STATIC RISES]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Time has no meaning in this place, but that does nothing to lessen the certainty that Tyler has been in this line for years. A steady stream of sweat flows down his neck, staining his rough-weaved jumpsuit, and sticking the itchy material to the skin of his back. The heat of this place is intense, but more than that, it is the apprehension, the waiting, the inching step by step towards his own consumption. He wants to turn and run, to push past the endless row of desperate, weeping people and flee this place. But where would he go?

There is nowhere else, only the processing plant, and he’s heard the stories of what happens if you don’t get processed through the official channels. It’s messy and, more than that, they just throw the remains away. Nothing is used. And deep down, Tyler knows that’s what he’s for. He’s there to be useful, and the thought of running from that scares him as much as whatever is waiting for him at the end of the line.

Another person processed, another step forward on the snaking line of bodies. Tyler tries for a moment to remember how he got here, where he was before this room of noise and heat and patient, waiting figures. It’s faded now. He remembers aches and worries and, sometimes, something that might have been joy, but it’s far away now, like something seen projected on a distant wall.

[GRUNTS AND SOUNDS OF PAPER RUSTLING]
Another step forward, and he’s standing at a desk. The person behind it – is that a person? – wears a loose hood of coarse black leather. Below it they wear a featureless mask of the same material without a gap for eyes or mouth or even the shape of a nose. They wordlessly slide a form across to Tyler. His eyes travel down it: name, age, ethnicity, blood type, eye colour, body mass index, the list stretches on and on and on, and he can feel the stares of the thousands behind him burrowing into the back of his skull. He looks around, unable to find a pen, a pencil, anything. The thing sat behind the desk does not respond to his questions. Finally, Tyler takes his fingernail, now long and ragged from his time in the queue, and painstakingly scores the words into the paper. When one nail breaks, he uses another, until finally the information is carved into the thick white paper of the form. The thing behind the desk nods, just once, and points him to another line, even longer than the first. Tyler feels his stomach drop as he walks slowly over to join it.

This gradual procession of the doomed leads not to a desk, but to a small room, partitioned off from the wider floor of the facility. What happens within it is not clear, but the looks of apprehension and despair on the faces around him are even more pronounced than they were before. Once again Tyler considers briefly trying to run, but there’s nothing for it. Whatever the management has prepared for him at the end is what’s coming for him. All he can do is wait for the axe to drop.

And wait he does, as the minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into years, which mean nothing in the thick torpor of congealed time. Once or twice Tyler tries to engage those in front or behind him in conversation, but gets only panicked weeping in response. He is silent; his only companion, the heavy dread that is gradually expanding through his gut.

Another step and he is at the door to the small room. It is riveted iron, not rusty, but clean and polished to a sterile shine. The only smell is the smell of cleaning products. The door finally opens, and another thing stands there. It is dressed like the one behind the desk, but stood to its full height it towers over Tyler in its leather apron. It grips him firmly by the shoulder in hands with the weight and texture of granite, and leads him into the room of clean and burnished metal. He tries not to stare at the implements that hang on the wall as he is placed on a wide metal plate in the centre. He feels it yield slightly under his feet, and a weight appears on a screen set back into the wall. One of the things adjusting the equipment seems to become aware of this, though how it could have seen the measurement Tyler does not know, and it snatches the forms that he still carries from his hand. The noises that come from behind the mask seem to indicate the weight does not match what he has put down on his paperwork and, despite everything, Tyler is suddenly gripped with a panic that he might somehow be in trouble.

[MORE GRUNTING]
The disruption passes quickly and the things move on to other tests: poking, lifting, stretching his limbs, and assessing them with strange metal tools. Even if he had the will to, Tyler could not have struggled: the movements of the things scrutinizing him are as gently unstoppable as a piston. Finally, he is led over to a grate on the floor.

[SWIFT METALLIC NOISE]
He barely even has time to register the red-hot wire cutter before it is in and out of his left arm with practiced, professional ease, neatly removing a small wedge of muscle. There is almost a full second of numb confusion before the pain finally hits, and Tyler begins to scream.

The figures surrounding him do not seem to notice, instead fussing over the sample they have taken, examining it in minute detail, and silently conferring about it. Then they all nod at once, and the tiny chunk of meat is tossed away down a nearby disposal. One of them moves to the wall and picks up a long metal rod connected to an intricate arrangement of looping metal.

[METALLIC BUZZING STARTS]
Tyler is so preoccupied with the pain in his arm, he doesn’t notice the switch turn on, or the metal begin to glow red with heat. When the brand hits him in the small of his back, he has no idea what is happening.

[FLESH SIZZLES; MORE GRUNTING ENSUES]
The sensation is so overwhelming that it’s only after they push him out down a long metal chute and he finds himself at the back of another queue, he realises what has happened, as he sees the stamp of this place scorched into every back that stretches off into the distance.

This is the last processing line. Tyler can feel that truth deep inside him. There is no longer the wide open space surrounding them. Instead the head-height dividers lock them into single-file, snaking back and forth in a zig-zag as their path approaches the shining metal gate at the end. The ground is angled ever so slightly down, making it uncomfortable to stand still, and always gently urging them to move forward. At last, the prospect of seeing what might happen if he runs from the line seems worth it to Tyler, but the realisation sets in that it is far, far too late for that.

One step, then another, then another. The production balance of this place means it must be impossible for this line to be moving quicker than the ones before it, but it seems to press on with a determination that makes Tyler feel faint. The interminable dread of the wait has dissipated into a very present panic of reaching the end of this line, but with every scream it seems to accelerate. All too soon he is through the gate.

In the room before the killing floor there are three things. A mirror, a diagram, and a thick, black, permanent marker. Tyler stares at himself, a hundred thoughts running through his head as he waits his turn on the floor. He could refuse, a final petty act of rebellion against a system it feels like he has run through a hundred times. But what would be the point of that? It won’t save him. A wasted pile of discarded tissue is all that would be left. Is it not better, at least, to be useful? Tyler picks up the pen, and begins marking the cuts of meat upon his body. When he is done, he walks through the door.

[CRANKING METAL; A STUN GUN FIRES]
[GRUNTING AND CUTTING SOUNDS ENSUE]
The bolt goes through the back of his neck with a crack, and Tyler feels himself fall, paralysed, to the floor. It does not kill him, though, and he watches as his limp body is hoisted onto the butcher’s frame. They take their time as they disassemble him, making sure to let him see exactly what is about to happen at each step of the way. The last thing he sees before returning to the processing line, is everything going into the garbage. There wasn’t a single suitable cut.

“Useless,” one of the butchers says. And Tyler is gone.

– know you find it hard whe–

Done already?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Talking about me?

BASIRA
I assume that’s a rhetorical question.

ARCHIVIST
I am trying to keep my powers to myself.

BASIRA
Sure.

MARTIN
I was just… giving Basira some advice.

ARCHIVIST
[Good-natured] Avatars are from Mars and humans are from Venus, that sort of thing?

MARTIN
I mean… yeah, sort of?

[BRIEF CHUCKLE FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
Well, w-we were pretty much done anyway.

ARCHIVIST
Great. Well in that case shall we move on?

BASIRA
After you.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[WALKING OFF, MARTIN JOSTLES A BODY]
MARTIN
Excuse me.

ARCHIVIST
[Exasperated] Martin, they can’t hear you –

MARTIN
[Sharp] I know, John. That’s not the point.

ARCHIVIST
Alright.

[MORE WALKING]
Next one’s through here.

BASIRA
Next one?

ARCHIVIST
Her latest victim.

[DOOR IS WRENCHED OPEN WITH A METALLIC CREAK]
[MARTIN REELS, SOUNDS OF FLIES BUZZING]
Recognise her.

BASIRA
…

No… I don’t think I do.

ARCHIVIST
That wasn’t a question. It was an instruction. We can’t move on until you do.

MARTIN
John, what are you getting at?

ARCHIVIST
This isn’t just a journey through spaces.

BASIRA
…

Fine. I recognise her.

I don’t know her name, though.

ARCHIVIST
Isabelle Moran. Shoplifter, drug addict. Daisy was certain she was dealing as well. Derailed her recovery twice.

BASIRA
Fine. Noted.

Can we just move on, please?

ARCHIVIST
I’m afraid not.

BASIRA
Why not?

ARCHIVIST
We aren’t finished here.

BASIRA
Is that a threat?

MARTIN
Guys come on… don’t do this, not here.

ARCHIVIST
I told you before. We can’t hunt a monster you refuse to see.

BASIRA
Don’t give me that patronising, ominous-oracle bullshit, John. I’m not an idiot.

ARCHIVIST
I never said you were.

MARTIN
Guys…

BASIRA
[Angry] Look, I need you to lead the way. I don’t need your advice, and certainly don’t need you stood there judging me!

MARTIN
[Loudly] Enough. Enough! Someone has died! Show some respect. Or don’t you care?

BASIRA
[Incensed] Of course I fucking care!

…

[Quieter] That’s the problem.

MARTIN
I… I don’t understand.

BASIRA
I just… I don’t need him laying everything out for me like I’m some kind of idiot. I know, all right. Daisy is the only person I could ever rely on and… and she… she did things, terrible things and I… I refused to see it or… said it was my duty or whatever, I don’t know.

MARTIN
Basira…

BASIRA
I care, I just… I don’t need to wallow in it. I need to end it. All of it.

MARTIN
…

We’re here for you.

BASIRA
No. She was there for me.

ARCHIVIST
Cops vs. robbers and monsters…

BASIRA
I thought we were doing good. I really did. I knew there was some bad shit. I knew Daisy was into a lot of it, but… I thought it balanced out.

[Weakly] I thought we were good.

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] I know how that feels.

…

BASIRA
I wanted to help people, you know? When I first joined. Protect people. But then I saw what some of those same people were capable of, and… something changed. I wanted to hurt them, the ones that deserved it, and it… it felt good. It felt righteous.

I thought I could feel the line though. I really did. Eventually, though, it was too much… I was going to quit. I couldn’t take what I saw myself becoming. But… then I got sectioned, and suddenly… suddenly it turned out there were real monsters out there, and, well, that just made the power feel better. So things kept slipping. But Daisy was always there for me.

MARTIN
All those innocent people…

BASIRA
Were they? Innocent?

ARCHIVIST
Some. And if not?  What crime warrants what was done to them? Theft? Violence? Disrespect?

BASIRA
You knew her. She was trying to be better.

ARCHIVIST
She was.

But she never asked me to forgive her.

BASIRA
Forgive her?

ARCHIVIST
I’ve been scared, terrified for my life so many times these last few years. But I’ve never, not once, felt so horribly, abjectly, powerless as when she took me into that forest to kill me. I’ll never forget it.

MARTIN
You never said…

ARCHIVIST
It’s not easy to talk about.

MARTIN
Oh, John…

BASIRA
And would you have? Forgiven her?

ARCHIVIST
No. But she never asked me. She knew she had no right.

BASIRA
…

I really am going to have to kill her, aren’t I?

ARCHIVIST
There’s no way to bring her back. Not any more. At this point, if I tried to take away her fear… it would destroy her anyway.

BASIRA
Am I even going to be able to?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
And she stays dead?

ARCHIVIST
In this case, yes.

MARTIN
What about the powers?

ARCHIVIST
Dream logic, remember? She won’t come back. Trust me.

BASIRA
…

Does she want me to kill her?

ARCHIVIST
She asked you to, didn’t she?

BASIRA
No, I mean, right now? Is she suffering?

ARCHIVIST
…

No. Right now she’s… She’s happy.

[MARTIN REACTS]
BASIRA
Killing her won’t undo any of it.

But that’s not the point.

ARCHIVIST
No-one gets what they deserve. Not in this place. They just get whatever hurts them the most. Even me.

BASIRA
…

Can we move on now?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I believe we can. This way.

[FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL, TO A BACKGROUND CHORUS OF INDUSTRIAL FURNACE NOISE]
[DEEP BREATH AS THE STATIC STARTS TO RISE]
ARCHIVIST
Right.

[MACHINERY NOISE, LIKE CONVEYORS AND SCOOPS, AND THE FIERY PROCESSING OF WASTE ACCOMPANIES THE STATEMENT]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The heat of the furnace curls the hair on Derek’s arm. It burns in a way that is as familiar as it is stomach-churning, like the end of a cigarette, or the flush of a childhood face as it tries to block out the noises, the shame of being told to stop lying by the policeman who plays poker with his dad. He tried not to touch the metal parts of his small workspace, as it is hot enough to raise blisters. But everything is metal here. His spade is metal. His hammer is metal. The tracks are metal that lead the rusted metal carts towards his furnace.

This load is full of children’s toys. Not the sad and mouldy wooden ones he threw at his sister as a boy, but bright, colourful plastic that he recognises from his own daughter’s birthdays, Christmases… happier times. The sight fills him with dread. Where did they get these? What has happened to Tilly? He wants to run, disappear into the night calling her name, but he remembers what happened the last time he left his post, what the overseer took from him. His shovel digs into the pile of happy memories, and he tosses it into the flames, one gruelling motion after another. The burning plastic fumes hit him, and for a moment he staggers, reaching out a hand to steady himself. His palm sizzles as it comes to rest on the furnace, and he draws it back with a stifled yelp. He knows what happens in this place if you draw attention to yourself by screaming.

His shovel goes back into the pile, and meets an unexpected resistance. Something soft and almost spongy. He knows the texture well, and as he pulls the spade away, the bright blood on it confirms his fears. Another sharp sting of panic washes over him, electric pulses of fear causing his muscles to lock in place for a moment. Then he begins to load the furnace faster, frantically hurling away anything blocking the view of the body, desperately hoping to see –

It’s not her. It’s someone else. Derek doesn’t know the man who lies in the cart, lifeless eyes staring at him from a head split in two by a careless shovel-blow. He pauses for a moment, then goes to his task, hacking up the corpse, and loading it into the hungry flames. The smell hits him, sickening him as it always does, tinged with that cloying, greasy nostalgia.

‘I got you.’ That’s what Colin had always said to him when they were kids. And he had always meant it. When Derek needed somewhere to stay when his dad was on the warpath. ‘I got you.’ When Derek needed a little something to take the edge off. ‘I got you.’ When the lifeless body of Derek’s father lay at the bottom of the stairs, limbs folded around the cricket bat he had hit him with. ‘I got you.’

And Colin was right. He had.

Words can’t really express the gratitude Derek felt as the body disappeared into the furnace of the junkyard where his friend, Colin, worked. No, friend wasn’t a strong enough word. They were family in that moment. And they would always have each other’s backs. When the police came hassling them, he had Colin’s back. When some little dipshit didn’t show the proper respect, he had Colin’s back. When Colin needed someone by his side for a smash and grab, Derek had his back. And when one of them had to go down for three years… well, it seemed only fair.

The rumble of wheels on old metal rails brings Derek back to himself as he sees the now-empty, bloodstained cart rolling back and away from him. Disappearing into the field of red-hot glowing metal. Another one would be coming soon, rolling inevitably towards him. What part of his life would he have to burn then? What thing he loved would he have to hurl into the flames? The apprehension is as familiar to him as the scent of burning hair. He knows what it means to wait, and see what he has lost.

The first time he got out, he had lost his job and his home. The second time he got out, he had lost his daughter. The third time, he had lost the ability to walk the streets without being hounded by some bored cop, turning out his pockets, desperate for him to throw a punch. But it changed nothing. He always had Colin’s back.

Something is coming. Derek can feel it. It’s not the next cart, he knows that sound. It’s quicker, more vicious. Panting, snarling, bloody feet speeding quietly over through the heat of the yard. A hatred, a deep, self-righteous loathing charging before him.

[ANIMAL SNARLING, FOLLOWED BY RENDING VIOLENCE]
It is the sharp end of the violence that has wanted him all his life, and Derek has less than a second to recognise her face before she begins to tear him apart.

Another victim. Another hunt.

The pain and terror courses through him.

Derek is still aware as she toys with him, pulls bits from his torso, and chews them with a hundred sharpened teeth. He is aware – though not, perhaps, alive.

[STATIC RISES AND FADES]
[FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL]
BASIRA
She’s here, then?

ARCHIVIST
[Surprised] Basira? I… I-I didn’t hear you, uh…

BASIRA
No. I figured you wouldn’t when you were… busy.

ARCHIVIST
I thought you were keeping watch.

BASIRA
I was. Watched you sneak away.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

BASIRA
You apologise too much.

ARCHIVIST
[Chuckling] Martin says the same thing.

BASIRA
[Chuckling] Like he’s any better.

…

Why didn’t you want me to hear this one?

ARCHIVIST
What?

BASIRA
You weren’t this cagey about the other ones, meaning you wanted to keep this one secret.

ARCHIVIST
Uhh… Hm.

BASIRA
Because this one was Daisy’s victim?

ARCHIVIST
…

Yes.

BASIRA
…

Didn’t think you knew what the statement was going to be before it happened?

ARCHIVIST
I just had a sense of it.

BASIRA
So… what? You thought I’d hear he was a murderer, and I’d agree with her? Maybe I’d figure she was doing the apocalypse a favour by taking him out?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know what I thought.

BASIRA
Sure.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know, alright! I was… I was worried that if you listened, it might feel like an accusation. After everything we’ve already talked about, I-I mean… What good would it do for you to hear? What’s in this one that you don’t already know? “People have their reasons for doing wrong?” “The system hurts everyone?”

Just seemed kind of pointless.

BASIRA
Yeah. I guess.

ARCHIVIST
Honestly, I just wanted to avoid this conversation.

BASIRA
Should’ve been sneakier, then.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

…

Never been my strong suit, has it?

BASIRA
How many times have you been kidnapped at this point?

ARCHIVIST
That depends if you –

BASIRA
…

Say it.

ARCHIVIST
Depends if you count Daisy.

[TENSION & BREATHING]
So… You did hear it, then?

BASIRA
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
What, uh… What did you think? Did it… help?

BASIRA
With what?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know.

BASIRA
…

Me, neither.

[RUNNING FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL]
MARTIN
[Slightly breathless] Hey, she’s – she’s, she’s here!

BASIRA
What? Now?

MARTIN
Yeah, yeah, she… she just tore into a guy!

[Shaken] It was… He was, um…

ARCHIVIST
Yes, we understand, Martin.

BASIRA
You didn’t think this was worth mentioning!?

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t notice. I was talking to you!

BASIRA
Fine, whatever. Let’s go.

BASIRA
It’s fine. Shut up. I just need to focus.

ARCHIVIST
Alright.

[MEAT SOUNDS, AS DAISY REMOVES A LIMB; DISTRESSED MARTIN SOUND]
Take your time…

BASIRA
I will do as soon as you… Shut. Up.

[Hushed, angry] The hell was that!?

MARTIN
Sorry! Sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

ARCHIVIST
What happened?

MARTIN
I-I thought you were about to fire.

BASIRA
So you gasped, just in case?

MARTIN
Look, it’s a tense situation, alright? I don’t know what I’m doing here. I’m not a sniper –

BASIRA
Goddamnit.

ARCHIVIST
Basira, are you sure you’re up to this? It doesn’t need to be right now. W-We can always back off, regroup, wait for a better situation. One where she isn’t… elbow deep in some poor sod’s corpse.

BASIRA
Don’t do that.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

MARTIN
What am I missing here?

BASIRA
He knows as well as I do that the only reason we’re even able to get this close is because she’s busy with a kill. There isn’t going to be a better opportunity.

MARTIN
Now or never, then.

BASIRA
Yeah.

I made her a promise.

ARCHIVIST
You need to be certain.

BASIRA
I am.

[BASIRA TAKES AIM AGAIN, HESITATES AGAIN]
Would you stop staring at me like that?

ARCHIVIST
Like what?

BASIRA
Like you’ve looked inside my head, and you don’t like what you see.

ARCHIVIST
If that’s an accusation, then you’re wrong. I don’t do that.

[FEASTING SOUNDS STOP]
BASIRA
Right. Like you’re suddenly given infinite power and no consequences, and that’s when you decide to start respecting people’s privacy.

ARCHIVIST
Is that really so hard to believe?

MARTIN (BACKGROUND)
Uh…

BASIRA
Yeah, John. It is.

MARTIN (BACKGROUND)
Guys, guys…

BASIRA
If you have something you want to say, god-boy, just say it.

MARTIN (BACKGROUND)
Guys…

ARCHIVIST
Look. I know it’s hard and you have your reasons, but it is not my fault that you can’t bring yourself –

MARTIN
[Exasperated, hushed] Shut up! Both of you!

BASIRA
What?

MARTIN
She’s gone.

ARCHIVIST
Wait, what? Oh. Oh no.

BASIRA
Get down!

[DAISY LEAPS WITH A GROWL]

BASIRA
I know.

Daisy, come back to us. You can come back. Please.

What?

DAISY
Come. Got to get them.

I… Sure. Just… let him go.

Argh!

I’m sorry! Sorry! Sorry! You j– You need to keep pressure on that leg while I-I sort this…

BASIRA
Daisy, please.

John, can you… Can you do anything?

DAISY
Basira…

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry. I told you. She’s too… too deep. I can’t do anything, not without killing her.

BASIRA
[Pleadingly] Daisy. It’s me. Come on, please…

DAISY
Partner. C-Come.

BASIRA
…

[FAINT RISE OF STATIC]
Oh. I see.

ARCHIVIST
[Emphatically] Let her go.

MARTIN
…

ARCHIVIST
Is it… Is it awful that I wish she’d recognised me?

MARTIN
Daisy?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. I mean, she was… We were friends there, sort of, near the end. We went through so much and it just… I wish I could have actually said goodbye.

MARTIN
Would it have made you feel any better about any of it?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. Maybe? It’s hard to know how I feel about anything these days.

MARTIN
…

We said our goodbyes to Daisy after the institute. This was just… This was just dealing with all the stuff she left behind.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose.

[A BAG IS UNZIPPED]
MARTIN
Come on, I need to patch that leg up properly. The last thing we need is a limp slowing us down.

[WINCING FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
Of course, that’s assuming the bandages haven’t transformed into snakes or something.

ARCHIVIST
[Distracted] Hmm? No. No, they’re fine.

MARTIN
I’d forgotten we had them, to be honest. I packed them before I realised what a celebrity you were out here. I was starting to think I’d never need them. I’m surprised she could hurt you at all.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, that came as a bit of a shock to me as well, actually.

MARTIN
You didn’t know?

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t think to check. Just, sort of, assumed it was safe.

MARTIN
That’s a pretty big assumption, John.

ARCHIVIST
Hmmm. Apparently. I mean, I know it sounds strange, but it… it felt right for Daisy to be able to hurt me.

MARTIN
Dream logic again?

ARCHIVIST
Mmm. The… resonances from our relationship before the change carried over and –

[PAINED SOUNDS]
MARTIN
Hold still.

[RETURNING FOOTSTEPS]
MARTIN
How’re you doing?

BASIRA
[Weary] How do you think?

MARTIN
Sure.

BASIRA
I’m going to stay here. Burn the body.

ARCHIVIST
Of course. We can wait. I still need to, uh…

BASIRA
No. You go on. I’ll make my own way to London.

MARTIN
What? No, don’t be daft, it’s not a problem for us to wait while you deal with this.

BASIRA
Please. Just go.

…

MARTIN
Wait, seriously?

ARCHIVIST
Basira, if you travel on your own, if you’re not with us… I can’t guarantee your safety.

BASIRA
Good.

MARTIN
Basira, getting yourself hurt isn’t going to help anyone.

BASIRA
It’s just… something I have to do.

You said follow the tower, right?

ARCHIVIST
Right.

MARTIN
No, no, this is ridiculous. You could die.

BASIRA
I’ll do my best not to.

MARTIN
This isn’t a joke, Basira!

ARCHIVIST
Martin, this is what she needs.

MARTIN
No, no! It’s… it’s completely –

BASIRA
It’ll… It’ll help me. All going well, I’ll meet you both in London. He’ll know where to find me.

ARCHIVIST
So you won’t mind if I check up on you sometimes?

BASIRA
If you must. But don’t overdo it. I don’t like being watched.

ARCHIVIST
Understood.

Come on then, Martin.

MARTIN
What? So that’s it? We just head off, and hope you make it?

BASIRA
Yeah.

MARTIN
Why don’t we rest on it? Hmm? I know we all need a moment, and John can barely stand –

ARCHIVIST
Honestly, I’m starting to feel better already.

[THE ARCHIVIST STANDS]
I just need to stretch it out a bit.

[THE ARCHIVIST STRETCHES]

We’re not doing this.

Sorry, I just don’t want to lose sight of you. You keep disappearing behind tombs and that.

ARCHIVIST
I’ll try to slow down.

MARTIN
Thank you. I really rather not end up lost in a… what did you call it?

ARCHIVIST
Necropolis. It’s like a cemetery but all the tombs are above ground. New Orleans has a very impressive one. Or… had.

MARTIN
Hmm.

ARCHIVIST
It’s usually for places where the ground floods often or is too swampy for burial.

MARTIN
[Sarcastically] Pffft, oh yeah, yeah, I’m sure this place is just here because of all the flooding swamps.

ARCHIVIST
No, obviously. This place is a manifestation of –

MARTIN
No. Nope.

ARCHIVIST
I understand. Of course.

MARTIN
Sorry, I’ve just… I’ve been hearing altogether too many of your statements lately, and yeah –

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. No, no, I… I get it.

MARTIN
Just a little break.

ARCHIVIST
That’s fair enough.

MARTIN
In fact, this time, when you start to… intone, I’m going to find a nice soundproof mausoleum, and just, just chill with whatever horrors they’ve got lurking in there. Y’know. Maybe play a bit of I Spy or something.

[THE ARCHIVIST CHUCKLES]
MARTIN
I-I’ll start. I spy with my little eye, something beginning with… T–

ARCHIVIST
Tombs.

MARTIN

ARCHIVIST
[Indignant] I did not!

Fine. I spy with my little eye… Literally everything.

MARTIN
Yeah, yeah… Yeah. I’m… I don’t know. I’m not sure how to feel. Just… pressing on, you know?

I do.

MARTIN
…

Do you think she’ll be okay without us?

ARCHIVIST
She’s made it this far.

MARTIN
Yeah.

I just worry.

Me too. But I’m, uh, keeping an eye on her, so…

[HEAVY STONE SCRAPES AS A SARCOPHAGUS THUDS OPENS]

Is that…?

ARCHIVIST
It’s not for us. Let’s keep moving.

MARTIN
Yeah, alright, come –

Hey. Hey! I said slow down.

ARCHIVIST
S-Sorry.

MARTIN
How exactly does a leg wound make you faster?

ARCHIVIST
I just want to get through here quickly.

MARTIN
Really? I mean, it seems pretty calm apart from… Wait. Wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, no. It’s not more children, is it?

ARCHIVIST
No, no. The necropolis is fine. Uh, I mean, well, obviously it’s, it’s bad, i-i-it’s horrible…

MARTIN
S-So why the hurry? Where are we going?

ARCHIVIST
Er… well…

MARTIN
Come on, don’t play coy.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not being coy, it’s just, well…

MARTIN
Wait. Wait… are you excited?

ARCHIVIST
A bit. Maybe.

MARTIN
[Suspicious] Why? What’s next?

ARCHIVIST
[Excited] I don’t know.

MARTIN
In what way?

ARCHIVIST
All the ways. I don’t know what’s next.

MARTIN
What? But, like, you, you can see “literally everything,” so –

ARCHIVIST
I-I can! But it’s a blind spot! No idea why. I-I didn’t realise until we got closer, and I was looking at our route, but… I can’t see the area after the necropolis. None of it. It’s like the inside of the Panopticon, or, or wherever Georgie and Melanie are hiding.

MARTIN
Or Annabelle.

ARCHIVIST
…Or Annabelle.

MARTIN
You think the others might be there?

ARCHIVIST
[Delighted] I have no idea. It’s a mystery!

MARTIN
Just so you know, this… this is an adorable look on you.

ARCHIVIST
[Impatient] Yes, yes, yes, yes…

MARTIN
[Humouring] Alright, then. Lead on Scooby, let’s go solve a mystery, ooooh…

ARCHIVIST
Actually, no, hold on.

MARTIN
[Sighing] Of course.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry to be a burden.

MARTIN
Fine, fine. Just… stay in this… avenue while you do it. Don’t want to lose sight of you.

ARCHIVIST
Of course.

MARTIN
Not when there’s a mystery on the loose, oooh…

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

[FOOTSTEPS AS MARTIN BACKS OFF, AND THE STATIC RISES]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Away and around and away they stretch. Row upon row of waiting granite and watching marble. The names are carved with steady-handed reverence, and the dates do not make sense, but… bite your tongue. Read the epitaphs quietly to yourself in a respectful, solemn whisper: ‘loving son’, ‘noted philanthropist’, ‘honoured hero’, and do not question them out loud. For these graves, they are not silent – they are listening.

Stop a moment, and see the stone angels perched above you, staring down from the harsh corners of each mausoleum roof, looking out over the avenues of darkened, not-quite-moonlit, paving slabs, which buckle ever so slightly every step, as though the soil beneath is damp and yielding. Hungry. The angels have no expressions, their faces worn and pockmarked from the cold and vicious rain that finds the time to fall with disinterested cruelty at times upon their post. But the swords that each one carries do not wear, nor rust, nor blunt. They keep their eager vigil, desperate for a comment, a word, a breath out of place against which they might strike. Upon each blade the words stand out in stark and silvered letters: NIHIL NISI BONUM.

[FAINT FOOTSTEPS HURRY]
Walk faster now, pick up the pace, for not all the tombs are silent, not all the graves are at peace. Is that a voice, calling sweetly from beyond the iron gate, telling you that it has something to show you, secrets that it wishes to share?

[FAINT SOUNDS OF SONE SCRAPING]
Just knock and ask to enter. Or try your best not to hear, to think nothing but good and admirable thoughts of those who wait in monuments to their own virtue. There now, a face, pale and stained with age and death and sin, no, not sin, never sin. Misjudgement. Indiscretion. Misunderstanding. Never sin. Never evil. It grins and smiles and nods its head, with broken yellow teeth. It is a smile that wants you closer, wants you near. A bloated, purple tongue that tries to whisper reassurance, but can only gurgle promises that smell like sour fruit.

[GRAVEYARD SOUNDS AS THE WIND GUSTS, CHAINS CLINK, WOOD CREAKS]
How big is this place? How many miles of eerie edifice stand between you and freedom? Some doors lie cracked, shattered outwards, their occupants kept in check by ancient chains binding their brittle, bony limbs. Don’t go too close – keep to the middle of the narrowing alley. The stench that rolls from these broken crypts is unlike anything you have ever known, like lakes of fly-blown blood left to bake in the unrelenting sun. Keep it to yourself, though. Don’t mention it. No point making a scene. The angels wouldn’t like it. Besides, those are the tombs with the longest epitaphs, so they must have been good people.

Watch for the stones, the ones beneath your feet that sink and shift on the swampy ground. With every step their firmness seems more and more a question, and the cracks that cut across them grow deeper and deeper. Don’t step on the cracks, or goodness knows what will happen. And you are surrounded by goodness, are you not?

Your steps are as quick as respect will allow, and echo dutifully down the avenues. How much further to the gates? How much longer must you watch your every thought, lest it bring a sneer to your lips the angels might take as scorn. It must be close, simply turn at the next crypt and you should see it.

[DISTANT SOUND OF A CROWD MURMURING]
Wait. No. That isn’t right. There should be the gates, the threshold to leave these silent rows, but instead what rises in front of you is a house, tall and angular, with jagged peaks of darked wood, and windows from which no light escapes. It calls itself a home, but it lies. The funeral home houses only the passing congregations of sycophants and weepers, desperate to cleanse their own iniquities in the salt-tinged flood of gloating tears. You turn to walk away, to hurry back and disappear into the tombs that now seem almost welcoming, when behind you comes the inescapable, the inevitable sound of an old wooden door being opened.

[DOOR CREAKS OPEN]
‘Come in,’ the Funeral Director intones, ‘The service is about to begin. You are expected.’

The faceless gaze of each sepulchre angel fixes itself upon you, and you feel yourself turning back towards the house, though every muscle in your body screams at you to run. Instead you nod, and apologise for your lateness. The angels look away. And you step across the threshold.

The air smells of decay and lavender and something else you can’t quite place. The dust has settled over everything in layers so thick you dread to touch anything, to rest for even a moment, so keenly aware of the stark imprint you would leave, the marks of your presence, so deep and clear. A sign of life amongst the judgemental dead.

The Funeral Director does not comment upon your reluctance or care, though you know that nothing escapes his eyes. He leads you through the winding house towards the memorial room, the thick carpet crunching under your feet so loudly that it makes you wince, certain that it calls all attention to you. The Director’s steps are silent and dignified, the heavy fabric of his dark suit still and crisp as cold iron.

The mourners are all lined up so very, very neatly, four chairs either side, twenty rows deep. Each and every one in pitch-black funeral best, grey-haired heads bowed in respect, and a steady river of restrained tears flowing gracefully from under lace veils. There is no ragged breathing, no agonised wails of deep and wounding grief, only the respectful stillness of those who have lost a great figure, the best of them.

At the end of the room is the coffin, polished to a dreadful shine. There is no picture, no photograph of a smiling face casting beatitudes from beyond the grave. But the coffin is open, and from inside you can see the faintest hint of its occupant.

No. It can’t be her. That’s not right. It’s not fair. One hundred and sixty pairs of misty eyes follow your slow procession down the room, bile rising higher and higher with each row you pass. Fifteen left, you can make out her hair, still the cold grey you remember so vividly. Ten rows left, and you can see her mouth, those lips that hide the grin that now flashes thorough your memory. Five more, and you can see her eyes. Why are her eyes open? They are lustreless and clouded, but still contain the cruelty you saw when she held the knife.

Now you stand over her. There is no mistaking who it is that lies within that softly padded box. Beneath your threadbare suit and fear-stained shirt, the scars that lattice across your body ache and burn at the sight of the one who gave them to you. You feel the cross she once carved into your back open, and begin to weep its own bloody testament.

You need to leave, to turn and flee and find the end to this necropolis of polite denials and vicious civility. Your vision swims as you turn from the face of death, and find your arm grasped by the Funeral Director. His hand moves and you move with it, unable to stand against the unyielding strength of his simplest gesture. He places you behind the podium, as the mourners stare at you, and you realise with a stab of agonised dread that they are waiting for your eulogy, their faces alight with hungry grief.

‘If you would like to say a few words…,’ the Director commands.

You want to scream at them, curse them all for hypocrites. How can they not smell the blood she spilled? The path of scars and pain she left behind her every minute of her life? She was a monster, brutal and unrepentant.

‘She was…,’ you begin, a heavy pause before your voice betrays you. ‘The most kind and loving person I ever had the wonderful fortune to meet. Each life she touched was left brighter and more beautiful for her presence. She was… an angel.’

The tears are flowing freely now, as your eulogy continues. You cannot turn from the podium, cannot stop the gushing flow of love and forgiveness you vomit out into the nodding crowd. Behind you, a dark shadow moves, a shape that seems to slither from the coffin. You watch it coming closer from the corner of your eye, but you cannot stop your kind words. Not even as the needle-sharp teeth of her corpse begin to dig into your shoulder.

Is that…

ARCHIVIST
[Pleased] Looks like it.

MARTIN
No, no…

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
It… can’t be real?

ARCHIVIST
And yet!

MARTIN
But, but it’s… it’s…

ARCHIVIST
Yup!

MARTIN
It – It’s like something out of a National Trust brochure.

ARCHIVIST
I’m pretty sure it is National Trust. Was, anyway.

MARTIN
But you don’t know for sure?

ARCHIVIST
No. I can’t see anything about it. If I had to guess… Upton House, maybe? I mean, country houses and stately homes not exactly my specialist subjects.

MARTIN
But it’s… it’s fine. It’s better than fine. T-There are trees. Look! Like, real trees!

ARCHIVIST
It’s beautiful.

MARTIN
It’s a trap.

ARCHIVIST
[Still delighted] No! It might be a trap. We just don’t know!

MARTIN
John…

…

ARCHIVIST
[Resigned] Yeah, we’ll go around.

MARTIN
No… [Sigh] No, no, no. Let’s, let’s check it out. I mean, obviously it can’t be how it seems but… well…

ARCHIVIST
What if it is?

MARTIN
Exactly.

ARCHIVIST
A beautiful oasis, untouched by the end of the world.

MARTIN
It’s got to be worth a shot, right?

[BIRDS TWITTER]
ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

MARTIN
Don’t fret it. It’s just nice to see you like this.

[BIRDSOUND CONTINUES, CLEARER NOW]

So what now? I don’t see a doorbell.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not even sure this door actually opens.

MARTIN
But it should, it’s the front door! Besides, it’s the biggest one so if it’s not –

ARCHIVIST
Maybe they expect you to come in through the café or, I mean, they usually have a little gift shop or something.

MARTIN
Okay, so where would they be?

ARCHIVIST
No idea.

MARTIN
I thought you said you’d been here before.

ARCHIVIST
I said I might have been, and even if I have, I was twelve.

MARTIN
I’ll tell you what, it is more convenient when you know everything.

[SOUNDS OF A DOOR UNLOCKING]
ARCHIVIST
[Pleased] Oh! Guess I was wrong.

MARTIN
Get ready.

ARCHIVIST
To do what?

MARTIN
What do you mean “What”? Smite them. If we need to.

Wait, hang on, can you even smite people here?

ARCHIVIST
I-I don’t think so.

[DOOR OPENS, MUSIC CAN BE HEARD PLAYING]
MARTIN
Oh. Oh no… ah…

[FOOTSTEPS]
ANNABELLE
Good morning.

MARTIN
…

Uh… Yes.

ANNABELLE
Come on in. He’s waiting for you.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. And who exactly –

MARTIN
J-J-John… John…

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
I think… um… Annabelle? Annabelle Cane?

ANNABELLE
Come on. He’s very excited, you know.

[FOOTSTEPS AS SHE TURNS TO LEAVE]
MARTIN
So, do we follow or…?

ARCHIVIST
I… I suppose.

[THEY FOLLOW, DOOR CREAKING AS THEY CLOSE IT, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING AS THEY GO]
ARCHIVIST
So… Annabelle, what are you playing at? What are you doing here?

ANNABELLE
I really wouldn’t worry about that. I’m just helping out around the place a little bit. Making myself at home. You know how it is.

MARTIN
John, I don’t like this.

ANNABELLE
You can relax, Mr. Blackwood. You’re safe here.

MARTIN
I don’t feel it.

ANNABELLE
Not something I can help, I’m afraid.

MARTIN
Though… John, do you feel, huh, do you feel hungry?

ARCHIVIST
I, um… Actually, I was going to say I’m feeling… really tired.

ANNABELLE
Not surprising. When’s the last time you slept?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. I mean weeks ago. Months maybe.

ANNABELLE
Well, there you go, then.

Just in here.

[CLASSICAL PIANO MUSIC HAS BEEN GETTING LOUDER AS THEY APPROACH THE PARLOUR]

Hoo-hoo-hoo! Excellent! Come in, come in! Ah, a pleasure to meet both of you. Thank you Annabelle.

ANNABELLE
You’re quite welcome. Have fun.

ARCHIVIST
[Extremely tired] Sorry, Mikaele… Salesa?

SALESA
The one and only. I must say I’ve been, uh…

[THE ARCHIVIST AND MARTIN COLLAPSE WITH A SMALL SNORE, FAST ASLEEP]
ANNABELLE
I did say this might happen.

SALESA
You did, you did. Well. So much for my big reveal.

Shame. Ah, well, we can talk after they’ve slept, I suppose. Eugh. And had a bath. And some food. No rush. We have all the time in the world.

[DOOR OPENS]
MARTIN
Er… Mr… Salesa?

SALESA
Mikaele, please! Come in. Did you sleep well? Have you had something to eat? Annabelle said she’d shown you the pantry.

[SALESA CEASES THE MUSIC]
ARCHIVIST
[Uncomfortable] I…er… We slept. I-I don’t know – H-How long’s it been?

SALESA
About seventy-one hours, by my clock. How’re you feeling?

ARCHIVIST
Disorientated. It’s like, um, like I’ve lost my sight or, or –

SALESA
Well, you have, haven’t you?

[HE CHUCKLES. IT ISN’T THE FRIENDLIEST SOUND]
Annabelle tells me you work for The Eye.

ARCHIVIST
Well… I-I w-wouldn’t exactly say I-I ‘work for’ it.

MARTIN
Well… I-I-I mean, you say that, but when you stop to think about it, it was literally our employer, John, so…

ARCHIVIST
I-I suppose.

SALESA
[Friendly chuckles] I like this one. Come on, sit down, have a drink.

[CLINKING SOUNDS OF GLASS AND ICE]
MARTIN
You’re sure? What time is it? Oh. Huh. I can actually ask that question here.

SALESA
You can indeed.

MARTIN
And the sun’s high, so…

SALESA
Good eye… Martin, was it?

MARTIN
Er, er… Yes.

SALESA
Well Martin. It’s about ten in the morning. More or less.

MARTIN
And you’re drinking?

SALESA
Of course! Even in my little bubble of peace, I find drinking after dark leads to some rather morbid thoughts.

MARTIN
Right.

ARCHIVIST
What is… this place?

SALESA
I just told you, it’s my little bubble. My silver lining on an otherwise cloudy day.

ARCHIVIST
That’s not–

SALESA
Now tell me, do you know why there’s a tape recorder here? I noticed it just now, but I don’t believe I actually own one.

ARCHIVIST
Uh… Not really.

MARTIN
They sort of just … follow us round.

SALESA
Hmmmm. Interesting. Did you carry it in? Things shouldn’t be able to manifest in here like that.

ARCHIVIST
You had one in your… bag, I-I think, Martin? Did, did you drop it here?

MARTIN
Er, I don’t think so.

SALESA
Very well. In that case, we shall leave it to be. It’s hardly valuable, and it’s probably best not to upset whatever it might be involved with. Besides, I have no secrets to hide.

ARCHIVIST
So… you wouldn’t mind answering a few questions?

SALESA
…

I am an open book.

MARTIN
[Scoffs] In my experience, open books can actually be pretty dangerous.

SALESA
Ha! I do like this one! Now you mention it, you actually remind me of Jurgen a bit. In his younger days of course. You’re sure you won’t have a drink? We definitely had some tea around here somewhere?

MARTIN
Er, I, I already had some, thank you. Some of us know how to be polite guests.

ARCHIVIST
[Sharply] I don’t intend to accept anything offered by Annabelle Cane.

SALESA
Oh, you know Annabelle?

ARCHIVIST
Sort of. You do know she’s part of The Web?

SALESA
[Sarcastically] No, I assumed the thread holding her head together was due to a childhood knitting accident.

[CHUCKLES]
Of course I know she’s with The Web.

ARCHIVIST
And that doesn’t bother you?

SALESA
Not especially. And even if it did, what good would it do?

MARTIN
So what’s the deal with you two anyway?

SALESA
It’s an odd situation, but not a complicated one. Shortly after I decided to stay here, she arrived. Wandered in from the chaos out there, and told me she was going to stay with me. I didn’t get this far by pitting myself against The Web, so I welcomed her in.

ARCHIVIST
And…?

SALESA
And sometimes she cooks.

ARCHIVIST
She ‘cooks’?

SALESA
I don’t know what you want me to say. It’s a big house and I don’t see her much. Can’t even say which corner she’s made her nest in. Whatever she’s doing, all I can do is hope it doesn’t wreck my little oasis. And if it does, then I hope that by keeping her in good graces she’ll at least do me the courtesy of killing me first.

…

Anyway, let us talk of happier things. Or perhaps just take a moment to enjoy not being out there. You are, of course, welcome to stay as long as you like.

MARTIN
Th-That’s very generous.

ARCHIVIST
What is this place? How did you find it?

SALESA
[Slightly curt] I didn’t find anything. I made it.

ARCHIVIST
[Compellingly] Tell me what happened.

SALESA
No.

ARCHIVIST
I – uh… W-What?

[DEEP CHUCKLES FROM SALESA]
SALESA
The look on your face! Look, he’s so confused!

[MARTIN LAUGHS A BIT TOO]
ARCHIVIST
Martin!

MARTIN
Sorry. Sorry. Y-You did look kind of funny. It was l-l-l-like you were flunking an exam or something.

[MORE CHUCKLING FROM SALESA]
SALESA
Yes! Exactly that! Your powers won’t work here, Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. The Eye can’t see this place.

ARCHIVIST
So, what now?

SALESA
Ah, no need for the suspicion, I’m not going to hurt you. You’re quite safe. I’ll tell you soon enough. Like I said, I have no secrets. But it will be in my own time.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

SALESA
You know, Gertrude once used that little trick to ask if I was trying to sell her a forgery. Admittedly I was, so I don’t hold a grudge, but I didn’t much care for the experience. Anyway, for now, just relax, and no doubt I’ll get there eventually. I haven’t had anyone to talk to properly in months.

MARTIN
I thought… what about Annabelle?

SALESA
She keeps mostly to herself, and when she does talk, it’s usually more of the sinister monologue variety, or cryptically telling me I’ve got ‘guests’.

MARTIN
Er, yeah, that sounds familiar.

ARCHIVIST
I’m trying to be less cryptic.

MARTIN
I-I know, I know.

SALESA
So what’s it like out there? I assume the Archivist must be rather a powerful position, since you seem to be travelling through it pretty freely.

ARCHIVIST
It’s… uh… um…

MARTIN
John?

ARCHIVIST
Sorry I just, er… Hmm.

MARTIN
I-It’s bad. Really bad. It’s all carved up between the powers, and everyone has just been, sort of scooped up, and chucked into their deepest fears. Just nightmare after nightmare after nightmare, and, er…

Why are you smiling?

SALESA
I’m sorry, you’re quite right – it’s inappropriate. It’s simply… I have spent the last decade preparing for this to happen. Not just something like this, but almost exactly this situation. There was every chance, in fact the great likelihood, that I was wasting my time, and throwing away years of my life on a ridiculous precaution. But I was right.

I. Was. Right.

And now here I am, safe, warm and comfortable while out there the whole world screams. I don’t mean to sound… a-as if I’m happy that people are suffering –

MARTIN
Good, ‘cause it does sound a bit like that.

SALESA
Then I apologise. I’m just not sure I can fully communicate the sense of… of vindication that I feel. All those long nights I spent wondering if I was paranoid or overreacting… But no. I am here. And I am safe.

MARTIN
I mean… I guess that makes sense.

SALESA
So what of you two? What… Wh-Where are you going? You seem to be travelling with some purpose.

ARCHIVIST
Did Annabelle not tell you that?

SALESA
She said you were travelling to the Tower. The Panopticon, she called it, whatever that might be. She didn’t say what for.

[Suspiciously] Nothing that might cause me trouble, I hope?

MARTIN
We’re going to try and end this. Turn the world back.

ARCHIVIST
Martin!

MARTIN
What? Okay. Maybe he can help. We could use some support. And it’s, it’s not like he wants the world to stay like this either.

SALESA
You are right, to a point. I would welcome a return to the real world. Ha! To be the only man to weather the greatest disaster in history of reality utterly unharmed. What an achievement that would be, quite the boast. But alas no, I can’t help you.

MARTIN
What? Why not?

SALESA
I have nothing to offer. Well, except perhaps for some… basic provisions. I have food, drink, a few luxuries. But none of that would help you out there. And I’m certainly not going to follow you. No, I think the best thing I can do is to welcome you to stay in my sanctuary as long as you wish.

MARTIN
Oh, well, thank you. I think we just might. John?

ARCHIVIST
I can’t use my powers here. I-I can’t protect us.

MARTIN
Protect us from what?

ARCHIVIST
I-It’s going to be difficult to relax with a spider lurking around.

SALESA
It gets easier with practice.

ARCHIVIST
…

Alright, I-I guess we can stay. Just for a bit.

SALESA
Excellent! I haven’t had guests since the world ended!

ARCHIVIST
[flat] Lovely.

SALESA
Oh, saying that, I suppose there was that insect thing that stumbled in here a month or so back…

MARTIN
Er, insect thing?

SALESA
Some creature of the Crawling Rot. Anyway, it didn’t actually make it into the house before Annabelle managed to get rid of it, so I refuse to count it as a guest.

MARTIN
Mmm.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose that makes sense.

SALESA
Of course, I can’t actually stop things crossing the border into my hideaway, as you both discovered. Another reason I’m content to leave Annabelle to whatever schemes she might be weaving.

ARCHIVIST
How big is your safe zone? Is it, is it always the same size? How did this happen?

SALESA
[Chuckling] Look at him. Not three days without his master spooning knowledge into his head, and he can’t bear it! I thought ignorance was meant to be bliss.

[SOUND OF A FRUSTRATED ARCHIVIST]
MARTIN
F-F-For what it’s worth, I’d also quite like to know how this all happened.

SALESA
Fine, I’ll tell you how it happened. But you must sit quietly while I tell you.

MARTIN
Don’t worry, I have had lots of practice.

SALESA
And you?

[SOUND OF A DISGRUNTLED ARCHIVIST]
MARTIN
He’ll behave.

SALESA (STATEMENT)
My story is not a long one. Not the parts that you care about, at least. The powers, I first learned about from Jurgen Leitner. You’re familiar with him? Then I don’t need to explain further. When I say I was one of his assistants, you know exactly the kind of education that would be. Terrifying, fascinating, misguided. The man was a genius and an idiot. It didn’t take me long to see what he was blind to his whole life: that trying to control the Fears was a good way to get yourself killed, or worse.

I left long before he got what was coming to him, and tried to forget what I knew. I lived my life, and I lived it well, Successful, wealthy, and a little bit feared. Smuggler to the rich and famous. There wasn’t an art dealer or curator out there who didn’t pretend not to know me. But the trouble is, once you’ve seen backstage, it’s hard to believe in the show anymore. You understand, I’m sure. You can never quite shake off the desire to have a peek. To see what’s waiting in the wings.

When I first stumbled across one of the cursed objects, I recognised what it was immediately. It took the form of a leather pouch, filled with 1888 Morgan silver dollars. It was aligned to The Slaughter and… well, let us call it ‘blood money’ and talk no more of the grisly details. Selling them, well, it went very badly for the buyer…

But not for me. I walked away unharmed, and with a healthy profit and counted myself lucky. And then it happened again. This time it was a painting: a drab English pastoral that pulled you into The Lonely. Again, I made a lot of money and remained untouched. It’s the sort of thing to set a man thinking about his life, you understand?

I began to think hard about the world, about my place within it, and about fear. About the figure of the merchant, the trader who deals in strange and dangerous goods, how it can be found in so many myths and fables, dealing in second-hand nightmares. And how rarely the merchant themself is ever punished in those stories.

I would love to pretend that it was out of self-preservation that I committed to my new trade, but that would be mostly a lie. To tell you the truth, I got a real kick out of playing my role. To think of myself as a purveyor of curses, walking softly through the most dangerous edges of reality so that the rich and arrogant could buy their own doom. Sometimes people would come to me for solutions, protections or talismans to ward off the attention they had already called down on themselves. I sometimes did what I could to help, but I had to be careful. I could never afford to forget who I actually was working for. And do you know what? I managed to walk that tightrope for decades without falling.

You know, I think there were times when I was perhaps skirting close to The Stranger, but I kept my name prominent and, well… [chuckles] I’m not exactly a small personality. Anonymity just wouldn’t have suited me.

But the years, they wear on you, and as I talked to more and more people versed in that secret world, more acolytes and would-be cultists about rituals and destinies, I began to come to a conclusion. As the number of people in the world grew, and the amount of fear grew with it, I began to become convinced that it was only a matter of time before one of them succeeded. Before the world was transformed into… Well, you’d know better than me.

So I began to plan for my… retirement. I spent most of my fortune preparing. Some on supplies, but mostly hunting down an artifact that I hoped might give me some… protection. One I had sold right at the start of my career: an old broken camera. One that through some quirk had the ability to hide you from the Powers. It was in the possession of another scared old man, one who had long been running from his own supernatural debts. I believe it operates as a sort of, er, battery, charging itself on all the quiet worries that come from living in hiding, and then when the sanctuary collapses, all that fear flows out at once. No doubt, if my oasis breaks before I die, The Eye will get quite the feast from me, but in this new world I would hope it has other things to keep itself busy. Anyway, it took a lot of resources to find it again, and even more to retrieve it. Staging my death was a comparative, erm, afterthought – in some ways just a happy accident.

And so I waited, and lived out my days in comfort. For the longest time I thought that, well, maybe I had simply entered normal retirement really dramatically. But then… well… I was right.

I. Was. Right. Both about the world and about the camera. It hid me from The Eye, which, in the new order of reality, also protects where I am from the hellscape all around us. And when I realised that the power moves with the camera… Well, let’s just say I loaded up a truckload of supplies, and went on some journeys of my own before I found this place.

[MORE CLINKING GLASS AND ICE]
No reason not to live out the apocalypse in style.

[STIRRING NOISES]
In the end, I find myself quite happy. I have supplies for a good few years, and then I plan to take my own life. I think perhaps that’s the greatest blessing the camera can bestow. I can die here. Escape this place. Not yet, of course, and maybe the wine will do me in before I have to take matters into my own hands, but still, it remains a comfort.

Anyway, no more stories, I think. Let us relax, and talk and drink. And not worry about who might be… listening.

MARTIN
You’re sure we can’t stay longer?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I-I-I’ve been…um… Er, these last few days I’ve been getting weaker. Dizzy spells, vagueness. You’ve seen it.

Being cut off from the Eye… It’s not good for me.

MARTIN
Yeah, but if, if you’re that connected, that dependent, what happens if we actually, y’know, do manage to –

ARCHIVIST
We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, I just need us to be moving on.

[FOOTSTEPS, AND A DOOR CREAKS OPEN]
ANNABELLE
All packed?

ARCHIVIST
Mm.

MARTIN
Oh! Finally showing your face?

ANNABELLE
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.

MARTIN
Pffft. All week you scuttle around with… with food and drinks and all that other stuff, whatever we need, just when we need it, but if we actually try to talk to you, you’re gone.

ANNABELLE
[Smilingly] I’m very busy.

ARCHIVIST
Martin, don’t bother. We’re not going to get any answers out of her.

MARTIN
Y-You’re joking right? She’s been lurking at the edges of this whole thing since the beginning, and now we can finally actually talk to her, and, what, you’re just going to pass? You don’t have any questions? Nothing at all?

…

John? John!

[MARTIN CLICKS HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF THE ARCHIVIST]
ARCHIVIST
[Distant] Wha… Oh, yes… sorry.

Look, it’s no accident we finally meet face-to-face in the one place I-I can’t get any answers out of her.

ANNABELLE
[Smug] I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.

MARTIN
Why are you here? Hmmm? What’s your game?

ANNABELLE
Perhaps I just value my privacy.

MARTIN
Fine, fine. Why did you call me before?

ANNABELLE
Perhaps I thought you could use a friendly voice?

MARTIN
Friendly!? You told me John didn’t need me!

ANNABELLE
Objectively true. And more importantly, perhaps I thought that you might need a little bit of righteous indignation to help you power through the next steps.

MARTIN
I don’t like being manipulated.

ANNABELLE
Then we probably aren’t going to be friends.

[SOUND OF FRUSTRATED MARTIN]
For what it’s worth, I’m sorry. The call was… clumsy. There are so many things to keep track of at the moment. I must confess it did perhaps lack my usual… nuance.

ARCHIVIST
And perhaps you’re now just trying to humanise yourself so we underestimate your next move.

ANNABELLE
Perhaps.

MARTIN
…

So… So that’s it, then? We-We’re just going to leave her here?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
We could make her tell us.

ARCHIVIST
No, we couldn’t. I don’t have my powers, and if it came to a physical fight I really don’t rate our chances.

MARTIN
Hey, I can handle myself!

ANNABELLE
But can you handle me?

MARTIN
…

I don’t like you.

ANNABELLE
I know.

MARTIN
God… Fine. Fine!

[BAG IS GRABBED]
Come on, John.

ARCHIVIST
[Vague] Oh… I’m sorry, what?

MARTIN
We’re leaving.

ANNABELLE
Don’t worry, Martin. We’ll meet again. Hopefully when you’re feeling a little bit more… open-minded.

MARTIN
I wouldn’t count on it.

ANNABELLE
I would.

ARCHIVIST
That’s the trouble with old houses, I suppose. Full of spiders.

ANNABELLE
You boys better take care of yourselves. I’m sure we’ll see each other again very soon. Here, why don’t I show you out.

ARCHIVIST
Fine.

[FOOTSTEPS PROCEED THROUGH THE HALLWAYS AND DOORS OF THE MANOR]
SALESA
Ah, you are off, then?

[FAINT SOUNDS OF MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND]
ARCHIVIST
Yes, uh…

MARTIN
Thank you for all your hospitality.

SALESA
You are sure you won’t stay a little longer? You’re more than welcome.

ARCHIVIST
No. I… uh… got to, um, leave.

MARTIN
What he said.

SALESA
Ah, such a shame. And you’re sure I can’t give you a little something for the road? Food? Wine?

MARTIN
Er, no, thank you. [Sighs] Nice things, they… tend not to stay nice out there.

SALESA
True enough. Well, best of luck I suppose. And if, in the end, you can’t save the world… you know where I am.

ANNABELLE
Actually, he doesn’t.

[SALESA CHUCKLES]
SALESA
Ah, of course. What a shame. Well, then I guess it really is goodbye. Travel well. Don’t be Strangers!

Feeling better?

ARCHIVIST
Um… yeah. I’m afraid I am.

MARTIN
Alright.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry. It would have been nice to stay.

MARTIN
[Wistfully] Yeah.

I’d almost forgotten what it was like, you know? A bit of peace.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, you could have –

MARTIN
No, don’t say it, John. You know I never would. I c-can’t just forget all the people out here. Besides, I’d rather be trapped in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with you than spend one more moment in paradise with her.

ARCHIVIST
[Smilingly] That might just be the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.

MARTIN
Yeah, yeah. Come on. We’ve got a job to do.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose we do.

[FOOTSTEPS HEAD OFF ACROSS SOFT GROUND]
Pity.

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
It’s, er… going away. That peace, the safety, the memory of ignorance…

MARTIN
That’s… Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Do you remember any of it? W-What Salesa said? Annabelle?

ARCHIVIST
Some, I think. It’s, uh… Do you mind filling me in?

MARTIN
Wait, you need me to tell you something for once?

ARCHIVIST
I guess so. It’s, er… It’s gone. Like a dream.

What was it like?

Nice. It was… It was really nice.

Seriously?

ARCHIVIST
Yup.

MARTIN
Not an hour from an oasis, and we’re already at sinister hospitals?

ARCHIVIST
It’s the next stop on our journey.

MARTIN
Of course it is. And, of course, there’s no chance for a warm-up?

ARCHIVIST
[Incredulous] A warm-up?

MARTIN
Yeah, y’know. Something a bit more… manageable. A-A chance to get our bearings a bit first.

ARCHIVIST
What exactly did you have in mind?

MARTIN
I dunno. Y’know like, like a creepy… bus stop or something?

ARCHIVIST
[Amused] I’m afraid not.

Truth be told, I’m actually feeling pretty great.

…

Which isn’t necessarily a good thing, I suppose.

MARTIN
Yeah, I know.

[SIGH]
We stayed in Salesa’s as long as you could.

ARCHIVIST
A bit longer, actually. I was, er… not really holding it together by the end.

MARTIN
Why didn’t you say something?

ARCHIVIST
It’s fine. I’m fine.

MARTIN
Yeah, now.

ARCHIVIST
I just thought, what with Daisy and Basira, and… You needed a break. Some time to process.

MARTIN
We both did. But apparently I’m the only one who got to.

ARCHIVIST
It’s okay. I deal with things differently these days. I just wanted to make sure that you were doing okay. Was I wrong? To hold off?

MARTIN
…

No. No you weren’t. Just getting the chance to sleep again was…

Ah well. Good while it lasted. Come on then, ‘nightmare hospital’ it is.

ARCHIVIST
Would it help if I told you we were actually starting to get a bit closer to London? Well, what was “London”.

MARTIN
Actually, yes. That does help a bit. How many more?

ARCHIVIST
Depends on, uh… A few, at least.

Right.

Martin, be polite.

Hello!

DR DOE
A pleasure yes hello. I am Doctor Doe, Jane. Welcome into my hospital, Inspector.

ARCHIVIST
Inspector?

DR DOE
You have come here to over-observe yes? To inspector?

ARCHIVIST
I, uh, I s-s-suppose so. Y-Yes.

DR DOE
Then follow. Let us tour our wellbeing centre. Keep your screams inside if you want to be polite.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[Nervously] It’s a… Beautiful building.

DR DOE
Do not insult me.

MARTIN
I, uh… okay.

W-What’s it called?

DR DOE
Called?

MARTIN
The hospital.

DR DOE
Ah. St. Bleedings Centre for Wellbeing.

MARTIN
[Drawled] Right.

ARCHIVIST
[Hushed] Martin, keep your eyes forward. On the doctor.

MARTIN
[Hushed] Seriously? She’s all kinds of horrible –

ARCHIVIST
Better than what’s in the rooms. Trust me.

MARTIN
Right.

DR DOE
You must look in here to see one of our four hundred operating theatres where we ensure any wellbeing is swiftly and awfully dispatched.

MARTIN
[Hurriedly] Right, right

DR DOE
Sometimes is an anatomical wellness. Sometimes the wellbeing they possess is mental. In both cases we have grinding machines and anti-trained doctors on nails to deal with it. Nobody who comes into the hospital leaves right. Or at all.

MARTIN
Oh. Heh. Gooooood.

ARCHIVIST
Good lord.

DR DOE
It is a thing to look at isn’t it? How much do they suffer, Inspector?

ARCHIVIST
I… What?

DR DOE
I help to cure them of their wellbeing but… I cannot know if my work is appreciated. I can only guess at fear. You know. Does it work? Do they… hurt?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Yes they hurt.

[NOISE OF CONTENTMENT]
DR DOE
This pleases me.

MARTIN
Is there… Uh, is – is there anything here that isn’t surgeries?

DR DOE
There are all sorts of machines. Plenty of medicine.

MARTIN
Any, uh… wards? Beds, maybe?

DR DOE
Sometimes rooms. Sometimes we throw them in a pit.

MARTIN
A pit, right, yeah.

DR DOE
We have a canteen.

ARCHIVIST
[Hushed] Don’t ask about the canteen

He is a janitor. You are allowed to ignore him.

[FAINT CRACKLE OF STATIC]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Patient: Jeremy W.

Date and place of birth: 4th August 1977, North Manchester General Hospital

Date and place of last contentment: 8th July 2013, sunrise, on Arthur’s Seat hilltop, Edinburgh

Complaint: Generalised pain and creeping ennui

Surgical procedures thus far: 802.

Prognosis: Delightful

They always wore masks when they stood over his bed, those thin blue, or were they green, surgical masks, but they somehow covered the entire faces of the doctors and the nurses and the orderlies that swarmed in and around him. Jeremy didn’t know how they could see with their eyes covered, but it was a long time since he had realistically thought there might be anything human behind the medical garb. They wore loose, baggy scrubs, head-coverings that gave no sign of hair, and thick, waterproof aprons.

[STRETCHING RUBBER NOISE]
Whenever they were about to touch him, they would snap on another vinyl glove over the layers and layers of similar gloves that would have long since cut off all the blood to their hands. If they had any.

There was no way to tell the time here. The window in his room grew bright and dark, but the light was wrong for the sun. At some point he’d broken the glass in a desperate attempt to escape, but was confronted by a fluorescent light installed in front of a brick wall. He had tried to count how long it was on for and how long it was off, but it seemed almost random, and the pain grew worse when he tried to keep track of time.

At some point in each lighted time, they would come, unlocking the rusty iron door of his hospital room, and surrounding his bed three-deep. Some were tall and narrow, others wide or crooked. None of them were quite the right proportions to be convincingly human. They mumbled among themselves, meaninglessly saying words like ‘intubation’, ‘radiology’ or ‘stat’. Occasionally one of them would touch him. The strange texture of their bodies was clear even through all the layers in which they hid. Eventually, one of them – and it was always a different one – would push to the front. ‘I am the doctor,’ it would say, ‘are you well?’

[THESE MOVEMENTS, THROUGHOUT THE STATEMENT, ARE ACCOMPANIED BY FAINT, UNPLEASANT SQUELCHING SOUNDS]
This was it, the moment of truth, the point at which all Jeremy’s anxiety came to a head. They all leaned in, hidden faces focused on him, as though drinking in his desperation. He had to make an answer, a simple yes or no. He’d learned the hard way that nuanced answers or stoic silence only made it worse.

So he picked one. A roll of the dice. In many ways, it didn’t matter which he chose, as there was no way to determine if the doctor of the day considered his wellness an aim to be achieved, or a condition that required curing.

‘Yes,’ he might say. ‘I am well.’ And if he had chosen right, the mask would widen as though the face behind it extended in a smile. ‘Wonderful!’ would come the response, ‘keep it up!’, and the crowd would file out and lock the door behind them, leaving Jeremy to wait for his next assessment.

But he rarely seemed to choose right. The rest of the time, a shudder of anticipation would pass through the medical things around him. ‘Well, let’s see what we can do about treating that,’ the doctor would say. And they would descend upon him, and drag him away for treatment.

[UNPLEASANT NOISES INTENSIFY AS A METAL DISH HITS THE FLOOR]
[A CURTAIN IS DRAWN BACK ON RUSTY RINGS]
[FAINT SOUNDS OF HOSPITAL MACHINERY AND VELCRO]
Patient: Renee T.

Date and place of birth: 27th November 1990, Royal Hallamshire Hospital

Date and place of last contentment: 27th November 2015, birthday party prior to father’s stroke

Complaint: Facial paralysis

Surgical procedures thus far: 560

Prognosis: Exciting

She always thought she hated the diagnosis the most. Those long, excruciating minutes of probing and poking, of temperature taking and needles drawing blood and mucus and tears and black bile and yellow bile all to be tested and tasted and twisted. A dozen staff flapping around her like carrion birds, stealing a little bit more of her each time for their own clumsy guesses and painful assumptions.

All the while the dread was building, focusing to a hot, tight little ball that settled just below her stomach and shot it through with agonising reminders of her fear. Her face, of course, remained impassive, unable to show her mounting dread.

Finally, one of the creatures would step forward, never one she recognised, and announce the diagnosis. ‘Skin,’ it might say, or ‘liver’, or ‘bones’, and once, only once, ‘soul’. Then the treatment would begin.

[A CURTAIN IS DRAWN AGAIN]
[A STRAP IS TIGHTENED]
Surgery was the most common treatment, and one for which the doctors often reached. Renee would be strapped down tighter to her chair, and wheeled into the lift that smelled like ammonia and rot. It would descend far, far down into the belly of the hospital, before she was wheeled down the longest corridor in the building, barely wide enough to fit her trolley. The soon-to-be surgeon walked in front, whistling a tune that never resolved itself into a melody. Finally, she would be placed in the centre of the theatre, bright lights rendering the rows upon rows of silently watching doctors nothing but silhouettes.

[MORE STRAPS FASTENED AND A FAINT BUZZING BEGINS]
Sometimes there was enough anaesthetic to lock her limbs in place; other times they simply let her thrash. It dulled the pain, but the pain was never the problem. Regardless, they always strapped the anaesthetic mask tight to her face before they began to cut. The procedure varied depending on the diagnosis.

[VISCERAL SOUNDS OF SURGERY]
An organ diagnosis was simple: open her up, dig around inside her until they could remove something that could conceivably be a liver or a pancreas or a gallbladder, then put something back in its place. Sometimes what they put in was hard and sharp, digging into her when she tried to move; sometimes it was soft and putrid, and she could feel it rotting away within. Occasionally it was alive, and she could feel it clawing to get out. When the diagnosis had been skin, they had peeled her piece by piece before they painted the inside of it with something dark and sticky, then sewed it back on. All through she could do nothing but watch as they cut and swapped and conjectured her body, unable to speak, to move, to do anything but watch these anonymous things play with everything she was.

But worse, perhaps, were the medicines. If they prescribed her medicine, she tried her best not to take it, but the pills would crawl down her throat when she wasn’t paying attention, and the solutions would pour themselves in her ear when she lay down to rest. They might have done nothing, been naught but dust and sugar, but she could never be sure. The sickness, the seizures, the spasms, the sadness. If it wasn’t the medicine, then it was inside her. And it had always been inside her. And she just didn’t know.

[MACHINERY NOISES FADE AWAY]
[FAINT SOUNDS OF METAL AND HEAVY BREATHS]
Patient: Kelly M.

Date and place of birth: 1st April 1982, Bournemouth Hospital

Date and place of last contentment: Not recalled

Complaint: Headaches

Surgical procedures thus far: 220

Prognosis: Unwise

In her locked and darkened room she waited for the doctors to come. She looked to the small strip of fluorescence that spilled beneath the door, but nothing disturbed it. When would they come? When would they give her her next treatment?

The last doctor had told her it was her heart. They had rushed her down to the theatre, and tore open her chest something that looked like a pastry crimper and reached inside. Her bile rose at the memory of those strange boneless fingers brushing against her lungs. Then they had gripped something, and pulled it out of her slowly and… almost tenderly. Kelly remembered it had at first looked like a child, a baby, but it had her face, and stole away her smile. She didn’t see what they did with it, but in its place they put a cold and glassy thing, a frozen tube that beats and pumps out ice water that makes her shiver all through the deepest parts of herself.

It still pumps now, as Kelly sits shivering in the corner of her room.

How long has it been? There is no way to tell, not here, but they will come back, they must come back. They always do. They must swap out this cold and hollow emptiness for some fresh pain and torture. She longs to feel the pain, as it is at least a feeling. But the fear has grown inside her now. What if the doctors are finished? What if she is treated, and this is all that there is now? What if she is well? Kelly looks to the door and waits.

Hmm. Hope’s dead. Bit on the nose, isn’t it?

He hasn’t been bothering you, has he Martin?

Naturally.

So you’ve come to me.

BREEKON
Didn’t mean to.

No, but you have. Because there’s something you want. Isn’t there?

BREEKON
…

Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Say it.

BREEKON
…

Kill me.

MARTIN
Wait, what?

BREEKON
The way I figure, you’re the one that made all this. So if anyone can end it, you can. Can you do it?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I can.

MARTIN
But, but like, why would you want him to? Isn’t this whole thing like a dream come true for all of you… monsters?

BREEKON
You think I dream of mopping floors? No. We’re – I’m a delivery man. We arrive somewhere, deliver terror and death, then leave, never to be seen again. Not much call for that now everyone’s in their little kingdoms. Maybe if we were complete, we could’ve done something, but as is… No. Can’t say I want this to be my forever.

ARCHIVIST
I see.

BREEKON
Besides, it hurts all the time. The Eye won’t ever stop watching, and [sigh] it ain’t great for an anonymous thing like us… like me.

ARCHIVIST
Very well. I warn you, though, it will hurt.

Right.

Good luck.

Probably not.

I don’t really know how to feel about that.

ARCHIVIST

MARTIN
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST

Me, neither. I didn’t enjoy it, but… I dunno, almost felt like doing a favour for an old friend.

No, no, it was. I just… I dunno, I… you did the look and… It’s fine, sorry. What, what’s the deal, though? Parts of it almost look like –

ARCHIVIST
The Institute.

MARTIN
Yeah.

THE ARCHIVIST
Yes.

It makes sense. After all, it was built on the ruins of what Robert Smirke constructed.

MARTIN
Smirke?

…

What? No. But, but, surely he’s –

ARCHIVIST
Dead? Yes. Very much so. This place is… an homage, shall we say. A monument. To him and those like him, who tried to… categorise the world with themselves at the centre. In so doing, constructed the architecture of its suffering.

MARTIN
Bit of a mouthful.

[DOOR OPENS]

MARTIN
[Weary] Hello Helen. Might have guessed you’d be into weird architecture. Very much your area of expertise, no?

HELEN
Hmm, depends. Would you describe ‘petulant poet’ as your area of expertise? I am weird architecture. Anyway, where have you been? I’ve been looking for you, but you both just vanished.

ARCHIVIST
Ah. Right. I see.

HELEN
I was so looking forward to catching up after that whole Basira and Daisy thing, but then pfft! You both disappear. I’d be very keen to know how you managed that little trick.

MARTIN
Why, it caught us by surprise too. I mean, w-we actually ended –

ARCHIVIST
[Firmly] We found somewhere to take a rest. That’s all.

MARTIN
Oh, yeah. Ah. Yes.

HELEN
Fine. Be like that. I can appreciate the particular pleasure of a kept secret.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sure you can.

HELEN
Anyway, such a shame about Basira and Daisy. I was really rooting for them to make up.

[HELEN GIVES AN EXASPERATED SIGH]

Oh give over. I was obviously just prodding her, trying to make a point. She didn’t want to kill her.

ARCHIVIST
What we want doesn’t matter much these days.

HELEN
Oh nonsense. What we want is the only thing that matters these days. And Basira wanted to join Daisy.

ARCHIVIST
She made her choice.

HELEN
With your assistance.

ARCHIVIST
It was still her choice.

HELEN
[Sighing] What a waste.

ARCHIVIST
No.

It wasn’t.

MARTIN
Basira is…

She’s going to be okay.

HELEN
Oh, is she? Do you want me to tell you what she’s been up to while you were ‘resting’? Where she is right now?

ARCHIVIST
You don’t need to. I already know.

MARTIN
I don’t.

[FAINT STATIC AS THE ARCHIVIST SEES]
ARCHIVIST
She’s currently moving through “The Void.” Hungry shadows drifting in the dark. She’s been there a long time, now, struggling to find the path.

MARTIN
But she will.

ARCHIVIST
I think so.

HELEN
Yeah, she does always seem to manage, doesn’t she? It’s impressive, although a little bit… tempting at times.

MARTIN
Look, Helen, what do you even want? You keep turning up like a bad penny, and –

Honestly, it seems like it’s… it’s just to be a dick!

HELEN
Gasp! I am trying to be friends, Martin. Forever is a long time. And I occasionally like to have some company that isn’t screaming.

MARTIN
What do you even think friendship is?

HELEN
I dunno, do I? The only personhood I have is from someone I ate.

MARTIN
You always said you were Helen.

HELEN
I am. I also ate her. It’s very simple, as long as you don’t think about it.

MARTIN
Look. Listen, I’m getting really sick of all thi–

ARCHIVIST
Leave it, Martin. She’s just trying to get under your skin.

MARTIN
Yeah? Well, she’s really good at it!

HELEN
Aww. Thanks, sweetie. But to be honest, I’m mainly just here to see which path you choose.

MARTIN
What do you mean?

HELEN
Well, you know, I need to know how much of a welcome mat to roll out.

MARTIN
Hang on…

ARCHIVIST
Martin, I’d prefer we talk about this alone.

HELEN
Oh, I bet you would. You were probably just going to bypass it entirely, weren’t you? I can’t believe you would deny him the choice to see his own domain.

MARTIN
My… my wha– John, my what?

MARTIN
I have a domain?

Yes.

[FOOTSTEPS]
[STATIC RISES]
[THE SOUND OF SHIFTING, SLIDING, STONE UNDERSCORES THE STATEMENT]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
They scratch and scrape and scamper down the halls of icy granite, fingers that end in jagged nails probing, eager, desperate for the wide and stately passages of marble they are so convinced are just around the corner. This corner? No, the next one? Surely soon, it must be soon, yes, I have simply misplaced it for a moment.

They scrabble over smoothly shifting steps that grow and shrink to hidden whims, and argue about the angle with nobody. If they are feeling very confident, they may lean down and stretch a curious tongue beyond their chipped teeth and rotten gums, desperate to add another sense to their observances, more evidence to support their declaration of what the world must be. Their beards are long and matted with their prevaricating spittle, and their hair is kept loose, hanging over their faces to hide the looks of confusion and fear.

There is a way out of here. There must be a way out of here. There is a pattern to the movements, an unseen system to the shifting of the doors and the opening of the tunnels. It simply takes observation and thought and patience and, above all else, intelligence. And that is what these men have in abundance. Intellects sharpened to the keen edge as a chef might sharpen their knife. They have spent their lives in holy objectivity, cleaving one Gordian Knot after another in the arena of publication and debate. They must simply study and learn if they are to escape the labyrinth. They will be the first to escape.

The one who sits in the central chamber cannot remember his name. But he knows that people called him ‘doctor’. He made sure of that. To ignore it would have been the greatest disrespect and he will not be disrespected. Doctor…uh, something, has been waiting here for a long time, timing and observing the rotations of the passageways above him. He knows for a fact that this is the central chamber because he is the one sat here. For his observations to make any sense they must be made from the centre of this place, and this is where he is observing from, so it stands to reason that it is the centre. The only firm and solid place in a cacophony of undulating architecture; the only point from which it may be solved.

How long has he been watching now? Scratching his notes and formulae into his skin with a fragment of splintered obsidian. It does not matter, time means nothing in the pursuit of knowledge, and he has no concerns except the solution. And he has cracked it. His mouth breaks into a smile, lip splitting in the grin, spilling a drop or two of scarlet onto skin so pale as to now be near-translucent. He has seen the others pointlessly wandering the halls, of course. Simpering pretenders claiming to see patterns when they are only being led by the siren call of their pathetic little biases. Their ridiculous pet theories. Not like him. They’ll remember him forever, the first to escape the Monument. His name will be hallowed with the greats: Doctor…uh… Doctor…

It doesn’t matter. There will be time enough for names and gloating and awards once his achievement is secured. And now is the time to put it to the test, to prove once and for all that his peers are ignorant amateurs beside him, who can finally boast that he has found the key to the system in which they all struggle. He begins to walk, calmly, and with a measured certainty, to the east.

Figuring out which way was east was the first step, and the most simplistic one, for the central chamber in which he had positioned himself received a ray of light from above at regular intervals that could only be sunlight. And thus it was a simple matter to track the course of the light to determine which direction was east and which was west. Once he had noticed that, it was all about keeping a close eye on the timing of the shifts, cross-referenced with the compass-point. In a westward direction, the corridors would invert every forty-seven seconds and shift incline every twenty, as well as growing a door to a staircase every two minutes. The staircase would be always be descending except for every fifth door, which would go up and twist to the north. And just like that, he had plucked order from what would, to any of the other charlatans that wandered this prison of geometry, appear to be true chaos. It was east that he travelled now, however, because every eighty seconds, the second corridor to the east made a sharp upwards inversion, leading to a full minute where every seven seconds a door would sprout from the ground.

A dead end. Wait. No. This… wasn’t right. The first of the doors would lead him… Maybe that wasn’t the first of the doors. But it, it was, it was the first door. But that would mean… No, he, he was right, he was certain, he had factored in all the timings. This didn’t make sense. It, it wasn’t fair! He had the answer! He –

[SOUND OF BODY FALLING, HITTING STONE AND CRACKING]
The ground opens up below the poor, panicking doctor. He barely has time to register before he is tumbling, falling, smashing bone and cracking skull on the stairs and columns he impacts on his descent, one after another. But it is not the fall that terrifies him, not the pain of the impacts, but the fact that none of them should be there. That it doesn’t make sense. And it must make sense. There must be a system. There must be, because if there isn’t…

[THE BODY LANDS WETLY]
He lands with a heavy smack onto rough limestone and lies still, his body twisted and broken. He knows it will knit itself back together, slowly, painfully, as it always has before. But the thought of starting over, of composing yet another theory, fills him with a deep dread.

The broken doctor is not alone in the room where he now lies. Another figure, stooped and mumbling, staining bloody notes into a torn and discoloured robe glances over at him. A sneer passes across the cracked face of the doctor. He knows this man, a ‘professor’, at least he puffs himself up to be. His curled lip is reflected in the face of this pretender, who scampers over to where he fell, chunks of stone clutched tight in pink and bloody hands.

‘I told you,’ the professor gloats, ‘that your precious compass-point rubric is nonsense. It’s all about the stone, the rocks that make up this place. You see, here we have the limestone, here the granite. Taste it. No? Your loss. I have also identified basalt and slate in varying qualities shot through the staircases in veins. Now, if we ascribe a hierarchy of spiritual purity to these stones, with the hypothetical, but inevitable, marble at the top, then it is will be a simple matter of following the current of these stones through the–’

The doctor that lies on the floor has recovered just enough to laugh.

‘You’re still working on mineral theory? How painfully outdated.’

A flash of genuine fear crosses the face of the professor at this dismissal, before he picks up his chunk of granite, and begins to smash the doctor’s head in yet again.

MARTIN
Finished?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
Good.

…

I need you to explain something to me.

ARCHIVIST
Alright.

MARTIN
How do I have a domain? That doesn’t make any sense.

ARCHIVIST
It’s like I said. Everything here is either watcher or watched.

MARTIN
Subject or object, yes, I know, we’ve been over this.

ARCHIVIST
Well, you’re a watcher, Martin. You worked for the Institute, you read statements. The Eye is… fond of you. You’re not getting thrown into your own personal hell, which means…

MARTIN
[Quietly] That one of them belongs to me. But that’s… H-How can I be a ‘Watcher’? I didn’t even know it existed!

ARCHIVIST
But you’ve suspected for a while now, haven’t you?

MARTIN
Maybe. But that’s not ‘watching’!

ARCHIVIST
Do you want me to tell you about it?

MARTIN
No.

Yes.

N-No. No. I don’t know.

[SEEING STATIC RISES]
ARCHIVIST
It’s a small domain. A swirling mix of The Eye and The Lonely. Inhabited by a few lost souls whose fear is not of their isolation or their agonies, but that no-one will ever know of them. That they shall suffer in silence, and be mourned by nobody. That’s why you can’t really see it. It’s why even if we do travel through it, you won’t be able to see any of the people trapped there.

MARTIN
But I’m not an avatar.

ARCHIVIST
[Heated] Avatar isn’t a thing, Martin! It’s not–

It’s just a word. A word used by… fools like Smirke to try and sort everything into neat little boxes, to reduce the messy spray of human fear into a checklist: Human, avatar, monster, victim. Only now, now there’s a binary. There’s finally a clear dividing line and, well, I’m sorry you’re not happy with which side you’ve ended up on.

MARTIN
What about Daisy? Or Basira?

ARCHIVIST
Daisy carved through the domains of others. Basira, well… in a very real way, she was a sufferer in Daisy’s domain. Maybe the only one. Hunting, following, hurting. Now Daisy’s dead… she’s free. Sort of. She’s inherited something of Daisy’s ability to move through the other domains.

For now, she’ll feed off what she sees in them. As to whether the Eye ultimately gives her a domain of her own… I don’t know yet.

MARTIN
You didn’t tell her any of that.

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t think the metaphysics of her place in the fear ecosystem was something she’d be particularly interested in at that moment.

MARTIN
Fair. But you seem very reluctant to tell anyone any of this stuff.

ARCHIVIST
I did try, right at the start, but you didn’t seem to want to talk about it, so I didn’t push it. It’s hard, I have so much knowledge but… how do I decide what people want me to share, and what they never want to know?

MARTIN
I guess that makes sense.

…

So What did you mean about the crossroads? When you were talking to Helen?

ARCHIVIST
It’s a maze in there. Something between a, a Rubik’s Cube and a Magic Eye picture. I can find us the way through easily enough but, well, for us, there are two ways out. Two paths to London.

MARTIN
What are the choices?

ARCHIVIST
One would be a long, winding route. We’d see a lot of horrors, but remain personally untouched.

MARTIN
And the other is my domain?

ARCHIVIST
Eventually. It’s a shorter path. With faces we know along the way. Including Helen.

MARTIN
I thought Helen was her domain, with all the doors and that?

ARCHIVIST
She is, but she has a position within this… pseudo-landscape like any other.

MARTIN
O-Okay. So, so, I mean, I suppose we’ve got to do that one, right?

ARCHIVIST
We don’t have to. W-We could just –

MARTIN
What? What? We, we could dodge around it? Take the path of denial? I guess. But… what is it you keep harping on about? ‘The journey will be the journey’?

I mean… It’s pretty obvious this one is my journey.

[CONTINUOUS SOUNDS OF CRAWLING, SCUTTLING AMASSED ANTS]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
There are so many. They are beyond number. Though one could pluck a numeral from the air and add some zeros, place a figure on how many tiny, twitching things exist within these tunnels, it cannot be comprehended. Not truly. The human mind can barely understand the true extent of a billion, and there are so many more than a billion of them. A trillion. An octillion. A quindecillion.

Just words and zeros; no connection to the true scale of what they are, how much they represent. They are past the place where numbers have meaning. How many ants are there? Uncountable.

They shift and roil in dark and shining tides across the walls of the tunnels, pock-marked in their turn by tiny earthen holes from which the things emerge, retreat and move as one. All around it may seem like solid earth that presses down and forces Jordan through on hands and knees, but it is not. He tries again to find somewhere to place his hands, an inch or less of bare rock or undisturbed earth, but there is nothing. He does not know if this tunnel has the ants that bite, the ones that reek when they are crushed, or the ones so tough his weight does not destroy them, and he can still feel them moving and squirming beneath his palm.

Jordan knows there is no way out. No twisting, squeezing passage that promises escape, that will allow him to emerge, screaming and encrusted with filth and insect gore, to take a gasp of fresh and open air. But still he must push on, press forward, keep moving. For he knows that when he stops, when he pauses, when finally succumbs to exhaustion and collapses, that is when they descend upon him, subsume him beneath their impossible number. He can try to keep them out, to cover his ears, close his mouth, squeeze his nose shut, close his eyes. But not forever. Eventually he can’t hold back the scream, but it is muffled the moment his lips part to let it out.

So he keeps moving, scrabbling, pushing forward, clawing his way towards nothing but another few precious moments where he is not covered. For a moment he hesitates at a crossroads, two tunnels before him, one large enough he need only stoop, the other narrow. He’d need to squeeze. And for a moment Jordan’s sense of scale deserts him completely. Are these tunnels actually sized for him? Or has he himself been sized for this looping, intricate colony?

He shakes off such thoughts. The ants remain as small to him as ever, and as numerous. He chooses the tighter passage. Pressed so closely there can be fewer of them inside, and those that come for him will be quickly crushed. Or so he hopes. And as he presses himself through the jagged stone, it seems as if he has calculated correctly. The sharp scraping of rock is almost a relief after the tickling itch he has been enduring for so long, as they tear at his ragged clothes that never fully rip, and always leave crevices enough for ants to hide.

There are few ants in this tunnel, so few that Jordan can barely feel them on him. At least, until they begin to bite, and the shooting pains begin to rip through him. He jerks wildly, trying to reach his tormentors to brush them off or kill them, but the tunnel is too narrow and keeps his arms pinned to his sides. He flails, cutting his back against the ceiling, and freezes, the panicked thought gripping him, the image of those ants crawling down, into his wounds, into his skin, hollowing him out and making their colony tunnels of his veins. He screams, a wordless, haggard cry of despair.

Leto hears the scream, echoing down through chamber after chamber of his friends, but he does not understand it. He waits for it to end, looking for its source, but it just seems to go on and on and on. Eventually he does not hear it, though he cannot say for certain that it has stopped. He wants to investigate, to see what sort of creature could make such a sound, but there is no step he can take that does not make him a murderer. He cannot stand or sit or shift without a hundred of those dearest to him paying for it with their lives.

Once, so long ago now that it seems almost like a memory of a dream, he knew these creatures, and they had known him. They had covered him, swarmed and embraced him, and he had, for a short, glorious time, known what it was to be loved on an unimaginable scale. For each and every ant was a life, a mind no lesser than his own, guided by senses utterly alien yet as vital as any he possessed. If we are as ants to those things above us that torment and toy with us for their amusement, why should not ants be like us, each with a life as rich and intricate as any person?

Leto knows this to be true, as for that all too brief a time his senses were attuned to theirs, and he knew them, truly knew them. Unnumbered minds and existences, all connected together as one, and they had loved him. When he thinks of it, it prickles his eyes with regret at the loss, the endless rolling mass of love that he had all but begged to consume him.

But it is gone. His friends, the minds that he had once known so intimately, had left him. Now he sees them, moving and pulsing around him in a steady tide of tiny bodies, but he cannot reach them as once he had. He cannot make them understand, and he cannot apologise as his movements, as every gesture of his grotesque, lumbering body ends a dozen, a hundred existences. Even the tears that Leto sheds in grief will fall and drown his friends. He holds his arms in close and tries not to move.

[EARTH SHIFTS AND CRUMBLES]
[FOOTSTEPS]
There is someone else here now, someone shouting at him. The voice, it is the one who was screaming in the tunnels. He is still screaming, yelling something at Leto. Blood drips from all over him, matted into his hair, crusting his lips with red. He flails his arms wildly and stamps his feet, pulping a mass of ants, ending their lives with such a cruel and callous disregard that Leto is filled with a sudden rage. His limbs are willed with an energy they have not known in an age as he lunges at the awful murderer.

[MOVEMENTS ACROSS DIRT]
Jordan sees the crying man coming, face twisted in some bone-deep hatred as he lunges at him. The relief he had felt, the momentary elation of seeing another human face in this dreadful labyrinth evaporates in an instance, replaced by the sick familiarity and bitter déjà vu of a cycle repeating itself once again. He steps to the side, almost falling, feeling the bite of more ants as he pushes into a mass of them on the wall of the small chamber.

[SOUNDS OF PULP AND EARTH]
The man who charged him lets out a noise of terrible realisation as he overbalances and topples forward, his whole body slamming into the dark insectile carpet that covers the floor.

[BODY COLLAPSES AMIDST EARTH AND SHIFTING FORMS]
The impact is heavy, and then he lies still.

He can feel them below him. The dead and the dying, murdered by Leto’s clumsiness, his rash and destructive rage. The fear he felt as he was falling has been replaced by a sick dread of standing back up, of seeing the destruction his fall has wrought upon those that trusted him. The other man, that bloody omen of doom, is talking again, ranting, spewing nonsense about a queen, about finding her, about killing her. Leto struggles not to laugh; the words rattle around his mind in hollow recognition. There is no queen, he knows that. There is no single will to command the wondrous expanse of crawling lives. Each and every one is their own, and together they are so much more. He says as much to the interloper, preparing as he does so to stand, but before he can he feels the tell-tale tickle of his friends moving over him, covering him. He cannot rise, cannot lift himself without killing them. He begs them to save themselves, to let him up, but they will not understand his words.

Jordan leaves the man to his despair, the words rattling around in his head. No queen. He knows that, of course, but sometimes he allows himself the smallest flicker of hope that maybe there is a heart to this place, some core chamber where the bloated insectile monarch might sit, vulnerable and waiting.

But no, it is all the same, just the endless maze and ants and tunnels, unnumbered minds, meaningless in themselves, but together a being that dwarfs him, that if it wished to end his suffering could do so without a gesture. He turns the wrong corner, and the ants are upon him once again.

ARCHIVIST
Are you alright?

MARTIN
Y-Y-Yeah. I-I mean, no, I just…

ARCHIVIST
Don’t like ants?

MARTIN
Obviously not. No-one likes ants, John.

ARCHIVIST
As the embodiment of all knowledge, I am not entirely sure that’s true but… okay. What is it?

MARTIN
N-No, it’s just… you know the guy you were talking about? Jordan?

ARCHIVIST
The exterminator, yes.

MARTIN
I was having a look around and… I found him. A few tunnels over.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I know.

MARTIN
Sorry, yeah, of course you do. Oh, stupid.

ARCHIVIST
No, it’s alright. I’ve been trying to… I’m not sure what to do about it.

MARTIN
Well, who’s the avatar in charge here then? That Amherst guy?

ARCHIVIST
No, John Amherst was encased in concrete, and shrivelled away to nothing after just a few years. If they’d unearthed him before the change, maybe, but as it was he was so starved of fear…

MARTIN
So who, then?

ARCHIVIST
Well, I’m not sure if…

MARTIN
John, who is it?

ARCHIVIST
It’s the ants.

MARTIN
What? Ohhhh, like a, like a huge ant queen or something?

ARCHIVIST
No. All of them. As a collective. Crawling, devouring, spreading. One colony, one being, one avatar.

[FURTHER SOUNDS OF MARTIN’S LACK OF ENTHUSIASM]
MARTIN
Right. Great.

…

Nope. Nope. Do not like that one at all. No. Okay. So what happens if you destroy them, then? I-I mean, if they’re both the avatar and the domain?

ARCHIVIST
The whole place would collapse and then, without The Corruption’s influence, I think The Buried would flow in to fill the gap.

MARTIN
I thought you said Smirke’s Fourteen was a load of bull?

ARCHIVIST
I said it was limited, and draws artificial borders, but it does have its use when it comes to conceptualising these things. Regardless, I’m pretty sure we’d be left somewhat… entombed.

MARTIN
But we could get out, though?

ARCHIVIST
Eventually.

No. No, probably not a good idea.

[A PRISON ALARM SOUNDS, METAL DOORS SLAM]
[THROUGHOUT THE STATEMENT, A BED CREAKS AND THERE ARE FAINT INSTITUTIONAL SOUNDS]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
They have never told her what crime she has been arrested for. She isn’t even sure she was ever arrested. They had walked up to Tina in the street, as she was loading her car with shopping, and placed a hand on her shoulder gently but with the certainty of gravity. Her fingertips still remembered the chill of the milk as she placed it in the boot of the old Toyota. She had smiled when she turned, reassured by the sight of the uniforms, and didn’t even notice the sternness of their expression or the fact that the faces beneath the helmets were identical. All day she had been feeling on edge, smelling the faintest hint of something rotten on the wind. Had it been her imagination? No, others had sensed it too, she was sure of it. In the shops she had seen them, eyes darting nervously, fingers drumming incessantly on trolly handles, waiting for whatever was coming. And all day, that intense, unshakeable feeling that she was being watched.

So when she turned and saw them standing there, so official in their vests and helmets, what else was she to think? Ah, thank goodness, it flitted through her mind as Tina felt herself relax, whatever it is, someone is taking care of it. Because that’s what they were for, to take care of these problems, to shuffle people away for their own protection, and keep the world working as it should be. She smiled, even as the shadowed figure did not remove his hand from her shoulder.

“Hello, officer. How can I help?”

“I’m afraid you’re going to have to come with us,” they had said, as the sky above them began to change.

And then she was here. Tina didn’t remember the journey, not properly. There was an image of the back seat of a car, bruised face pressed against metal grating, wrists pinched so tight by metal she could feel every beat of her pulse. Or was it the back of a van, deep rumblings from the wheel well beneath her seat, vision obscured by a black bag that smelled of other people’s despair? Had she been forced to listen to a sanctimonious lecture on choices, on right and wrong and other luxuries? Or sharp-edged jokes at her expense in a language she didn’t quite understand, which turned to shouts and blows when she risked a movement. It didn’t matter, it wasn’t her memory. She was just here.

The room in which Tina found herself was barren: a metal bench encrusted with something black and flaky, and a bucket in the corner. That was it. It was obviously a mistake, some miscommunication somewhere, or a case of mistaken identity. These things were unfortunate, but sometimes they happened. One of the people in charge would no doubt realise and sort it all out. She smothered the kernel of dread that was lurking in her chest. She just needed to be patient.

The bench was uncomfortable to sit on, and she began to shiver from the cold. Had she ever been this cold before? Outside, of course, in the deepest winter, bundled up and pushing through to a heated home. But sat inside, with nowhere to go, nothing to change or wrap up in, just a thin grey jumpsuit, unable to do anything but sit there and shiver. That was a sort of cold that was alien to her.

[MORE CREAKS, THEN FOOTSTEPS]
She stood, trying to push down her physical discomfort and worry with movement. The cell was small and cramped, and Tina kept hitting her shin on the bench. She paused, casting an eye over the rough concrete wall surrounding her, covered in deep grooves and… scratch marks. She turned away quickly, and saw the window above her. Had there been a window when she had first come here? When had that been? It had no glass, just thick iron bars, but if she stood on tiptoe and really strained, she could just about see out of it.

[FAINT SOUNDS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD]
When she saw the world beyond her walls, her heart sank. The world seemed so bright and normal. The sun was high and shining, though none of it passed though the bars, and if she tried to reach through, the light seemed to shrink from her skin. Cars passed by on the road. Somewhere, a bird was singing. The world didn’t miss her, didn’t know or care about what was happening beyond these walls.

A child passed by, a girl with plaited blonde hair and a bright orange bicycle. Tina called quietly, suddenly afraid of who might be listening on the other side of her cell door. The child’s eyes met hers, the first moment of human connection that she had really felt since she’d arrived… but hadn’t she only just got here?… and Tina felt herself begin to smile. Then the child’s eyes narrowed in sudden hatred as the little girl bent down, picked up a rock and hurled it at the window. It passed cleanly through the bars and hit Tina square in the forehead. Her vision flashed white with pain as she fell back, slamming against the bench with a crunch.

[SOUND OF COLLAPSE AGAINST AN OBJECT]
Part of her wanted to lie there and weep, overcome with what was happening to her. But faster than that came the anger, the indignation. How dare they? She did not deserve this. She was better than this. This did not happen to people like her. She clawed her way back up to the window and looked out, trying to see the spiteful little brat, but the girl was now behind her father, who shooed her away with a terror in his eyes, a terror aimed at Tina. And for the briefest of moments she was certain that the man’s fear was mocking her.

Behind her she heard the sound of a key sliding into the filthy iron lock of her cell door. She tried to tell herself that sound was a good thing, that it meant someone was coming to check on her, to clear this all up, to tell her what was happening. But this was not the place for such lies.

[A DOOR CREAKS OPEN, KEYS JANGLE, THE DULL ROAR OF THE PRISON POPULATION IS LOUDER]
The door opened and there they stood, identical in their uniforms, their skin fish-belly white and their eyes gleaming with malice.

[HEAVY FOOTSTEPS, MORE KEYS, THE DOOR CLOSES AND SOUNDS ARE FAINTER ONCE AGAIN]
And then she was back in her cell. She didn’t remember the interview, not properly. Or had it been a trial? There had been a man, she was certain of it, and he had smiled as he sat across from her. And there had been a file, a thick manila envelope stained with grease and coffee, which held the pages of her life typed out in a small, no-nonsense font. She remembered that she had read those pages with increasing alarm. It had all been there, all of it. Her life, her loves, her choices, her mistakes. No details spared, no nasty inference ignored. There was no benefit of the doubt here, no understanding or kindness, only the disinterested ink of words that would see her prosecuted.

“None of these things are illegal,” she had said.

The man had laughed at that. It had been a dry and hacking sound that cracked the mirrored glass of the interview room, and made the juror’s ears bleed. He stroked his badge… or had it been that gnarled and bloodstained gavel?.

“The laws have changed.”

And now she is back in her cell. Or a cell that looks like hers. It is smaller, perhaps, the metal bench is cleaner, but rusted through on the hinges, so when she lies on it, it squeals and threatens to collapse. They never told her any charges, never gave her any verdict. She is certain she will see that man, the judge or the detective or the warden, she will see him again. Perhaps she will be moved, or written up, or reprimanded. The cold is settling in, the hunger is biting her as she tries to sleep. There has been a mistake. She should not be here, but she had met the person in charge, she had pleaded her case, told him of what had happened. And he had laughed at her.

[METALLIC RATTLING]
A tray slides under the door, spilling thin, watery stew over the floor, tipping out chunks of something that glistens and writhes. Tina ignores it as she grabs the hatch and tries to keep it open, tries to tell the guard, to explain what’s happened, that something’s gone wrong, that she shouldn’t be here. This isn’t right! Why can’t anybody see this? This isn’t the place for people like her.

[METALLIC SLAMMING]
The hatch slams shut on her fingers and she pulls her hand back, pain robbing her voice of protest for a moment. Outside the window night has fallen and the temperature starts dropping even further. Perhaps if she behaved they would give her a blanket? Perhaps she could see other people, share her story of injustice? Tina tells herself so many lies, as she shivers in the dark. The moonlight falls on those old and faded scratch marks on the concrete wall, and as she places her hand on the shallow grooves, they match her fingers perfectly. She refuses to count the tally marks that cover every inch.

[STATIC RISES AND FADES]
[METAL DOOR CREAKS OPEN]
MARTIN
All done?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
I still think doing it in one of the actual cells was a bit much.

ARCHIVIST
It was the most soundproof place I could find.

MARTIN
Pffft. Soundproof? Yeah, dream on.

ARCHIVIST
You… heard? I-I’m sorry. I know it was –

MARTIN
I actually didn’t, but only because I was too busy hearing what was going on in all the other cells.

ARCHIVIST
Ah. Well, they seem to have quieted for a while at least.

MARTIN
Yeah, one of those… things, passed by just now, and everyone shut right up.

ARCHIVIST
Mmm. Jailors have that effect.

Shall we go?

MARTIN
What if another one comes along?

ARCHIVIST
It’s fine. We’re, uh, we’re ‘guests of the Warden’.

MARTIN
Eurgh.

ARCHIVIST
Mmhmm. Come on.

[FOOTSTEPS AND METAL CREAKS]
MARTIN
Does it not bother you?

ARCHIVIST
What? Being a ‘guest’?

MARTIN
Yeah. It’s not like it resisted. Hell, it was chummy.

ARCHIVIST
Would you rather it had attacked?

MARTIN
No it’s just… Is that how these creatures see us now? As one of them?

ARCHIVIST
[Amused] I forgot that’s a new experience for you.

MARTIN
Excuse me?

ARCHIVIST
You have to remember I’ve had this for years. Right from the start, it’s always been ‘Archivist’ this and ‘Archivist’ that. All these weird, awful creatures assuming I’m ‘in’ on all the secrets. Even when they were trying to kill me, they treated me like I was a… a peer.

MARTIN
Yeah, but they were still trying to kill you.

ARCHIVIST
Not all of them. And now? Sure the power’s shifted, it’s all politeness and respect, but it still feels just like more of the same. I guess I just stopped caring at some point. Besides they are technically right, I am one of them. To a degree.

MARTIN
I suppose.

ARCHIVIST
I think the real question is how are you finding it?

MARTIN
It’s not the same. I’m still just your ‘plus one’.

ARCHIVIST
[Amusedly] Don’t put yourself down. It’s not your fault you’re a bit overshadowed. I am such a very big deal after all.

MARTIN
Oh, very big arse, more like it.

[THE ARCHIVIST CHUCKLES]
ARCHIVIST
Either way, even if I wasn’t here, I don’t think you’d be in any danger. Not anymore. I wasn’t sure when we first started out, I hadn’t properly, er… looked into it, as it were. But now I’m certain.

MARTIN
I’m one of them.

ARCHIVIST
One of… us.

MARTIN
That’s not as comforting as you think it is.

ARCHIVIST
Doesn’t mean it’s not true though.

[PRISON & PRISONER SOUNDS ARE CLEARER HERE]
MARTIN
And this is all because I’ve been given a domain? Because apparently I somehow have people’s fear feeding me?

ARCHIVIST
Well, feeding The Eye through you, but yes.

MARTIN
Even though I didn’t ask for it? Did nothing to deserve it?

ARCHIVIST
‘Deserve’. Huh. Now there’s a word that always causes trouble.

MARTIN
Don’t be patronising.

ARCHIVIST
I just mean that nobody here deserves the position they’ve found themselves in, not really. I suppose a few may have asked for it, sought it out even, but far more didn’t. They just made the wrong choices for the right reasons. Or even the right choices. But ones that still led them here in the end.

MARTIN
I hate it.

ARCHIVIST
On balance, that’s probably a good thing.

[SUDDEN RATTLING AGAINST METAL BARS]
INSPECTOR
Hey! Hey, you! Yeah, I know you!

MARTIN
Uh…

INSPECTOR
It’s… f-f-from the, uh, Magnus Institute! Um… ah… Mark!

ARCHIVIST
You know him?

MARTIN
Martin.

INSPECTOR
Martin, right, yeah! You remember? You tipped us off, and we came and nicked your boss, that Bouchard bloke.

MARTIN
Oh! Oh, right! The, um… oh, Inspector… I-I’m so sorry, I’ve forgotten your name.

INSPECTOR
So have I. I’m just 547 in here.

MARTIN
God, I’m so sorry.

INSPECTOR
You’ve gotta help me!

MARTIN
Oh. I – er… I don’t –

INSPECTOR
I heard you! You said you were chummy with the Warden. And I need to get out, I-I can’t – This place – You’ve got to help me!

ARCHIVIST
Martin? What do you think?

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
I decided about Jordan. This place is from your past.

MARTIN
Yeah, but I mean, only briefly.

ARCHIVIST
Still.

INSPECTOR
Please! Martin! Come on mate, just returning a favour, yeah?

[MARTIN EXHALES]
W-Wh-What’s wrong? You-You’ve got to hurry! Th-There’s not much time.

[PACING]
MARTIN
Why are you here?

INSPECTOR
What?

MARTIN
What are you so afraid of, that you ended up in here?

INSPECTOR
I didn’t do anything!

MARTIN
John?

[COMPELLING STATIC RISES]
ARCHIVIST
Why are you here?

INSPECTOR
[Resisting] I don’t… Argh! Stop! Stop!

ARCHIVIST
I will stop when you answer the question.

INSPECTOR
Argh! Look, you can’t know if they’re all guilty, alright? It’s just about evidence…

[MARTIN SIGHS]
MARTIN
[Flatly] Right.

INSPECTOR
Sometimes you just have to… to…

MARTIN
What, guess?

INSPECTOR
I’m sorry! Alright?

MARTIN
No. You’re just afraid.

INSPECTOR
Please, I’m – It’s almost lights out. I can’t be here for lights out. Not again. Please? You owe me!

ARCHIVIST
This place is born of their nightmares. And of yours.

MARTIN
If you made him a watcher, he’d become part of this place?

ARCHIVIST
He would.

MARTIN
And if he was… Would he enjoy it?

INSPECTOR
What are you talking about? No! Of course not!

ARCHIVIST
You know I can’t see the future.

MARTIN
But?

ARCHIVIST
But I can see his past.

MARTIN
And based on that?

ARCHIVIST
He probably would. Yes.

INSPECTOR
Hey, fuck you, you scrawny little tit! What the hell do you know?

MARTIN
…

Leave him.

INSPECTOR
What? No, no, please! I didn’t mean it!

ARCHIVIST
Okay.

[FOOTSTEPS AS THEY WALK AWAY]
INSPECTOR
[Fading] I need your help! Please! Please! D-Don’t go away! Come back – look, we can talk – we can – Please! Mark! Martin! Martin! I can’t stay here! Don’t leave me here!

[WALKING CONTINUES, AS MARTIN EXHALES]
MARTIN
That was horrible.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry I put you in that position.

MARTIN
No, you were right to. That’s… that’s a lot of power to have to deal with. Lot of responsibility.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, thank you, Uncle Ben.

MARTIN
[Chuckle] Pop culture? Really?

ARCHIVIST
I’m allowed to know what Spiderman is.

[ANOTHER SIGH]
MARTIN
Not helping people is still a decision, isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Well, you saw Jordan, I’m not sure ‘helping’ is –

MARTIN
I know, I know, not the right word. Ignoring them then.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

It’s a choice I’ve been making a lot recently.

MARTIN
I guess we should get used to it. Knowing that all these awful things are happening for our benefit.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe it’s better if it never gets comfortable.

MARTIN
Maybe.

[THEY WALK IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE]
MARTIN
Hey, do you feel that?

ARCHIVIST
[Fading] Martin? Martin, listen you need to get ready, we’re about to enter –

[HARSH CRACKLE OF STATIC]
MARTIN
Yeah, my domain. Yes, right, I get it. Dream logic. And timing apparently.

…

John? John?

Oh…

Shit.

[CLICK]

[FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL OR DIRT, AS A LIGHT RAIN FALLS]
MARTIN
So this is it, then.

…

How dreary.

[FOOTSTEPS]
[Calling] Hello!? Anybody!?

John?

Hello!

…

Big surprise.

Well at least I can still remember everything this time. And no more bloody chairs.

It’s weird, though. Never actually been anywhere like this. That said, it is kind of… huh…

[STATIC RISES]
[THERE IS A SLIGHT REVERB ON ALSO MARTIN’S FIRST WORDS AS HE APPROACHES]
ALSO MARTIN
Wuthering Heights.

MARTIN
Yeah. God, I hated studying that. It was all just so…

ALSO MARTIN
Overblown.

MARTIN
Yeah…

ALSO MARTIN
But that cover… those wide empty spaces. It felt right, didn’t it?

MARTIN
So what? That’s where we are?

ALSO MARTIN
Right down to the monochrome.

MARTIN
Hm.

D’you have an umbrella?

ALSO MARTIN
No.

But you don’t want one. We like the rain.

MARTIN
True.

ALSO MARTIN
Because it makes the sadness feel at home. It turns it from a burden into –

MARTIN
[Sigh] – an indulgence

ALSO MARTIN
That’s right.

[PACING]
MARTIN
So what is this? You’re part of me so you know everything about me? Is that it?

ALSO MARTIN
Yes.

MARTIN
Because you’re part of my domain?

ALSO MARTIN
Also yes.

MARTIN
Some sort of cosmic joke about ‘being alone with my thoughts’, I assume?

ALSO MARTIN
I’m here because you’re trying very hard not to be alone. To resist the comfort.

MARTIN
So, instead I get to talk to myself?

ALSO MARTIN
Apparently.

[PACING CONTINUES THEN STOPS]
MARTIN
Okay, so if I’m so desperate not to be alone, why isn’t John here? Hmm? He can find me anywhere.

ALSO MARTIN
I don’t know.

MARTIN
[Dubious] Oh yeah?

ALSO MARTIN
Look, I know what you know. Maybe I’m just a bit more… open about it.

MARTIN
And what do you mean by that?

ALSO MARTIN
Like how you don’t actually want him here? Maybe that has something to do with it?

MARTIN
You’ve no idea what you’re talking about!

ALSO MARTIN
I mean, you can argue with me if you like. Seems like a bit of a waste, though.

MARTIN
I – No, a –

ALSO MARTIN
It’s alright. It’s hard to be vulnerable.

MARTIN
[Resigned] It’s not that.

ALSO MARTIN
No?

MARTIN
No, I just… I’m ashamed to let him see this place, alright. To see what – I don’t know, what feeds me?

ALSO MARTIN
Sure, that’s part of it, but… it’s not the whole thing, is it? Not really.

MARTIN
What do you mean?

ALSO MARTIN
Well, if you don’t count ‘memory manor’, when was the last time you were even on your own?

MARTIN
Well I… hmm.

ALSO MARTIN
It has been a very long time since the Institute.

MARTIN
That’s… a good point.

ALSO MARTIN
It’s okay to want a bit of space now and then. New romance is hard. And armageddon makes it even harder, never mind the fact that you’re metaphorically joined at the hip thanks to the whole ‘eye-lord’ thing. It’s okay to want some space.

MARTIN
Ohhhhh, I see.

ALSO MARTIN
See what?

MARTIN
I get it. So that’s your deal. You tell me what I want to hear to try and get me to stay.

ALSO MARTIN
[Wearily] Seriously? Fine. If you don’t want to engage, if you want to pretend I’m just some… temptation ghost, you go ahead. Knock yourself out. Like I said, I’m not your enemy.

MARTIN
[Archly] Oh really? I thought you said you were me?

ALSO MARTIN
Right, yes. Very clever.

MARTIN
We have our moments, I guess.

ALSO MARTIN
Look, if you want to leave, you can. It’s not a problem.

MARTIN
You won’t try to stop me?

ALSO MARTIN
I mean, it really doesn’t matter to me. You leave and I’m just you again. It’s all the same to me, really.

MARTIN
So why do you want me to stay then? Hmm?

ALSO MARTIN
Because you want to stay. Because you want to have a real rest. To just breathe and … be quietly sad, I guess.

[SILENCE AS THE RAIN GETS A LITTLE HEAVIER]
MARTIN
It’s not healthy.

ALSO MARTIN
Maybe not, but I’m not entirely sure what healthy options are even left, at this point.

MARTIN
We could talk to John about it.

ALSO MARTIN
We could. But we both know that loved ones make the worst therapists. They’re too wrapped up in trying to stop you hurting to actually help. But hey, we know all about that, am I right?

MARTIN
There’s nothing wrong with comforting people.

ALSO MARTIN
A cup of tea isn’t a resolution. At best it’s a… a plaster. At worst… a muzzle.

MARTIN
Yeah, yeah.

Even so, I could murder a cuppa. I doubt you’ve got a kettle out here though.

ALSO MARTIN
As a matter of fact, I do have a thermos.

MARTIN
You’re joking?

ALSO MARTIN
This is our domain. You’re not supposed to suffer here. Well, not like the others… you know what I mean.

[A METAL FLASK IS UNSCREWED]
[ELONGATED SOUND OF TEA POURING]
Here.

[FLASK IS RESEALED]
[MARTIN SIGHS DEEPLY AS HE SIPS]
MARTIN
Wait that’s… wait, is that…?

ALSO MARTIN
Yeah, sorry about that. There’s only so much we can do, what with the new world and everything. Even the good things get tinged with memory.

MARTIN
Eurgh. Oolong. Of course. Of course! Whenever I asked a question she didn’t like, or she wanted to stop the conversation –

ALSO MARTIN
Off you’d go to put the kettle on.

MARTIN
And it always had to be that bloody oolong. Eurgh.

[ANOTHER SIP]
Blergh.

ALSO MARTIN
…

It wasn’t your fault.

MARTIN
Yes, it was.

ALSO MARTIN
That’s just the guilt talking.

MARTIN
Oh, you think?

ALSO MARTIN
She was awful.

MARTIN
She wasn’t well.

ALSO MARTIN
Both things can be true.

MARTIN
She was still my mum! Our mum. Whatever!

ALSO MARTIN
[Emphatically] And we’re glad she’s dead.

MARTIN
Jesus…

ALSO MARTIN
Too much? Like I said, I’m a bit more open.

MARTIN
I –

ALSO MARTIN
Don’t lie. You don’t need to. Not here. It’s just us.

[HEAVY SIGH FROM MARTIN]
MARTIN
If we’re glad, why do I feel so…

ALSO MARTIN
Guilty?

Because you feel guilty about everything.

MARTIN
That’s… That’s not –

ALSO MARTIN
Your mother.

MARTIN
Stress is a proper factor in a stroke –

ALSO MARTIN
Everything that’s happened to John.

MARTIN
I brought Jane Prentiss to the Institute!

ALSO MARTIN
The end of the entire world?

MARTIN
If I’d done what Peter had asked… If I’d not chickened out, and just killed Elias when I had the chance…

ALSO MARTIN
Really? Really? That’s how you’re choosing to remember it? Chickening out?

MARTIN
I remember it was the wrong choice.

ALSO MARTIN
You choose to remember it that way, and so the guilt –

MARTIN
I get it, alright? But I need it. I-I choose the guilt, because…

ALSO MARTIN
[Leading] Because…

MARTIN
Because it motivates me to do better!

ALSO MARTIN
…

Does it though? Or… does it just keep paralysing us, make us shrink back and wait, hoping things work out? Like with John, when we thought the worms had got him.

MARTIN
Hey, to be fair, he still kind of hated me back then. I’m really not sure it would have been the time to take my shot.

ALSO MARTIN
Fair. He was projecting hard. Between us, that guy’s got some real issues.

MARTIN
Hey! Pretty sure we love ‘that guy’.

ALSO MARTIN
Yeah, and all his many, many problems.

MARTIN
Fine.

ALSO MARTIN
But also, you know that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s this, this fantasy that you have, that whatever you find at the top of the Panopticon is just going to solve everything.

MARTIN
I don’t –

ALSO MARTIN
You do though. You daydream about it! The big climactic showdown with Elias, and then the two of you kiss, and push a button that just magically saves the world and makes everything better.

MARTIN
It’s actually not a button, so –

ALSO MARTIN
Stop. Deflecting.

MARTIN
[Angry] S-So what, okay? We should just give up? Hmm? Just stay here and curl up into a ball and just accept the world as is? Hmm? That’s your big solution?

ALSO MARTIN
I’m saying there aren’t any easy solutions. We have no idea what’s going to happen. Even if we make it to the tower, we don’t know there’ll be a fix. And if by some miracle there is, we both know the price will be awful. Just look at Melanie.

MARTIN
I –

[A RESIGNED SIGH]
ALSO MARTIN
We are completely out of our depth. We’re responsible for everyone everywhere, and we have no idea what we’re doing. The last thing we need is self-indulgent guilt on top of that.

MARTIN
I can be a real manipulative prick, you know that?

ALSO MARTIN
Oh, yeah.

[PAUSE FOR REFLECTION]
[MARTIN FINISHES HIS CUPPA]
MARTIN
[Grimly] Tea.

Please.

[FLASK IS UNSCREWED AGAIN]
[TEA SOUNDS ENSUE]
So, this price. What do you think?

Are we going to have to kill John?

ALSO MARTIN
I don’t know because you don’t know. But it seems like something we should at least consider.

MARTIN
I… have thought about it. And… I won’t. I don’t think I could.

ALSO MARTIN
Mmhmm.

MARTIN
But anything else? Any other price? I’ll pay it.

ALSO MARTIN
Even dying?

MARTIN
Yeah!

ALSO MARTIN
John’s as bad as we are. He wouldn’t let it happen.

MARTIN
It’s not his decision.

ALSO MARTIN
Fine. So flip that round, then. What are you going to do when he tries to sacrifice himself, because you know he’s going to try?

MARTIN
I don’t know, all right? I don’t know.

ALSO MARTIN
And that’s okay for now, but I just want us to have thought about this stuff properly before it comes up. Because even if that’s not it, chances are it’ll be something else you don’t want to do, and we need to make a proper choice. We can’t just react out of shame or fear or whatever.

MARTIN
What, like with Peter and Elias?

ALSO MARTIN
Yes.

MARTIN
That was a proper choice?! I chose wrong!

ALSO MARTIN
But you made a decision. Your own decision. Regardless of the outcome.

MARTIN
I… I’ll think about it.

ALSO MARTIN
We’ll think about it.

MARTIN
Sure.

[ANOTHER SIGH, ANOTHER SIP]
What about the people here?

ALSO MARTIN
What people?

MARTIN
I don’t know. My… ‘prisoners’, I guess?

ALSO MARTIN
What about them?

MARTIN
Why haven’t we talked about them?

ALSO MARTIN
Because you didn’t want to think about them. So, we didn’t.

MARTIN
Yeah? Well, I want to now. Consider it a ‘proper choice’ if you like.

ALSO MARTIN
Okay.

MARTIN
Can I see them?

ALSO MARTIN
No. This place is about hidden, unnoticed suffering.

MARTIN
I can feel them, though.

ALSO MARTIN
Sure, you’re aware of it, dimly. A sort of far-off, lonely terror. But there’s no way for us to actually see or hear them.

MARTIN
Hmm. But… if this is my domain, can I fix that? Like, can I change things?

ALSO MARTIN
If you wanted to start actively tormenting them, I’m sure this place would oblige. But ‘fixing’ things? Making it easier on them, or freeing them… probably not.

MARTIN
Fine.

…

Can you tell me about them?

ALSO MARTIN
I can. Deep down, we do know what’s happening to them.

MARTIN
Do we know who they are?

ALSO MARTIN
We never met them in the old world. Although one of them is named Tim. Just a coincidence, I think, unless it was a subconscious thing on our part.

MARTIN
Tell me. Please. Like John would.

ALSO MARTIN
Why? Just so you can torture yourself?

MARTIN
I want to know the exact limits of my guilt.

ALSO MARTIN
Fair enough.

ALSO MARTIN (STATEMENT)
I can’t tell you their names, because we don’t know them. Who they are, who they were – these details are lost to us. But they’re also lost to them. Sometimes they get flashes, moments of people they might have been. Phantom pasts, the ghosts of happy futures. But they’re empty, and vanish if they try to hold them.

One of them is young, though he has always felt old. He has always felt tired. He has stood apart from everyone who ever cared for him and never felt the distance. His family were cold, and so to keep that coldness at bay, he built a towering wall between them and him. He hid it in jokes and practiced smiles, but on a cloudy day, they could see it. And when he was able to leave his family behind, that wall came with him, following him, keeping out the world.

He would walk the streets of the city at night and wish the world away, so it could be just him, with no-one to know him or judge him or hurt him. Sometimes, when the emptiness inside began to bite, he reached out for people, and took a friend or a lover. But when he did, it was only to watch them beat themselves again and again against that wall, until they finally relented, and he was alone once more. He told himself it was for the best. He told himself he liked it like that.

And now he is here. The wall still surrounds him, though now it encircles all the fields where he staggers, wet from the rain, and cold from the wind. He calls out for somebody to see him, for somebody to know how achingly hollow he is. He walks and walks and walks, desperate for another voice, for someone to know where he is and what he’s going through. But he can’t shout too loud. If he does, he feels the thick grey mulch rising from where it has settled in the hollow of his chest. It pushes up his throat and streams from his mouth instead of words. It is clouded and so bitterly cold that where it lands, the scrubland grass turns brittle and crumbles away, leaving only ice, pulled from the deepest parts of him, hardened and crusted into a smooth, dark mirror, reflecting his lined and careworn face against the clouded sky. The rain pricks his skin, though there is no comfort in it. Because he knows he can never be warm and dry again. The wall is too high.

But still he keeps walking, keeps crying out, though quieter now. Nobody knows he’s here, and if they did, they wouldn’t care. He has driven them all away, kept them so far from who he is that there is no-one now to see his suffering. No-one who cares.

He falls to his knees, icy mud clinging to his legs, soaking through his threadbare trousers as tears and rain fall from his cheeks in equal measure. Next to him, a woman lies on her side, curled tight around herself, head tucked to her chest. He does not see her, cannot hear her wracking sobs, so close to his. She could reach out her hand, touch his arm, his face, his heart… and would feel nothing. Neither would ever know. Because at their core they are alone, and nothing can release them from that absolute knowledge.

She stands, legs shaking from the cold and from the effort, her muscles locked in place, and joints protesting at the shift. How long has she been lying there? How long have the fingers of despair locked around her throat? She doesn’t know, and she feels in her bones that no one else does, either. Nobody knows she’s here, and she misses them all.

She tries to picture her friends. A warm and smiling procession of faces, a technicolour memory that only makes the iron grey sky that much duller, the misty drizzle that much colder on her face. What is she recalling? There was music once, lights, laughter. A birthday, maybe, or a pub lunch? They sat around, on old chairs, comfortable chairs in the warm. The taste of wine was on her tongue, and her mouth was curled into a smile. The carefree chatter of her friends surrounded her and soothed her. Or did it?

She wasn’t talking, wasn’t engaged with any of the bright and happy people. Her smile was fixed and deliberate, and it didn’t quite match her eyes. She was among this joy, yes, these sparkling friends, but she was not a part of it, not really. She tried to be, wanted so desperately to be a part of their easy warmth, and maybe they thought she was. But they hadn’t known her, not really. They hadn’t seen the empty ice that filled her, that kept her apart from them, that she desperately tried to thaw with each and every friendly face that smiled at her.

The memory fades, and she shivers as her mind returns to the rain and the wind, tinged with the sting of salt, and the slight stench of rotten seaweed, though there was no ocean here. She feels the ice within her still, and knows she never found anyone to melt it. And now? She never will. Those who tried, she gripped so tightly that they couldn’t breathe, and so she lost them anyway. Now nobody remembers her name. If they should stumble upon an old photograph, some half-remembered birthday party that still brings up a smile, and then see her face, sat there amongst the revellers, they will frown, just for a moment, as they try to remember her name. Then they will shrug, and forget they were even curious. They will not think to wonder about her.

And it is this that she is so deeply afraid of. Not the ache of her flesh from the bitter cold, not the cloying dampness of the rain, or the crushing fatigue from uncounted days or weeks or years without sleep. It is the sure knowledge that nobody remembers her existence enough to even wonder idly where she might be, or to ponder at her suffering.

She screams her fear to the open air, but none beside her hear it.

MARTIN
Thank you.

ALSO MARTIN
I’m sorry. I know it’s hard.

MARTIN
Yeah.

ALSO MARTIN
So? What are we thinking?

MARTIN
I’m thinking that I didn’t ask for this. It’s not my fault they’re here.

ALSO MARTIN
True.

MARTIN
But I can’t keep existing like this at their expense. It’s not… it’s not right. Whatever happens with Elias, W-with the rest of the world… I can’t live on the misery of others.

ALSO MARTIN
They’ll suffer either way.

MARTIN
I get it, okay? I can’t decide what happens to them. But… I just might be able to decide what happens to me. And… And if it comes down to it…

I’ll get John to destroy me like the others.

ALSO MARTIN
You don’t really believe he’d do it?

MARTIN
I don’t know. Maybe?

ALSO MARTIN
…

This took a dark turn.

MARTIN
Yeah. But… this time, it doesn’t feel like despair.

It feels like resolve.

ALSO MARTIN
Well, hopefully it won’t come to that.

MARTIN
Hopefully.

[MARTIN SIPS REFLECTIVELY]
Thanks for the tea.

ALSO MARTIN
We’re welcome.

MARTIN
Ha.

[FLASK IS RESEALED WITH THE LID]
So, how do I leave?

ALSO MARTIN
I think we just keep walking.

MARTIN
And John?

[BAG IS ZIPPED UP]
ALSO MARTIN
I kind of expected him to have interrupted already.

MARTIN
I’m sure he’ll find us eventually.

So are you going to knock or what?

ARCHIVIST
Perhaps I was just enjoying a quiet moment before you arrived.

HELEN
Yeah… Bit rude to do it on my doorstep, though, isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Perhaps. My apologies.

HELEN
So, where’s the old ball and chain? Surely you’re not paying me a visit on your lonesome?

ARCHIVIST
I am.

[DEEP INTAKE OF BREATH]
You gambled right.

HELEN
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.

ARCHIVIST
You hoped that by nudging us past his domain, Martin would still be there when I arrived… so I would have to pass through on my own. Apparently, you were right.

HELEN
I thought you said you weren’t going to look inside people’s heads?

ARCHIVIST
I thought you said you weren’t people.

Touché.

Well, for what it’s worth, I have tried not to look inside you.

HELEN
Oh yes?

ARCHIVIST
I maybe glimpse a motive, sometimes, but I try not to stare.

HELEN
I’m touched. Any particular reason for this monumental restraint?

ARCHIVIST
The same reason you don’t want Martin here. I wasn’t sure I wanted to kill you, and… you don’t want to die.

HELEN
…

He’s still so new to all of this, caught up in ideas of justice and ‘solving’ things. Sure, he can wave away the theoretical idea of people suffering…

ARCHIVIST
But if he sees it up close, he might try to get his boyfriend to smite you?

HELEN
Something like that. We’ve built up such a rapport, he and I. I’d hate to strain it over such a temporary disagreement. I’m just concerned for his happiness, you understand.

ARCHIVIST
Completely.

HELEN
I am a little bit surprised you didn’t follow him?

ARCHIVIST
He didn’t want me to.

I didn’t need special powers to know that. When he crossed the threshold I had to make a choice, and –

HELEN
– and you chose me.

ARCHIVIST
Let’s say you were something of a branching path.

HELEN
Hm. Always the flatterer.

So, when is he coming out the other side?

ARCHIVIST
It might take a while.

HELEN
Mmm, yeah, these quiet reflective domains sometimes do. Ah well, more time for us to hang out, I suppose. Shoot the breeze, share some hot goss…

ARCHIVIST
Excuse me while I try to contain my joy.

HELEN
You are excused. So…

[A DOOR CREAKS OPEN]
…are you coming?

ARCHIVIST
I thought we agreed I’m far too all-powerful to cross your threshold?

HELEN
Don’t flatter yourself. This isn’t some extension, some limb reaching out to snatch the wayward or the trusting. This domain, this magnificent building, is me.

[HELEN STRETCHES AND SIGHS CONTENTEDLY AS THE BUILDING DOES LIKEWISE]
You’re welcome here. We’ll be quite safe with you travelling through me. As long as neither of us does anything silly.

[STATIC CRACKLE FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
Or you could just stand there glowering. That’s fine too.

ARCHIVIST
I’m trying to ‘know’ if there’s another route I can take.

HELEN
And?

ARCHIVIST
Turns out there is, actually. But it is rather full of spiders.

[STATIC FADES AND FOOTSTEPS START WALKING AWAY]
HELEN
Oh, don’t be such a sourpuss.

[FOOTSTEPS STOP, FOLLOWED BY A SIGH]
It’ll be fun. I promise.

[AN EVEN HEAVIER SIGH FOLLOWS]
ARCHIVIST
Alright.

[FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL UNTIL THE ARCHIVIST CROSSES HELEN’S THRESHOLD, AND THE DOOR CREAKS SHUT EERILY]
[THE PIANO MUZAK CONTINUES AS HE ENTERS A HOTEL CORRIDOR. HELEN’S VOICE COMES FROM ALL AROUND]
HELEN
Oooh! [Shudders] It feels different… to last time.

ARCHIVIST
Different how?

HELEN
The tape recorder feels more, um… awake.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Oh, joy. Come on.

[STATIC RISES AGAIN AS HIS FOOTSTEPS START]
[HELEN REACTS AS IF HAVING EATEN SOMEONE FOUL]
HELEN
Ooh… Eeeeeeurgh!

ARCHIVIST
What?

HELEN
Eurgh. You just – blergh… You just knew the way through, well, me. And, eurgh, it’s not a pleasant feeling. No. I do not like that. Not at all.

ARCHIVIST
Well, tough. I’m not going to trust you to be my guide.

HELEN
[Exasperated] Would it kill you?

ARCHIVIST
It’s killed plenty of others.

[THE ARCHIVIST CONTINUES WALKING AS HOTEL SOUNDS ECHO AROUND]
[THE BUILDING CREAKS AS HELEN’S VOICE CHANGES RESONANCE AGAIN]
HELEN
You really don’t like me, do you?

ARCHIVIST
No.

HELEN
And you never have.

ARCHIVIST
Not really.

HELEN
Even though I saved you from Michael.

ARCHIVIST
You were Michael.

HELEN
Argh. I’m The Distortion, as was Michael, but I am not him, and never have been. Surely you know all this by now, what with your shiny new eye powers?

ARCHIVIST
It’s not about what I know. It’s about what I feel.

HELEN
[Disparagingly] Oh, what do you feel?

ARCHIVIST
I liked Helen.

HELEN
I am Helen.

ARCHIVIST
The real one.

HELEN
…

Helen-Classic.

ARCHIVIST
Sure.

HELEN
But that doesn’t make any sense. You barely met her. You had half an hour together, and she spent most of that ranting about mazes! She was positively delirious with paranoia!

ARCHIVIST
True. But as you’ll recall, I was pretty paranoid myself at that point.

HELEN
So what? You saw yourself in her? A sad reflection? A possible future?

ARCHIVIST
Maybe.

HELEN
Oh, John! This existence can be wonderful, if you just let it.

ARCHIVIST
[Sadly] I know.

[HE CONTINUES TO WALK]
HELEN
For what it’s worth, I really don’t think you would have liked her. If you’d known her better, I mean.

ARCHIVIST
No?

HELEN
You haven’t looked into Helen-Classic’s past yet? You should try it. I don’t think you’ll like what you find.

ARCHIVIST
What? Lying to real estate clients? Bit of a prick at parties? Secret Tory?

HELEN
Yes.

To all of them, actually.

ARCHIVIST
And that’s the problem. I could have grown to dislike her, but… you made sure that sort of thing could never happen. Now you use her form, see her mind, but they’re just… tools. Michael had nothing you could use but a razor-straight desire for vengeance, but you saw something in Helen that would work on me much more subtly. So you took her. And I’ll never get to dislike her.

I’m stuck disliking you instead.

HELEN
At least I care enough to bother.

ARCHIVIST
That’s true, I suppose.

[THE KNOWING STATIC RISES AGAIN]
HELEN
Oh. Blergh. Please stop doing that.

ARCHIVIST
I’ll stop doing it when I’m confident you’re taking me the right way.

HELEN
I am!

[STATIC FADES]
ARCHIVIST
The quickest way.

HELEN
Eurgh. Fine.

[THE CORRIDOORS SHIFT IN CRUNCHING WOOD AND BRICK]
[A DOOR CREAKS OPEN]
ARCHIVIST
So tell me. Why are we going the long way? You just trying to keep me from meeting any victims? Or are you trying to figure out if there’s still a way you can destroy me?

HELEN
…

A bit of both, to be honest.

ARCHIVIST
I see. How long have you been working with Elias?

HELEN
I’m not.

ARCHIVIST
[Faux-shocked] Helen! Is that… a lie?

HELEN
No! No, it’s not. I don’t know him. I’ve never even – Look, I’m happy here, all right? This world is fabulous, and I don’t want you to end it all because you’ve got a chip on your shoulder.

ARCHIVIST
So you think I can turn the world back?

HELEN
I think you’re bloody minded and stubborn, and I won’t underestimate you.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

HELEN
And for all his bleeding heart, Martin’s just as bad. Worse, even, in some ways.

ARCHIVIST
[Fondly] Yes, he is.

HELEN
You are so difficult to like sometimes. I’ve been nothing but nice to you.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe that’s why I never trusted you.

HELEN
See? So rude.

ARCHIVIST
Or maybe it’s because you’re an embodiment of the fear of lies and delusion.

HELEN
Also rude.

[THE ARCHIVIST MAKES A SMALL NOISE OF DISCOMFORT]
ARCHIVIST
Could you, uh… sorry, could you manifest a room for me? Please.

HELEN
Why?

ARCHIVIST
So I can make a statement?

HELEN
You do realise it’s all me, right? If I make a room, I’ll still hear you? Because I’d be the room?

ARCHIVIST
Fine, I just thought – never mind.

[DEEP BREATH AS STATIC RISES]
[HOTEL SOUNDS NOW INCLUDE FAINT PEOPLE SOUNDS AS WELL, AND THE UNDERLYING SOUNDS OF RAGGED, HURRIED BREATHS]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I wander through the corridors, quickly, footsteps hurrying, spurred on by the worries that chase me. What were the directions she’d said, that smiling, friendly woman in reception? Left, right, right, right, left, straight ahead, then down the stairs. No, no, no, that can’t be it because I just went left and it’s a dead end. Well, not a dead end. It’s a door that says ‘Honeymoon Suite’.

HELEN
[Saucy] Currently unoccupied…

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I turn to retrace my steps. I must have taken a wrong turn.

HELEN
Just in case you and Martin were looking for a room.

[DOOR KNOCKING AND RATTLING SOUNDS NOW INTERSPERSE THE STATEMENT]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
How long… How long has Alex been alone now? On his own? Hours at least. And he’s only… Four? Five? It doesn’t matter, all that matters is I can picture his face, and he’s alone and scared without me. How could I leave my son alone in a place like this? How could I do it?

HELEN
Deadbeat mum. Classic.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
None of the doors have numbers on them, no way to know if they’re mine, even if I hadn’t lost my keys. I, I bang on each in turn and shout his name. I try the handles even though my palms ache from the blisters. Wait, blisters? How many doors have I tried?

HELEN
[Faux-concern] Oh, I’m sure it’ll be the next one.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
A flash of movement up ahead. It’s a woman. Do I… recognise her? She looks so friendly, with her wide, happy smile and her cheery voice. I tell her I need to find my son, I… I need to check out. Of course, of course, she tells me. She can help. She’d love nothing more than to help me, although she does hate to see me check out, it’s always so hard on her when guests leave.

HELEN
I like her!

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
She takes me by the arm and leads me down a narrow service staircase. As we near the bottom I hear a distant cry. Alex. I start to run, but she says no need to rush. Check-out lasts all day. That’s good to know. My arm is bleeding… When did I cut it? It’s okay, she has some bandages. I’m so lucky she’s here.

She bandages my arm, and it starts to bleed even more. Something’s wrong here. There’s something behind her smile. I look away. The dull blue paint of the staircase is gone but… I recognise the wallpaper… Where have I seen this wallpaper before?

HELEN
Nowhere special.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The corridor? I’m – No, we were on the stairs. Did we leave? No this isn’t right, it isn’t fair. I’ve got to – Wait, where is she? She was lying. Was she? She led me here, but now she’s gone and I’m… I’m so tired. When did I sleep last? No, I-I can’t sleep, I’ve got to find my son. Just keep moving, there’s only so many rooms. He has to be in one of them. Just push on, even if you have to check them all.

Ignore the blood you’re dripping on the carpet. Ignore the mirrors that try to tell you how haggard you’re growing. Ignore the laughter and the smiling and the chatter that has followed you since the reception. When did you go to reception? You can’t picture it.

HELEN
Shame, it’s very tasteful. There’s ferns.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Wait. What is that? That sound. It’s… It’s not her, not just her. There’s someone else. A man’s voice, you think. Droning on, and rising and falling as he talks and talks and talks…

[STATIC RISES AGAIN]
HELEN
Ah… Ah.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Up there, just around the corner. I can hear them. I can hear them. There!

VICTIM
Oh, oh thank god! Please, do you know where room 288 is? I… My son, he’s, I don’t know how long he’s been in there on his own, and I need to find him –

ARCHIVIST
Look, I’m so sorry. But… there is no room 288.

VICTIM
But my son!

[HELEN MANIFESTS, SMILINGLY]
HELEN
– Is around here somewhere. Come on, let’s have a look together!

VICTIM
Oh, brilliant, oh thank you, thank you so much!

HELEN
Now, where did you see him last?

VICTIM
Uh, okay. It was… it was room… wait, wait hang on.

ARCHIVIST
She’s lying to you. She isn’t your friend.

VICTIM
I… wait. I, I know you. You’re that woman from reception.

HELEN
John, this isn’t your business.

VICTIM
You were laughing! You were laughing when I got lost.

HELEN
Listen, John, I don’t come up and tell you how to pull horror from people’s brains, do I?

[THE VICTIM IS TALKED OVER AS HELEN AND THE ARCHIVIST ARGUE]
VICTIM
Please, please, I need… I need some directions.

ARCHIVIST
You do, a bit, actually, yes.

VICTIM
This place, it’s such a maze…

HELEN
Well, okay, that’s… that’s fair.

VICTIM
I don’t know how long I’ve been here.

ARCHIVIST
Look. I’m so sorry –

VICTIM
You’ve got to help me!

ARCHIVIST
[Angrily] Don’t touch me!

[THE ARCHIVIST PULLS AWAY, AS THE VICTIM FALLS AND IS CRYING]
HELEN
Oopsie. Not so easy, is it? Keeping up your humanity?

VICTIM
[Pleadingly] I’m sorry… It’s just my son…

ARCHIVIST
I could make her an avatar.

HELEN
Huh…

[THE CORRIDOORS SHIFT]
Hmmm. Best not.

[A DOOR SLAMS. ONE LAST CRY FROM THE VICTIM AS SHE VANISHES, ALONG WITH HELEN]
ARCHIVIST
Sending her away? I must have hit a nerve.

[HELEN’S VOICE RETURNS TO BEING EVERYWHERE]
HELEN
Got on my nerves. Not the same thing.

ARCHIVIST
If you say so.

HELEN
…

So, what happens now?

ARCHIVIST
You mean, did the sight of a poor, innocent wretch suffering by your hand convince me that you need to be destroyed?

HELEN
Pretty much.

ARCHIVIST
No.

You were right. It probably was something that would have convinced Martin it needed to be done.

HELEN
But…

ARCHIVIST
But I already knew what I would see in here. I already knew what I had to do.

HELEN
Because you’ve grown so fond of your old pal Helen? Or because… you were already going to destroy me?

…

I see.

ARCHIVIST
I was hoping I was wrong about you.

HELEN
You’ve always known what I am.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. But I’m only recently realising just how dangerous you are.

HELEN
Of course I’m dangerous, John. I’m a monster, just like you. and you can’t kill all of us.

ARCHIVIST
No. You’re dangerous because for all the torture and cruelty, you still somehow got us to think you’re our friend.

HELEN
I am your friend.

ARCHIVIST
No. You’re not. That’s just what you distort. It’s why you spin, but you never quite lie. The corridors, the warped body, it’s all just set dressing, isn’t it? It’s not the reality of what you actually are.

HELEN
And what, actually, am I?

ARCHIVIST
You’re a question.

HELEN
“What lurks behind the door?”

ARCHIVIST
To some. But that would be The Stranger or The Dark. No, you are the question of “What lurks behind a smile?” Is a friendship true, or is it reaching out with hands that cut you?

HELEN
Oh, I see. Very good.

ARCHIVIST
Even I didn’t see it properly, not at first. Not until the tunnels, when you wouldn’t help. When you laughed.

HELEN
Oh, come on. That wasn’t a deception, that was barely a betrayal!

ARCHIVIST
You worked to hurt us and help us, all with the same smile, until we can barely tell one from the other. Keeping us off-balance, constantly second-guessing our own opinions of you. Never quite crossing a line we could never forgive, but never putting yourself on the line either. And when one face finally stopped smiling, you just changed the face.

HELEN
Fine. So if that’s all true… why? Why would I do any of that? What’s my actual motive?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t think you even have one. It’s just what you are.

HELEN
Oh, well done. Very poetic.

ARCHIVIST
But none of that actually matters. What matters is that you want the world to stay as it is. And I don’t know if we can change it back, but if there is any possibility, you will try and stop us. And when you do, I can’t think of anyone more dangerous.

HELEN
Oh, give over! You’re the most powerful thing in the world. [Placatingly] What could I possibly do?

ARCHIVIST
It’s not me I’m worried about.

HELEN
Eurgh, fine. I thought this might happen.

ARCHIVIST
Ceaseless Watch– aargh!

[CREAKING AS THE CORRIDOORS FLEX AND CONSTRICT]
HELEN
Want to try that again?

ARCHIVIST
Ceasel–

[MORE FLEXING]
HELEN
[Darkly] You are inside my domain now, Archivist. I can shift any part of myself to any corner of this wonderful hell you have built for us. By the time the Eye focuses on me, I’m already somewhere new, something new.

[DOORS OPEN]
ARCHIVIST
Ceaseless –

[ANOTHING WARNING SHIFT]
HELEN
Whoopsie!

ARCHIVIST
You can’t do this forever!

HELEN
In this brave new world? I’m afraid I very much can.

ARCHIVIST
You can’t kill me, though. You’re just stalling.

HELEN
True. But hopefully I can stall long enough that any of your little gang that can die, have done so. By the time I let you out, you’ll have nobody else.

ARCHIVIST
…

I will end you.

[SILENCE BUT FOR SOME CREAKING]
What, nothing? No smirk? A laugh? I’ve got you rattled.

HELEN
I’m not scared of you.

ARCHIVIST
Helen… Was that… a lie?

HELEN
[Too quickly] No!

ARCHIVIST
A lie. A genuine untruth. Like a little bit of loose thread, flitting in the breeze.

HELEN
Fine. You can go.

[SHIFTING, AND A NEW DOOR OPENS]
There’s the door. Just go!

ARCHIVIST
Ceaseless Watcher!

HELEN
No!

[THROUGH THE INCANTATION, THE HARSH BUZZ OF STATIC MINGLES WITH CREAKING WOODWORK AND CRUMBLING CRICK]
ARCHIVIST
See this lie, this golden strand of falsehood. Take it in your gaze and pull it, follow through its curves and twists and knots as it unravels all before you.

HELEN (BACKGROUND)
No. No! No! No, Archivist! Stop! John, it’s me, it’s Helen. It’s me. I’ve always been your friend. Don’t do this to me. I have always helped you. I have always helped you and lent you doors. Think of all that I have done for you. If you do this, everyone inside me is dead!

ARCHIVIST
Unweave it now, its fear and its falsehood, its hidden teeth and the ones it wears so proudly.

HELEN (BACKGROUND)
You’re no different – You are no different from me! You can’t save anyone!

ARCHIVIST
Take all that it is and all that it has. It is yours!

HELEN
No! NOOOOOO!

[HELEN’S VOICE IS STRETCHED AND VANISHED]
[EXTENDED SOUNDS OF DISTORTED DEMOLITION]
ARCHIVIST
Urgh!

[A STRANGE SOUND RINGS OUT AS THE ARCHIVIST REAPPEARS IN THE WASTELAND]
MARTIN
Christ, John!

ARCHIVIST
[Groggy] Oh, Martin! Good.

MARTIN
Wh– Wh-wh-what… What happened? Th-th-there was the hotel and then…

ARCHIVIST
I, um… I killed Helen.

MARTIN
Oh.

Why?

ARCHIVIST
Long story. Ish. I’ll explain later.

MARTIN
Alright. And you couldn’t wait until you were outside?

ARCHIVIST
Not really.

MARTIN
Fair enough.

ARCHIVIST
How are you? How was… your domain?

MARTIN
Oh. Well. I mean, it feels sort of underwhelming now, to be honest. Er, more of a gentle journey of self-discovery, really. I-I didn’t realise I’m quite so… argumentative.

ARCHIVIST
I mean…

MARTIN
Y-y-you don’t need to comment.

ARCHIVIST
Alright.

MARTIN
So…

Helen’s gone, then?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[FOOTSTEPS SQUELCH AS THEY PICK THEIR WAY FORWARD]
MARTIN
Damn.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

MARTIN
Time to mourn?

ARCHIVIST
You can if you want.

…

Do you? Want to mourn?

MARTIN
…

A bit, I guess. I-I mean, she was our friend. Sort of. A bit. Until you killed her. Which I’m sure you had to do.

ARCHIVIST
Take some time if you need. But not too long.

MARTIN
Why the sudden rush?

ARCHIVIST
You see that over there?

MARTIN
Yeah?

ARCHIVIST
That’s London.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[FOOTSTEPS, AS A DISTANT DOG BARKS]
MARTIN
How much longer? Feels like we’ve been walking through suburbs forever.

ARCHIVIST
Well, quite.

MARTIN
Ah. Right. Okay. Literal suburban hellscape, then?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Endless, cookie-cutter housing. Impersonal, alienating. A common expression of The Lonely even before the world went to hell.

MARTIN
I guess.

Seems a bit, I don’t know… a bit tame compared to some of the other stuff, though.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, not to be, uh… That isn’t exactly a surprise, is it? That The Lonely seems comfortable to you?

MARTIN
Guess not.

ARCHIVIST
But if you think there’s a lack of violence or suffering, then I’m afraid you’re mistaken. There’s plenty, it’s just… hidden. Trapped behind identical doors and down silent streets of unknown neighbours. The suffering here is deep. And it’s private.

MARTIN
O-Okay, yeah, I get it. So, I guess we’re looking for an empty house? Somewhere to… ‘unburden yourself’?

ARCHIVIST
Actually no. Helen – Th-The Distortion, turns out that was… a lot of fear for the Eye. And, uh…

MARTIN
You’re still full?

ARCHIVIST
I suppose that’s one way to put it.

MARTIN
…

You still haven’t really explained what happened there.

ARCHIVIST
She tried to trap me in the corridors, so I destroyed her.

MARTIN
Yeah, I, I know, but, I mean… why?

ARCHIVIST
Probably because I told her I was going to kill her.

MARTIN
Yeah, that’d do it. Was it that bad in there?

ARCHIVIST
There were a lot of people suffering.

MARTIN
But that’s not why you did it.

ARCHIVIST
She was… She was too dangerous. She was only ever playing us.

MARTIN
So all that talk of wanting to be friends, she was just, what, lying?

ARCHIVIST
No… That was real. She did want to be friends. But she also wanted us suspicious, off-balance, uncomfortable. She wanted to be able to hurt us.

MARTIN
Bit of a contradiction, surely?

ARCHIVIST
Is it? She wanted to be our friend, she just didn’t want to be a good friend.

MARTIN
Huh. She couldn’t help what she was, I guess.

ARCHIVIST
She didn’t even try.

MARTIN
I hope the others don’t take it too hard. Melanie was pretty close to her at one point. Assuming Melanie’s still alive, of course.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. I thought you and Helen got on well, though?

MARTIN
Yeah, I… I dunno, really. She always seemed to know just the right thing to say, or the wrong thing, kind of. Like, sh-she had a way of getting into your head and making you feel like you didn’t know what the deal was. Like, like you were being stupid or something.

ARCHIVIST
Sounds about right.

MARTIN
Plus, I… I was a little bit jealous as well.

ARCHIVIST
Of what?

MARTIN
Of Helen. Well, the real Helen. I found the tape when you were on the run and… I don’t know. Something about the way you two seemed to connect when she came in.

ARCHIVIST
Before she was eaten by a door.

MARTIN
Well, Yeah. It certainly seemed to have a pretty deep impact on you.

ARCHIVIST
It did. I think… I mean, you remember how I was back then, how paranoid. The Not!Sasha was there, and I could sense something wasn’t right, but I just couldn’t place it. It left me a suspicious wreck. Then when Helen Richardson came in, it seemed like… she was in the same place I was, but worse, further along. I thought, maybe if I could help her, that would mean… maybe I wasn’t beyond help?

MARTIN
…

I’m sorry for how it worked out.

ARCHIVIST
Me too.

MARTIN
Was there any of the original Helen left in there?

[THE ARCHIVIST EXHALES WITH UNCERTAINTY]
ARCHIVIST
If there was I could never see it properly. I know that Helen Richardson was gone. The same way Michael Shelley was gone. I know The Distortion was neither of them. I also know that The Distortion of Helen was not the same being as The Distortion of Michael. But they were all so twisted up as a direct part of The Spiral. It’s like, I could follow the knowledge of any one line of identity, but as soon as I tried to take a step back and see the whole, the picture… changed.

I want to believe that thing was just wearing Helen Richardson like a mask. That I finally avenged her.

MARTIN
…

A-At least we’ll have plenty to tell the others when we meet up.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. Yeah we will.

MARTIN
Speaking of. How’s Basira doing? Where is she, at the moment?

[STATIC OF KNOWING]
ARCHIVIST
She’s trying to catch her breath in a labyrinth of masks. She hates The Stranger, but has overcome it before, and will do so again. Her path is slow and painful, but she hasn’t fallen yet.

MARTIN
Thanks. I’m, I’m trying not to worry about her.

ARCHIVIST
I know.

[FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE APACE]
ARCHIVIST
Oh. Hold on.

MARTIN
What?

[WALKING STOPS]
ARCHIVIST
We’re about to enter London proper. We should take a moment.

MARTIN
What’s it like?

ARCHIVIST
It’s the seat of The Eye. The other powers have small enclaves within it, but… it’s going to be a lot.

MARTIN
Okay. A lot of what?

[A STEP FORWARD AND THERE IS THE CRACKLE OF DOMAIN TRANSITION]
[SUBURBIA IS REPLACED WITH THE WHIRR OF IRISES FOCUSSING, SECURITY CAMERAS WHIRRING AND THE BUZZ OF DRONES]
[The archivist steps forward and a change occurs. The quiet suburb is replaced by a towering city. Faces like the windows, staring at them, security cameras focus on them. They are immediately the centre of attention. It’s Big Brother’s Big Brother.]
MARTIN
Oookay. That’s a lot of, um… Are they real?

ARCHIVIST
They’re not people. But they can see us.

MARTIN
D-Do they ever leave the windows, or…

ARCHIVIST
No. They don’t need to. They have a very good view.

MARTIN
And the cameras?

ARCHIVIST
I wouldn’t look at them too closely.

MARTIN
I won’t if they return the favour.

Okay. S-So. Do we just… start walking again?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t see why not.

MARTIN
At least there aren’t any cars.

[MORE WHIRRING, AS SPOTLIGHTS FLARE INTO LIFE WITH A HEAVY KA-CHONK SOUND]
ARCHIVIST
I suppose they don’t get many new faces around here.

MARTIN
Especially not The Archivist. You’re a celebrity!

ARCHIVIST
Maybe. Or maybe it’s Elias’ personal welcome wagon.

MARTIN
Oh. Hmm. Is that a possibility?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. I still can’t see him.

MARTIN
Then I guess we’ll find out.

ARCHIVIST
Let’s move on. I don’t need to attract any more attention.

MARTIN
Er, yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Besides, turns out I can feel a statement coming on, and I’d rather not do it with any more of an audience than absolutely necessary.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[THE ARCHIVIST’S VOICE SOUNDS MORE RESONANT FOR THESE LINES, AS IF IN A TUNNEL, THEN ADOPTS USUAL STATEMENT TONE]
ARCHIVIST
Hm. You want a show so badly?

Fine.

[STATIC RISES]
[CITY SOUNDS, INCLUDING CARS, START TO BE HEARD]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
London. Carmen hated London. She had only ever moved here because there were no jobs in her field outside of it, though right now she couldn’t have told you for certain what her field actually was. When she had first arrived she had almost convinced herself she liked it, but that had worn thin very quickly, and recently the place had changed. It felt… different.

It had always watched her; Carmen had never been under any illusions about that. Most surveilled city in the world, so much so that you didn’t even notice most of the time. She would barely register the bank of CCTV monitors on the side of the bus that cycled through angles until you were staring at the side of your own head. And she had lived next to a small park for two years before she realised the huge metal pole in the middle of the pathways wasn’t a streetlamp, but a bank of cameras.

She had once counted how many times she could spot a camera watching her during her morning run: thirty-one in ten minutes. At least, it had been back then. Last time she had tried it there were hundreds. They tracked her movements, and made so much noise she could not have ignored them if she tried. It was halfway between the mechanical whir of a focusing lens and the low rattle of mean-spirited laughter. Carmen didn’t go running anymore.

She lay in bed now, the lights of the streetlamps below her window washing out the world in a faintly green LED glow. Her curtains had long since torn, and there was nowhere to buy any more. When she turned onto her side, she could see the blinds of the flat across the street twitching, the suggestion of an observer between the slats. Carmen turned her back to the window, tried to ignore the sense that she was being watched, being judged. Her own eyes drifted to the door to her room, and she realised it was ajar. In the gap stood her flatmate, the one whose name Carmen didn’t remember, and who she couldn’t recall moving in. Straight blonde hair atop a round, friendly face that never seemed to blink.

‘It’s late,’ the flatmate said, her tone level. Carmen’s throat tightened. ‘I am trying to sleep. This is not acceptable.’

The words bit into Carmen and she felt her head swim and her heart race so fast she thought it was going to burst. What time was it? She hadn’t been making any noise, how had her flatmate known? This was her room, her space, she was allowed to be awake, she was–

Her flatmate was still there, standing in the doorway, eyes locked on her. Carmen was shaking all over, trying to keep her teeth from chattering, from making more noise that might further disturb this presence in her room. She did not sleep. And her flatmate did not move. And as the night passed, she could have sworn she heard the faintest snicker drifting from nearby windows.

[BATHROOM SOUNDS, INCLUDING THE RUNNING OF A SHOWER]
The sun came up gradually, bathing everything in the harshest of lights, every pavement crack revealed, every broken window or poorly painted façade laid bare for all to see. Carmen stared at her face in the mirror, the glow of morning reflecting back the bruised and puffy bags under her eyelids, the wrinkles that seemed to deepen every day… how many days now… and the pale weariness that almost leaked from her skin. She tried to force a smile, but her reflection just stared at her, well aware that it was false. Behind her, she saw the face of her flatmate, that same expression that dropped a hot coal of anxiety into her stomach.

‘I am waiting for the bathroom,’ the flatmate said. ‘This is not acceptable.’

[BATHROOM SOUNDS FADE, REPLACED BY THE CREAK OF A WARDROBE]
Bile rose from Carmen’s throat for just a second as the flatmate took a step closer, watching her every move, examining her for imperfections, for failures. And there were so many. Carmen pushed past her, out of the bathroom, and ran back to her room, where she tried to find clothes for the day, but everything in her wardrobe was fit only to draw attention to her. She so desperately wanted to simply disappear, just for a moment.

[DOOR SHUTS AND IS LOCKED]
A camera swivelled to focus on her the moment she left her flat, stepping onto the landing, lens extending towards her, right at eye level. She instinctively swatted at it, batting it away.

[SOFT CRUNCH OF AN IMPACT]
It was softer than she expected, and warmer, impacting the wall with a gentle pop, and leaving a sticky grey residue behind it. Carmen hurried down the stairs as the other cameras all focused on her, and other doors on the floor began to open to see what all the fuss was about. From the speed at which they opened, her neighbors must have been standing behind them. Waiting.

[HURRIED FOOTSTEPS ON CONCRETE, AS DOORS CREAK OPEN TO WATCH]
She took it two steps at a time going down, and almost tripped and fell twice, but it was better than the lift. The lift was nothing but cameras and mirrors, infinite reflections staring at each other out to all eternity and the endless multiplication of four cameras to watch it all forever. No, she wasn’t going in the lift.

[EXTERIOR DOOR OPENS TO URBAN SOUNDS]
At last she was in the street, the air of the city close, dry and tinged with that gritty texture that always made her afraid she was going to have an asthma attack. Did she have one recently? There were memories, flashes of lying on the ground, desperate for someone, anyone, to help. But they had just watched silently. Some had taken videos. But she was here now, and she couldn’t afford to have another attack today. She had somewhere very important to be.

The street outside was not crowded, which gave Carmen the briefest moment of hope. Perhaps she could make her journey in relative peace. But then the camera orb on a nearby pole swivelled to focus on her and, just like that, every single person turned towards her as one. Her stomach dropped as one by one their faces lit up, taking on that unmistakable hue of anticipation. Of recognition. Carmen could remember none of these people, but there was no ignoring the fact that they definitely knew her and, more than that, she was important to them.

‘Oh my god,’ a young man said as she tried to walk past him, ‘it’s you!’

He waited for a response, but Carmen had nothing to say, and as her feet locked in place her mind could do nothing but recite her a litany of her inadequacies, her failures, her regrets. What did he want from her? His smile turned into a sneer.

‘I should have known,’ he spat, ‘what a disappointment.’

Carmen tried to walk faster, ignoring the middle-aged woman who looked her up and down, not bothering to hide the judgement in her gaze. All she had to say was, ‘Oh.’

A little girl implored for Carmen to play with her, huge eyes pleading, but she didn’t have time.

‘You’re just like everyone said you were!’ the little girl screamed as Carmen tried to walk away. ‘No wonder Simone left you.’

Shut up, shut up, shut up, there’s no way the child could have known that. Did someone see? Of course they did, of course they were always watching, judging, knowing all her business. and there was nothing she could do to stop it. To keep them from being disappointed, to not hurt them. She just screwed up, and they all just watched her fall.

[A PEN CLICKS]
‘Sounds like you have the weight of the word on your shoulders,’ her therapist said, voice soft and mellifluous. The deep brown of her eyes met Carmen’s, and as always Carmen had to quiet the flutter of her heart, choke down and try her best to hide the seed of lust that had settled inside her long ago. But she was certain she saw a flash of contempt pass across her therapist’s face. She knew, she had seen.

‘It does feel like that,’ Carmen said. ‘There’s so much pressure, and I don’t know why.’

‘I know why’, the therapist said. ‘It’s because everyone’s counting on you. Everyone’s watching.’

Carmen was back in her room at last. She had no curtains, so pressed her mattress against the glass to keep out the light. To keep out the curiosity. Her door did not lock, so she pushed her unused desk against the flimsy MDF. To keep out her flatmate. At last she was alone. Nobody could see her. She could do what she liked and it would harm nobody.

So why didn’t she feel it? Why was there still that small, panicked buzzing in the back of her mind that told her something could see her. That she was not alone. Carmen managed not to scream, but couldn’t stop herself kicking the wall in frustration.

[A SERIES OF SMALL KICKS AGAINST A SOLID OBJECT]
The rage passed in a moment and shame hit her like a truck. Someone had seen that, she was sure of it, and what must they think of her?

On the section of wall she had kicked, a big chunk of plater crumbled to the floor, revealing the brick behind. Carmen’s brow wrinkled, first in confusion, then in horror. Set into those bricks behind the plaster was an eye. It was larger than a human eye, and flatter, almost the size of her head, and it pulsed gently.

[VAGUELY UNPLEASANT PULSING SOUNDS CAN BE HEARD FAINTLY]
The pupil was locked on her. And all at once Carmen understood how deep it went, that they were in everything, lurking in the very fabric of the world she lived in, always keeping watch on her.

It was not in rage, but in cold fury that Carmen moved the desk and marched down to the kitchen, ignoring her flatmate’s recriminations of her actions being unacceptable. She picked up a chef’s knife and returned to her room, shutting the door behind her once again.

[DOOR SLAMS]
She looked at the eye, and the eye looked back.

Carmen’s arm shot out, thrusting the tip of the blade right into the pupil. But it did not cut anything, for there was nothing but empty blackness. Carmen’s knife, then her hand, then her forearm passed into the void of that pupil, her skin bristling with the cold.

[SQUELCHING SOUND, LIKE REACHING INTO A THICK LIQUID]
And then the iris closed around her arm, the thin flesh of the tightening muscle clenching with astonishing strength as it held her in place. Then, inch by inch by inch, it began to pull her in. But her flatmate simply shushed her.

[SOUNDS OF STRUGGLING AFTER MUSCULAR CONSTRICTION]
Her terror was pointed and crimson, and tomorrow she will wake up hating London and worrying about how many characters there are.

[ONE LAST GRUNT AND WATERY STRUGGLING, AS THE STATIC RISES AGAIN]
[THE ARCHIVIST BREATHES DEEPLY]
ARCHIVIST
Is that what you wanted to hear? Why you’re all staring at me like that? You wanted a story? Or maybe I am your chosen one and you’re just waiting for your orders. I’m special to the thing upstairs, so that makes me special to all of you as well, right?

Well, let’s see if I’m worthy of your attention.

[FOOTSTEPS, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND HUM OF THE SURVEILLANCE ENVIRONMENT, AS THEY APPROACH THE PANOPTICON]
MARTIN
This is it, then.

ARCHIVIST
This is what?

MARTIN
Don’t play dumb.

It’s the final battle, right? We climb the tower, take out the bad guy, figure out how to change the world back, and back in time for tea.

Right?

ARCHIVIST
We’ve certainly got the audience for it.

MARTIN
Yeah. They did roll out the red carpet, didn’t they? Must be nice getting the star treatment.

ARCHIVIST
I’d hardly call flooding Oxford Street with blood, the “star treatment”.

MARTIN
Oh no? What would you call it?

ARCHIVIST
A very lazy metaphor.

MARTIN
Wow, you’re really determined not to engage aren’t you?

ARCHIVIST
I’m just nervous. Jonah Magnus is waiting at the top of this tower, and he obviously knows we’re coming.

MARTIN
I mean, yeah, okay, but –

ARCHIVIST
And not only that, every eye in an entire city made of nothing but eyes is staring at me while I try to prepare.

[AN AMUSED SNORT FROM MARTIN]
What?

MARTIN
[Amused] Seriously? Stage fright? The great Archivist, master of all he surveys can’t handle a bit of public attention?

ARCHIVIST
Well, clearly not.

I’m more comfortable actually doing the looking.

MARTIN
[Sarcastic] Oh, I’m so sorry John, I didn’t realise. God forbid you get uncomfortable. I guess I’ll just tell everyone it’s off then, shall I? We’ll just go.

ARCHIVIST
You don’t need to be sarcastic, okay?

MARTIN
You’re right, I’m sorry. If it’s any consolation, I’m scared too.

ARCHIVIST
That’s what concerns me.

MARTIN
I don’t follow?

ARCHIVIST
What if our fear is feeding him? Making him stronger?

MARTIN
But you’re with The Eye too, though, right? So, maybe it’s making you stronger as well.

…

John?

ARCHIVIST
[Softly] No, you’re… you’re right. Of course you’re right. I can’t believe I didn’t consider it before…

MARTIN
John? Use your words.

ARCHIVIST
Me vs Elias, Jonah. We… We both draw power from The Eye.

MARTIN
Well yeah, obviously.

ARCHIVIST
No but – That – There’s – I mean, if we face off, try to destroy each other, it’s not like it’s going to be an actual fight –

MARTIN
Hey! Don’t talk like that, okay, we can take him!

ARCHIVIST
No, Martin, listen, what I’m saying is that whichever way you cut it, ultimately it just comes down to who The Eye chooses.

MARTIN
So what, it’s just a, an eldritch popularity contest?

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Except one of the contestants is also planning to try and murder the judge.

MARTIN
…

Um.

[Searchingly] Maybe it hasn’t realised?

ARCHIVIST
Martin I… I don’t see any way I can win this. Not now, not like this.

MARTIN
[Spluttering a bit] Well, hang on, hang on, okay, let’s think about this a moment. You’re making a load of assumptions here. You can’t see inside, remember? We have no idea what’s happening up there.

ARCHIVIST
You’re right, meaning we have no idea what he’s got planned for us.

MARTIN
[Frustrated] Yeah, but that was always going to be the case, wasn’t it?

Wait, where are you going?

[FOOTSTEPS AS THE ARCHIVIST BACKS AWAY]
ARCHIVIST
We shouldn’t have come.

MARTIN
Oh, yeah, sure! We should just go with one of all those other options that we have hidden up our sleeves, yeah?

ARCHIVIST
Martin…

MARTIN
[Growing angry] No, d-d-don’t “Martin” me, okay! We’re here because it’s this or nothing, right?

ARCHIVIST
Right.

MARTIN
And we can’t do nothing, right?

ARCHIVIST
Right.

MARTIN
Great. So, lead on.

…

John?

ARCHIVIST
Um.

MARTIN
Where’s the door. John? How do we get inside this monstrosity?

ARCHIVIST
I, uh… Hm.

MARTIN
You don’t know?

ARCHIVIST
I’m, I’m not sure.

[SOUND OF EXASPERATED MARTIN]
MARTIN
Something’s probably blocking you…

ARCHIVIST
Maybe. Maybe The Eye doesn’t actually want me in there. Or, or it’s something Jonah Magnus put in place, or…

MARTIN
Or?

ARCHIVIST
Or…

MARTIN
[Sternly] Or?

ARCHIVIST
Or maybe I can’t bring myself to look. Maybe I don’t actually want to go inside.

MARTIN
[Harshly] For god’s sake John!

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

MARTIN
[Suppressed anger] No it’s –

[More calmly] I get it. It’s fine. Maybe there’s another way in? What’s this thing made of anyway, like, like, obsidian or something, right?

ARCHIVIST
One-way mirrored glass.

MARTIN
Of course it is. Well, if it’s just glass, then it won’t be hard to break, right? We can just grab something heavy, like one of these cameras, and then all I need…

ARCHIVIST
Oh, I wouldn’t.

[MARTIN GRABS SOMETHING AND THERE IS A WET, FLESHY AND YET PNEUMATIC-LIKE SOUND]
MARTIN
Oh! Oh! Eurgh…

[MARTIN GAGS]
ARCHIVIST
[Softly] Warned you.

MARTIN
[Raging] Brilliant! Just brilliant!

[GLASS IS KICKED, MULTIPLE TIMES, AND SOMETHING METALLIC ROLLS AWAY]
Argh! Damnit!

ARCHIVIST
(Quietly) Martin…

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
Look, just… just give me… Let me try to focus, tune out all these watchers. I-I’ve got a statement to make anyway.

MARTIN
Already?

ARCHIVIST
[Tired] Yes. There’s a lot here, Martin. A lot.

MARTIN
[Harshly] Fine… fine.

[More calmly] I’ll do a lap of the base. See if I can find any way in through any of the bits that used to be the Institute.

ARCHIVIST
Just be careful, okay?

MARTIN
Yeah, alright. Don’t worry about me.

Besides if anything happens… at least there’s plenty of witnesses.

ARCHIVIST
That’s not funny.

MARTIN
No.

[MARTIN SIGHS]
Be back soon.

[BRISK FOOTSTEPS AS THE SURVEILLANCE WHIRRING GETS A BIT LOUDER AND TWO SPOTLIGHTS KA-CHONK ON]
ARCHIVIST
Right, here’s your bloody performance…

[STATIC RISES]
[URBAN SOUNDS, LIKE A BUSY STREET]
[FOOTSTEPS PROCEED]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The minister hurries onwards, his eyes downcast, focusing on anything that breaks the monotony of the street. Cracks in the paving stones, boot-stomped cigarette ends, the mouldering yellow lines that snake along the pavement’s edge. Anything so that he doesn’t have to meet their gaze.

[FAINT SOUNDS OF COUGHING, SHUFFLING AND CRYING PEOPLE]
The gaunt and hollow-cheeked figures that stare at him from every corner of this blighted city that might hide them from the chill. Stick-brittle women, dresses covered in second-hand blood; old men bloated from what we sold to them as food, skin discoloured from malnourishment; and the children. God, the children. They won’t stop looking, won’t stop following him with their piteous, desperate gaze that speaks so loudly his knees feel like they will buckle. ‘Help us.’

He will. Of course he will. He wants to. He hasn’t lied to them, he really hasn’t. He used to be one of them, he remembers what it can be like. He is there to speak for them. And if necessary, he will join them again. The minister grips his black leather briefcase closely to his chest, bile rising in his throat at the sudden jolt of fear that races through his veins. Where did that come from? Is he afraid of it, returning, of that sharp stab of hunger, the shivering of a cold you can’t escape? Or is he afraid that should it come to that, they will see him as a deceiver?

But he cannot dwell solely on his worries, he tells himself – a sentiment that his journey is proving quite inaccurate. He glances at his watch, trying to hide it from his observers so that they might not see how expensive it is. He’s late, of course. The minister is always late. There are never any taxis, you see. If he was in a car, it would be alright. Then he wouldn’t have to see them, be seen by them. No, that’s not the way to look at it. These are his people, it’s important he stays connected to them. So why does it make him so afraid?

Before him rises the great shining glass palace, jagged and angular, clear crystal fogged and smeared with sweat and grease and breathy condensation, but still its denizens can be seen by the masses of the starving that crowd around the edges. They cannot help but look inside, begging and weeping and hissing and falling as they wait for somebody, anybody, to stop the things that kill them.

[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES, OUTSIDE SOUNDS DISAPPEAR]
[A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE SAVE FOR FOOTSTEPS, THEN BACKGROUND CLAMOURING AND HUBBUB IS HEARD]
The minister uses the back entrance; the stale and humid air hits him immediately, the light from the not-a-sun reflected through a dozen layers of glass. The light takes on a crimson tinge as he passes an office dried with gore, and turns away from a back room where three men in fine suits laugh among themselves as they weave their pile of nooses. Time was, the minister thinks, they’d have at least put up a curtain, a token effort to hide their intentions. But now they work in full view, unafraid of what the masses outside may see. Their lies are just as transparent; there is no choice here but to believe.

Finally, he reaches the chamber, the heart of the wretched place. Though the corridors are hard to navigate in this place of clear walls, you can always follow the sound of blustered roaring, echoing down the way. It gets louder and louder with each step, until the minister crosses the threshold into the great room, and it swallows him whole.

[THE CLAMOURING BECOMES A LOT LOUDER, A ROWDY DEBATE CHAMBER, AN INDISTINCT RABBLE]
The two sides scream and hoot and holler at each other, each on their end of the pit of sand, the arena in which they fight. The minister ignores the cobwebs in it as he makes his way to his chair. It is politer not to mention the thick layer of dust that has accumulated on the arena floor.

He takes his place, marvelling again at how comfortable the seat is, how well it seems to fit, before the memory of the eyes outside, the knowledge that he can still be seen, wipes the contented smile from his face with a jerk. He looks across the divide at his opponents: pale and gurning things that smirk and guffaw and howl. They are content and safe and happy in this place, and only scream so loud from sheer hatred of the idea that any might make noise except themselves. On their thighs can be seen the glint of gold from the great polished nails they have driven through their legs and into the chairs, gangrenous wounds that ensure they shall never have to rise again, their position utterly secure.

On his side of the arena the shouts should be sharper, more angry, but their tone and pitch are such as to merge seamlessly with the others. There are no golden stakes on this side pinning down his would-be comrades. But the minister must be careful not to look too closely, or else he might see how many of his allies are fused to their own chairs, on which they have sat comfortable for so long.

His eyes drift away, through the walls to the crowd outside. Their baying cries for justice cannot be heard in here. If any whisper should make it through, it is utterly destroyed in the deafening shouting that surrounds him. But he cannot forget their eyes, watching him, piercing him with their wounded humanity. The minister swallows, and tries to speak over the din.

At first his words are lost, vanishing into the cacophony without a ripple, but they are words, clear and distinct from the shapeless expostulation of his peers. And as he says them, one by one the others fall silent, their disgusted attention landing on him until his own voice falters in the sudden quiet.

[GRADUALLY THE VOICES RECEDE AND THE CLAMOUR STOPS]
Across the pit the pallid things gurn at him in indignant curiosity, while on his side he is surrounded by expressions of horrified betrayal.

They can all hear him now. Any words he speaks will ring out through the chamber. He wants to talk of the people outside, the bruised and abandoned ones that suffer and die to slake their appetites. He wants to cry for restitution, for justice, for a future, for anything. But all eyes are on him and he falters. He remembers the cold, the hunger, the ache of concrete beneath him. He is afraid. And his chair is so very comfortable. The minister coughs, once, uncomfortably, and sits down.

[A BELL SOUNDS, FOLLOWED BY SCUTTLING AND SOUNDS OF CROCKERY]
As he does so the great bell tolls for dinner, and a thousand scuttering servants swarm out and into the chamber, depositing their silver trays before each seat, piled high with succulent, steaming meat.

[SOUNDS OF CONSUMPTION AND CUTLERY]
The minister eats as those outside look on, and all he tastes is salt.

[STATIC RISES, AS OTHER SOUNDS FADE, AND THE PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENT RESUMES]
MARTIN

ARCHIVIST
Yes. Just, uh… Left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.

Shut up!

GEORGIE
It’s alright, John. Just keep quiet.

ARCHIVIST
Wha– Georgie? Melanie? I thought – This –

MARTIN
[Whispering] Sorry. Sorry, John. Not sure how much everything up there actually understood what was going on. But, y’know, I didn’t want to take any chances so it made sense to… um…

ARCHIVIST
Put on a show?

MARTIN
Yeah, basically, more or less.

GEORGIE
Martin says it’s much harder for you to avoid attention up there.

MELANIE
Another reason we should have left them up there. Still. Glad you’re alive and that.

ARCHIVIST
Likewise, I… oh… Ooo…

MELANIE
Oh, I know that sound. He’s going pale, right? Five quid says he’s about to collapse again.

ARCHIVIST
[Archly] I am not going to collapse. What do you mean again?

MELANIE
Oh come on. You do it all the time.

ARCHIVIST
[Brokenly] I do not – I’m just feeling a little bit woozy alright? I ca-can’t quite think straight. Like at, um… um, Martin, you remember?

GEORGIE
Is this what you were talking about?

MARTIN
Yeah, if something messes with his connection, he can get a little… vague.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t like being discussed like I’m not here.

MELANIE
Then you are going to love the others.

MARTIN
What others?

GEORGIE
There’s a small group of… survivors we managed to pull out of some of the nearby hells. They, um… They think we’re… ‘special’. You know, because The Eye can’t see us.

MELANIE
It’s fine, Georgie. You can use the “c” word.

MARTIN
E-Excuse me?

GEORGIE
Fine. We’ve got, sort of a… cult.

MARTIN
Wh– Ooooh… kay…

ARCHIVIST
That’s… not what I was expecting.

MELANIE
Mmhmm. It’s extremely weird.

GEORGIE
It wasn’t intentional. It just sort of happened. Although… I have to admit it can be useful, occasionally.

ARCHIVIST
Okay, this is, uh… this is a-a lot. Why don’t we take it from the top?

GEORGIE
Alright.

ARCHIVIST
You’re alive!

GEORGIE
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Good.

MELANIE
I keep telling her that technically there’s no proof of that.

ARCHIVIST
I’m really glad.

MARTIN
Friendly faces have been kind of rare. Or weird.

ARCHIVIST
H-How are you here? What, what happened?

GEORGIE
When the world started to change, it just didn’t hit me and Melanie. Not, not really.

MELANIE
Georgie’s got that fearless thing going on, and me and The Eye, well, you remember our messy divorce.

ARCHIVIST
Sure.

GEORGIE
We figured you’d know what was going on, so we headed for the Institute, but it was, um, well, you saw it up there. We couldn’t find you, and by the time we arrived the world was full nightmare.

MELANIE
There was nowhere to go back to, so I told her about the tunnels. Turns out, not only were they still here, they actually do a decent job of hiding things. When you aren’t painting a huge target on our backs.

GEORGIE
Melanie…

MELANIE
[Sharply] What? I’m here, aren’t I? I didn’t say anything about being nice about it.

GEORGIE
No you didn’t.

MELANIE
So… let me moan.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry to cause a fuss.

MELANIE
[Snorts] Bit late for that.

MARTIN
How did you know we were there?

GEORGIE
How could we not? The entire city knows you were there.

MELANIE
[Sarcastically] Everyone is so excited to see the Ceaseless Watcher’s special little boy.

[GIGGLES]
ARCHIVIST
Yes, well.

GEORGIE
Always did enjoy being the centre of things.

[LAUGHS]
ARCHIVIST
So, what’s next?

MARTIN
Well, I vote we catch up somewhere that’s maybe not quite so close to the sinister mega-tower.

GEORGIE
Not so fast. Is it safe? If we take you to the others, is that going to put them in danger?

MARTIN
Um. Oh, er…

ARCHIVIST
No. No, I don’t think it will.

MELANIE
[Intensely] I’m going to hold you to that.

GEORGIE
…

Fine. Come on then.

MARTIN
Oh, uh, er, Melanie, do you need a hand or…

MELANIE
No. No, I’m fine. Somehow managed to keep my cane through all of this.

[RATTLES CANE]
And I know this part of the tunnels pretty well. Besides, do you even have a torch?

MARTIN
Oh, uh, no, not anymore, we lost it when –

Yeah, I don’t like th–

Hang on, listen.

[FAINT SOUNDS OF TAPPING AND FOOTSTEPS, FOLLOWED BY CLOSER STEPS AND DOOR CREAKS]
[Relieved] Oh thank god.

LAVERNE
That them?

CELIA
Yeah. And they’re with a couple of new people! I don’t recognise them!

LAVERNE
Well, that explains it, doesn’t it?

[TAPPING IS LOUDER NOW]
CELIA
[Whispered shout] Georgie! Melanie! Over here!

ARCHIVIST
[Faint, amused] First name terms with the prophets? Bit disrespectful.

GEORGIE
[Faint] John.

ARCHIVIST
[Faint] Sorry.

[SOUNDS OF ENTRY AND SOME MUMBLING]
LAVERNE
Glad to see you’re okay. We were getting worried.

ARCHIVIST
[Quiet] After you.

GEORGIE
[Teasing] Oh, were you? Both of you?

CELIA
[Plaintive] I’m allowed to care!

[FOOTSTEPS AND SMALL MOVEMENTS AS FOLKS SETTLE THEMSELVES]
GEORGIE
Where’re the others?

LAVERNE
I think Arun’s off writing. The rest are sleeping.

ARCHIVIST
You can sleep here?

MELANIE
You don’t have to, but it does pass the time.

[MELANIE SETTLES INTO A CHAIR]
MARTIN
This place is pretty nice.

MELANIE
Yeah, I reckon it used to be a hideout of, um, you-know-who, uh, when he was living down here. It had supplies and everything.

CELIA
Sorry, we haven’t been introduced, you are…?

GEORGIE
Oh, um, of course, sorry. This is –

ARCHIVIST
Jonathan. John. Sims.

MARTIN
Uh, Martin. Hello!

GEORGIE
And this is Laverne.

LAVERNE
Good to meet you.

GEORGIE
And Celia.

MARTIN
[Puzzled] Celia?

CELIA
Probably. The, um… place I was trapped in, they took my name. I never got it back. But I like Celia, so… yeah! Celia it is.

MARTIN
Uh… H-Hello… Celia.

CELIA
So, where were you two then?

ARCHIVIST
Er… Pardon?

CELIA
They saved you, right? From one of the nightmares? So, what was it?

ARCHIVIST
Oh…

LAVERNE
Celia, don’t push. They can tell us when they’re ready.

[DISCOMFITED SOUNDS FROM MARTIN]
GEORGIE
Uh, no, they’re, they’re not –

We didn’t rescue them.

LAVERNE
No? So where did they come from?

MELANIE
[Pointedly] Great question. John, do you want to field that one?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, right, okay. Well, um… We were… We’re from out there. We’ve been wandering the world. Seeing all its horrors.

LAVERNE
God, that sounds awful.

MARTIN
Er… Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
But we’re old friends of your… uh, prophets.

CELIA
[Embarrassed] Oh, um… they don’t like it when you call them that.

MELANIE
[Emphatically] We haven’t prophesied anything.

ARCHIVIST
Well, that’s a fair point. I suppose, technically, ‘saviours’ would be the correct –

MELANIE
Oh, shut up! John!

GEORGIE
Anyway… they’re passing through. They won’t be staying with us long.

MARTIN
Oh, er, right. Yes.

LAVERNE
Hang on… Sims…

Melanie, this isn’t your old boss?

ARCHIVIST
I – What?

MELANIE
I used to talk about you in therapy.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Oh! Oh, I suppose that makes sense.

GEORGIE
Hmmm.

LAVERNE
Small world… Nice to finally put a face to the name.

ARCHIVIST
Uh, yes.

Yes.

CELIA
[Uncomfortable] Right.

Oh, Georgie, I mean to – Sorry, um, just –

[PAPERS RUSTLE]
Do you know what this is doing here? I haven’t seen it before, and you’re always saying to tell you anything weird so…

GEORGIE
I see…

Thank you Celia. Could you turn that off, please.

[FOOTSTEPS]
[Brusquely] John, a word?

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
GEORGIE
Yeah, look and I understand that, but you’ve got to realise this isn’t just –

ARCHIVIST
Uh, Georgie?

GEORGIE
Oh, seriously? For fu–

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
GEORGIE
No, they can piss off! No! I refuse.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[REPEATED SOUNDS OF ENTHUSIASTIC TAPE RECORDER SMASHING]
GEORGIE
I can do this all day!

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
GEORGIE
[Breathlessly] For god’s sake!

ARCHIVIST
Georgie, it’s not going to make a difference.

GEORGIE
I’m not going to let us be spied on, John!

ARCHIVIST
Look, the tunnels offer some protection, but clearly not enough to stop whatever is manifesting these recorders. If you smash this one, they’ll just make another one. Trust me on this, you need to let it go.

[DISGRUNTLED SOUND FROM GEORGIE WHILE TAKING MOMENT TO RECOMPOSE]
GEORGIE
There are seven with us now.

[Sigh] It used to be more, a lot more. But… um, we got greedy, pulled too many out. We… attracted attention. And… well, now there are seven.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

GEORGIE
Martin said you knew everything now.

ARCHIVIST
Not everything. Between the tunnels, and your and Melanie’s… position relative to The Eye… I’m a bit in the dark here.

GEORGIE
No pun intended.

ARCHIVIST
Sure.

GEORGIE
…

So what? You, just, want me to just leave the tapes running and hope?

ARCHIVIST
I want you to accept that trying to stop them listening is only going to frustrate you.

GEORGIE
Just promise me these things aren’t going to harm my people.

ARCHIVIST
I promise… I promise that they’re not here for you. They’re here for me. And maybe a bit for Martin. They seem to like him.

GEORGIE
That’ll have to do, I guess.

…

It’s good to see you.

ARCHIVIST
You too.

GEORGIE
I, um… I think I owe you an apology.

ARCHIVIST
Oh?

GEORGIE
I didn’t realise how bad things were for, well, all of you. I mean, I kind of knew, but seeing all this for myself, I… I cut myself off and… I’m not so sure that was the right thing to do any more.

ARCHIVIST
You had every right to.

GEORGIE
Yeah, but it didn’t exactly help, did it?

ARCHIVIST
Georgie, you couldn’t have stopped this, believe me.

GEORGIE
…

Melanie reckons you’re the reason… all this happened, whole apocalypse thing.

ARCHIVIST
[Sigh] She’s… not wrong.

[LONG EXHALATION FROM GEORGIE]
I was the catalyst. I-I didn’t – Elias – Jonah Magnus used me.

GEORGIE
Well, obviously. Even Melanie doesn’t think you’d have been stupid enough to do this on purpose.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Good.

So… this is it? You and Melanie sneak into nearby fearscapes, rescue someone and hide them here?

GEORGIE
Well, it’s a bit more complicated than that, but… yeah, basically.

ARCHIVIST
And then you just… stay down here?

GEORGIE
These days, that’s enough. We still need to eat sometimes, and drink. Found some supply caches down here –

ARCHIVIST
Jurgen Leitner.

GEORGIE
Yeah, that’s, that’s what Melanie said too.

Also, uh, we found a pretty convenient nightmare that’s essentially just an endless supermarket. Turns out if you take stuff from it, it stays pretty much fine. Not nice, y’know, but, y’know…

ARCHIVIST
I did wonder about the ‘Ennui’-brand coke bottles.

GEORGIE
Yeah, it’s convenient, not subtle.

ARCHIVIST
…

Georgie… Where’s the Admiral?

GEORGIE
[With difficulty] He’s, uh… he’s fine. I guess. He’s enjoying himself, at least. He wasn’t immune, not like me and Melanie. And he’s a predator, pampered piece of fluff that he is.

Turns out, there’s a place full of cats. And their prey.

ARCHIVIST
Poor thing.

GEORGIE
I go to see him sometimes. I think he’s happy, in his way. But, um… It’s hard to see him like that. He didn’t even know I was there.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry.

GEORGIE
…

John… How do we turn it back?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
MELANIE
Was that the recorder?

MARTIN
Yeah, it just started.

MELANIE
By itself?

MARTIN
I didn’t do it, if that’s what you’re asking!

MELANIE
It wasn’t an accusation.

MARTIN
Do you want me to turn it off?

MELANIE
That depends. Will it stay off?

MARTIN
Not if it wants to be a part of things, no.

MELANIE
Then let it run. It’s just the two of us, and it’s not like we can attract any more attention to ourselves at this point, inviting the snoop-god’s favourite kid down for a chat.

MARTIN
Hey, that’s not fair.

MELANIE
And? I guess the end of the world must’ve left me all snappy.

MARTIN
Well… I mean, y–

MELANIE
Don’t. Don’t say it. I actually did a lot of work on my anger, you know? Tried to put all the supernatural bollocks behind me. And now my therapist thinks I’m ‘the chosen one’.

MARTIN
Yeah, the apocalypse does seem to bring out the weird in people.

[SOUND OF ASSENT]
MELANIE
Speaking of… uh, you and John, eh?

MARTIN
Hmm?

MELANIE
Congrats, took you long enough.

MARTIN
Oh god! I totally forgot I haven’t even seen you since… well…

MELANIE
Yeah. Not… not since before John woke up.

Before you, uh… cut yourself off.

MARTIN
Yeah, sorry about that.

MELANIE
Look, I, I get it. I was still full of ghost bullet at the time, remember?

MARTIN
Oh yeah. I suppose, when you think about – I mean… Do we actually know each other? Really?

MELANIE
Huh.

Uh, Melanie.

MARTIN
Martin.

[HANDSHAKE]
[Playfully] So… what do you do?

MELANIE
[Playing along] Oh, um… [chuckle] I’m actually one of the prophets chosen to walk the end times unscathed.

MARTIN
Mmm. Mmm.

MELANIE
Yourself?

MARTIN
Oh, I’m the antichrist’s plus one.

[MELANIE CHORTLES]
MELANIE
Oh, that… that sounds like a rough gig.

MARTIN
[Smiling] It has its perks.

Seriously though, how the hell did you and Georgie fall into the ‘prophet’ thing.

[HEAVY SIGH]
MELANIE
Okay, um… It wasn’t exactly a choice. It just turns out that since I… severed my connection with The Eye, y’know, and Georgie has no fear, we’re kind of… invisible to all the nonsense out there. We only realised when we finally went out to see what was going on… saw how bad it was…

MARTIN
Yeah. It’s the same outside London. Worse, in some places. Though I guess that’s down to personal taste these days.

MELANIE
Yeah.

Well, we were, we were out, and we found this Spiral maze, uh, and who did we find inside but Laverne, my therapist. I wasn’t exactly going to leave her there, so we grabbed her and legged it. And… that’s when we discovered we can keep others hidden as well. Not completely and not for long, but it’s enough to get them here to the tunnels. So once we realised that, we started doing it for more people.

…

Have you had to explain any of this stuff to somebody who just doesn’t have the first clue about any of it?

MARTIN
Not often. And it never went great.

MELANIE
Yeah, well, tell you what, you sound like a doomsday-ing tarot reader.

Hours talking about The Eye’s ‘ascendance’, and how it’s, y’know, transforming the world into a fearful ‘psychoscape’ and…

MARTIN
They didn’t believe you?

MELANIE
Oh, I wish. No, they believed us, but a few of them took it in a bit more of a… religious direction. And here we are.

MARTIN
Mmmm. Okay but I still don’t get the whole ‘prophet’ business. What exactly are you meant to have predicted?

[ANOTHER HEAVY SIGH]
MELANIE
Okay, um…I… [sigh] I said I’d had a vision that it would end.

MARTIN
Oh. Right. And er… have you had a vision or…

…

Right.

MELANIE
Look, I know, alright. [sigh] It was a shitty thing to do, but… if you had heard how, how hopeless they all were, like, when we told them all this. That everyone is trapped in, like, never-ending torment, forever… I had to tell them something.

MARTIN
I guess.

MELANIE
I hate it. They just keep trying to interpret everything I do. And they keep calling me “The Blind Prophet”, which is a whole other thing!

MARTIN
Er, yikes.

MELANIE
Yeah, uh-huh!

It’s why we head out so much. Sometimes we actually are scouting or gathering, but half the time… I just need to get away. If I didn’t have Georgie, I think I might just snap and beat them all to death.

MARTIN
Sounds like they’d probably thank you for your wisdom, if you did that.

MELANIE
[chuckle] Stop! We shouldn’t talk about them like this. They, they are good people.

MARTIN
Sure.

MELANIE
It’s just… hard not to look down on people when they put you up on a pedestal like that.

MARTIN
So how are you and Georgie doing?

MELANIE
Honestly? Er, well, these were not the early relationship hurdles I expected.

MARTIN
God, tell me about it.

MELANIE
But don’t get me wrong… Georgie’s incredible. Um, and she’s, and she’s far, far too good for me. And I, I only hope she doesn’t realise that while there’s an apocalypse on.

[HEAVY SIGH]
Yeah.

And what about John?

MARTIN
Oh, you know John. He’s a complete mess. But, so am I and… I think we’re making it work. Communication can be… difficult when you’re on an unholy pilgrimage.

MELANIE
Modern dating, eh?

MARTIN
Nightmare.

[MELANIE CHUCKLES, THEN EXHALES LOUDLY]
MELANIE
Um…  Did you meet anyone else out there?

MARTIN
Yeah, loads actually. In fact we…  we saw Basira and Daisy.

MELANIE
Are – Are they alright?

MARTIN
No. Not really.

MELANIE
Oh.

MARTIN
Daisy had kind of gone full monster.

MELANIE
Ah.

MARTIN
And Basira kind of… had to kill her.

MELANIE
Oh. Oh… Oh that’s…

MARTIN
Yeah. So, now Basira’s on her way, but she’s taking her own route. I think she needed some time to process.

MELANIE
Well, that, that makes sense. Although I’m not sure how much ‘processing’ she’ll manage out there surrounded by – Oh! Oh, I nearly forgot! Careful of Helen, if you see her. She turned up a while back and tried to eat Celia.

MARTIN
She was here?

MELANIE
Yes… a few times. Looking back, I was so stupid!

MARTIN
Because you kind of liked her?

MELANIE
Yes. Yes…  Honestly I had started to think she was on our side.

MARTIN
Yeah.

[MELANIE SIGHS]
John killed her.

MELANIE
Uh, sorry, what?!

MARTIN
Yeah, she tried to – I wasn’t there, but they got into a standoff and he… he destroyed her.

MELANIE
He can do that?

[SOUND OF MARTIN’S ASSENT]
Well. I mean that’s… that’s interesting to know. Ah –

MARTIN
Oh yeah, it’s a who–

[WOODEN KNOCKING]
MELANIE
Oh, oh god, I forgot. I-I promised I’d listen to some of Arun’s latest stuff.

MARTIN
No worries, do you want some company?

MELANIE
I wouldn’t put you through that.

[MARTIN SNORTS]
[Quietly] I swear, if it’s another hymn I am going to break something!

[FOOTSTEPS AS MELANIE LEAVES]
[MARTIN PAUSES, SIGHS AND THEN MAKES HIMSELF COMFORTABLE]
MARTIN
Ooooooh. Mmm, that’s nice.

[FOOTSTEPS, AND WOODEN CREAK]
LAVERNE
Careful, she’s very possessive of that chair.

MARTIN
Oh sorry! Didn’t mean to sit on the prophet’s throne.

[LAVERNE CHUCKLES]
LAVERNE
I just wanted to check if you were joining us for dinner?

MARTIN
Oh, food! What’s on the menu?

LAVERNE
Cold baked beans.

MARTIN
Maybe later.

LAVERNE
It’s there if you want it.

MARTIN
Do you actually believe all that stuff?

LAVERNE
About them being chosen?

MARTIN
Yeah, the whole ‘prophet’ thing.

LAVERNE
Are you asking me personally, or do you want me to speak for the group?

MARTIN
Either. Both.

LAVERNE
Hmm. Personally, I don’t know what I believe. I saw Melanie every week for months, and if you’d asked if I thought she was a ‘holy person’, I’d have laughed. She always behaved understandably, even if her problems were sometimes… odd.

MARTIN
But…?

LAVERNE
But. The world is… well, I mean, it’s hell, isn’t it? Whether it’s a capital-H hell or not, I don’t know, but that’s where we are. And Melanie and Georgie, they can walk through it completely untouched. They can… rescue people, even if they can’t always protect them. I’ve listened to their own explanation of it, and I’ve listened to Danielle call them “prophets” or “angels” or “the chosen”. Neither of them really makes any sense. But… you’ve got to have hope in something, otherwise there’s no point to anything. So, I choose to have hope in them.

MARTIN
I guess that makes sense.

LAVERNE
It doesn’t need to. Times like these, it just helps to believe. I’m not sure it really matters what.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
ARUN
[Earnest] So what do you think?

GEORGIE
[Awkward] Um…

MELANIE
[Awkward] Oh, okay, um… Right, so… Arun, I just think that the…

GEORGIE
I don’t think either of us is particularly comfortable with your use of the word “redeemers”.

MELANIE
Right.

ARCHIVIST
I thought it was quite a good rhyme.

MELANIE
[aside] Shut up, John!

ARUN
I-I, I realise that you dislike that k-kind of thing, your humility is… humbling.

[THE FRAGILE LINE OF MELANIE’S IRRITATION IS AUDIBLE]
But… I’ve been considering your words last week, when you talked about how the world we’re in… feeds on fear, how –

GEORGIE
Mmhmm…

ARUN
– how it’s powered and shaped and moulded by it.

GEORGIE
Right…

ARUN
And, well, maybe your powers feed on hope? On trust and faith and… and hope. I want to inspire that. So, I’m sorry if maybe it’s a little… florid, but I think it’s right.

MELANIE
That’s… that’s not how it works. Is it? John?

ARCHIVIST
Oh? No. That’s not how it works.

ARUN
[Sharply] And what would you know about poetry?

[GEORGIE GIGGLES]
ARCHIVIST
Oh, well, uh… I, um…

ARUN
Who even is this? Are you a new follower? I thought you said it was dangerous for the flock to get any bigger?

GEORGIE
Ah, no. He’s… like us. Able to travel through the world.

ARUN
Another nightmare strider?

ARCHIVIST
I do not want a poem.

[MORE SOFT GIGGLES]
ARUN
But… Are, are, are you sure, Prophet?

MELANIE
Uh… yes. Yes he is.

ARUN
He doesn’t seem holy…

ARCHIVIST
[Archly] And what would you know?

GEORGIE
John.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry.

ARUN
I – Apologies, I meant, I meant no offence. Oh, I – Please forgive me!

[FOOTSTEPS AS ARUN LEAVES]
GEORGIE
You didn’t need to scare him like that.

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t mean to.

MELANIE
Hmm.

GEORGIE
Look, we’re all tired, and you still seem a little disoriented by the tunnels. Let’s get some rest. We can talk about next moves tomorrow.

ARCHIVIST
And how do you know when tomorrow is?

GEORGIE
We generally err on the side of caution and sleep in.

ARCHIVIST
Sounds good.

GEORGIE
Oh, John.

ARCHIVIST
Hmm?

GEORGIE
Your tape’s running again.

ARCHIVIST
[Muzzily] Mm, what? What? What is it? What…?

MARTIN
Sorry. Sorry, I – It’s fine. I was… I was just startled. We’ve not been many places you can sleep, so I –

ARCHIVIST
So, what?

MARTIN
You were sleeping with your eyes open again.

ARCHIVIST
Ah. Right.

MARTIN
J-just took me by surprise.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry. Not something I can help, I’m afraid.

MARTIN
No, I, I know. I know. I’m sorry. It’s okay.

[MARTIN SIGHS]
[FABRIC RUSTLES]
ARCHIVIST
Bad dream?

MARTIN
Is there any other kind?

ARCHIVIST
Fair.

MARTIN
Speaking of, how are your dreams? I know they used to be… y’know, complicated.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. I don’t really remember them anymore. Honestly, it’s not really even sleep these days. I can only do it when I’m disconnected from… well everything, and it’s more like… You know that feeling when you’re right on the edge of falling asleep? Not quite dreaming, but not aware of stuff either?

MARTIN
Huh. So, like, standby mode then?

ARCHIVIST
[Soft laugh] I suppose.

What was I like at Salesa’s?

MARTIN
Oh, you’d just completely conk out. Eyes open, obviously, cos god forbid the creepy ever stops entirely, heh, but –

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

MARTIN
– you’d just be dead to the world. I actually got a bit worried, once or twice, but you always woke up fine. You said you didn’t dream. Sounded pretty happy about it too.

ARCHIVIST
I imagine I was.

MARTIN
…

Hey, I meant to ask. Do you recognise that woman, Celia?

ARCHIVIST
Um… no, I, I don’t think so. Why?

MARTIN
I’d swear she gave a statement once.

ARCHIVIST
What statement? I don’t… remember anything. Wh– Not down here at least.

MARTIN
It was… [mumbles something softly]

I thought she was making stuff up! Heh. I gave her some money.

ARCHIVIST
Why?

MARTIN
Sh-she asked.

ARCHIVIST
Right. Do you think she remembers?

MARTIN
I mean, she doesn’t seem to remember her own name, so I’m guessing… No?

ARCHIVIST
You could ask?

MARTIN
Well, no, that’d just be weird. I mean –

[SOFT WOODEN KNOCKING]
Hello?

[DOOR OPENS]
UNNAMED
Sorry. Didn’t wake you, did I? They asked me to check in on you.

ARCHIVIST
No, it’s fine, we were up.

MARTIN
Don’t think we’ve met. I’m Martin, this is John.

[RUSTLING AND SOUNDS OF BAG OPENING AS THEY START MOVING AROUND]
ARCHIVIST
Hello.

UNNAMED
[Suspicious] Right.

MARTIN
And you are…?

UNNAMED
[Firmly] No.

MARTIN
“No”? As in your name’s No?

UNNAMED
No, as in ‘you don’t get to know my name’. I’m not stupid.

ARCHIVIST
Is that so?

UNNAMED
Names are how they see you; they’re how they find you in the files. You can hide all you want, but if they know your name, they can see you. And take you away.

ARCHIVIST
I see.

UNNAMED
I tell people my name, then maybe they learn it. Then they come for all of us. You shouldn’t have told me yours. I keep telling the others! Only the prophet names are safe.

ARCHIVIST
That’s not how it works!

MARTIN
[warning] John…

ARCHIVIST
What? She’s talking complete rubbish!

UNNAMED
Have you been there, then? Have you fled through the endless cabinets, the, the labels that cut you? The things that ‘put you in your place’?

ARCHIVIST
No…

UNNAMED
So you don’t know!

ARCHIVIST
But I’ve seen it!

I know it.

UNNAMED
Oh, you know it, do you? Did it bleed you?

ARCHIVIST
No, but that’s not actually –

UNNAMED
Then you don’t know it. And you’re not getting my name.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. Sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.

…

So… Georgie and Melanie, are they…?

UNNAMED
They’re gone.

Out.

They, they often go out. Sometimes they bring people back, but usually they just go, for a while.

MARTIN
O-kay. Do you know when they’ll be back?

UNNAMED
No. They walk their own path.

ARCHIVIST
Of course they do.

[PAUSE, THEN UNNAMED SIGHS]
UNNAMED
Would you like some food? We have… tins. And biscuits. Although the biscuits are really old.

MARTIN
What’s in the ‘tins’?

UNNAMED
Food.

MARTIN
[Irritated] What food?

UNNAMED
Depends. Most of the labels are gone. Yesterday, I got black beans.

MARTIN
Oh right. And that’s… good?

UNNAMED
Mmhmm.

[MARTIN EXHALES SLOWLY]
MARTIN
Right. Well, I could probably go for a… tin. John?

ARCHIVIST
Any chance you could bring me something back? I’m feeling a little shaky.

MARTIN
Do you need to make a statement?

ARCHIVIST
Actually no. I haven’t since we got down here. I suppose it must be the tunnels. Nice to be a bit more in control, although it does feel… odd.

MARTIN
Well, it’s good to hear. I’ll see what I can find.

UNNAMED
Are you coming?

Yes, yes. Lead the way… you.

Of course.

Arun.

MARTIN
Hi Arun, what’s up?

ARUN
Sorry, ju… um, just, um, did you lose a tape recorder? I found this – Oh… Huh.

MARTIN
Yeah, it wasn’t on when you found it, right?

[SLIGHT CHUCKLE]
ARUN
No. Is it yours? I haven’t seen it before, I thought it might be.

MARTIN
Kind of, I guess? They follow us around a bit.

ARUN
Really?

MARTIN
Oh, y-you don’t need to worry. It’s been happening for ages. Before the world changed, even. You can just ignore them.

ARUN
Since before the end?

MARTIN
Yeah, it’s… it’s kind of a long story. Ask the prophets, if you want, they’ll explain.

[TURNS AND STEPS AWAY]
ARUN
You don’t believe in them, do you? In their power?

MARTIN
I… knew them in the old days.

ARUN
So did Laverne.

MARTIN
Yeah, I, I realise that. Just –

Look, it’s complicated, okay? It’s just a big pile of stuff that no-one understands.

ARUN
[Pointedly] I understand they are able to walk through this world without fear or danger. I understand they saved us.

[MARTIN EXHALES HIS IRRITATION]
MARTIN
Cool.

…

Look, you, you should really talk to them about it, okay, I don’t want to say the wrong thing.

ARUN
They said… you also walked through the nightmares. That you ‘share their power’.

MARTIN
Ooh, I’m not sure…

It’s different, alright? W-We’re different.

ARUN
Yes. You are.

When I look at them, I see a future. I see hope. I don’t know what I see when I look at you.

[NOISES OF DISBELIEF FROM MARTIN]
MARTIN
Okay, well… You’re rude.

ARUN
I’m a poet. I speak the truth.

MARTIN
Yeah? Well… your truth is rude! You don’t know anything about us. Who we are, what we’re doing.

ARUN
I know you look at us like we’re idiots. [Martin snorts] You pity us.

MARTIN
That’s not true.

ARUN
Liar!

[Raised voice] Who are you? Just appearing from nowhere with… phantom tape recorders just scuttling in your wake? Why are you here?

MARTIN
[Agitated] We’re here to save the world, okay? Right? If you want more than that, go ask your prophets, okay? Now just… Give me that!

[DOOR OPENS ON MARTIN’S RETURN; TINS ARE PLACED DOWN]
ARCHIVIST
Any sign of them?

MARTIN
No, but the others say it’s pretty normal for them to be gone this long.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[CUTLERY SOUNDS]
MARTIN
That said, the, uh, ‘locals’ are getting restless.

ARCHIVIST
Mmm.

MARTIN
I get the impression our welcome isn’t exactly unconditional.

How’s the, uh, fuzziness?

ARCHIVIST
It’s alright. Comes and goes.

MARTIN
Yeah, you don’t seem as bad as you were at Salesa’s. Hopefully you won’t forget everything as soon as you leave the tunnels.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t think I will. It was worse there, though, obviously…

MARTIN
You don’t remember.

ARCHIVIST
I don’t remember.

…

So, what do you think? You reckon they’re going to help?

MARTIN
I mean, they’ve got to, right? You-You’re basically humanity’s only hope.

ARCHIVIST
Huh, I mean… okay, um… [nervous chuckle] I hadn’t really –

MARTIN
Oh s-sorry! That’s probably a bit too much pressure, yeah?

ARCHIVIST
A-A bit?

MARTIN
I-I just meant that, look, either they help or they just sit down here and hope it all magically works itself out. And they can’t really think that’s an option.

Can they?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know. I know how Georgie gets about people in her care. If she thinks helping us will endanger them…

MARTIN
Yeah. Melanie too.

ARCHIVIST
Mmm.

MARTIN
And you’re sure we can’t find the way up on our own?

ARCHIVIST
Probably not. I’m cut off down here, and the layout seems… different to before.

MARTIN
The Eye isn’t, like, calling you, or something?

ARCHIVIST
Oh, no it is. But I can’t get a clear reading on it down here. It’s kind of maddening, actually. Like being on a street you almost remember but can’t find on a map.

MARTIN
We might have to just try anyway.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah, but without a guide we could be wandering a long time. And apparently there are things wandering about there as well that… might put up some resistance.

MARTIN
Yeah, Laverne mentioned. Do you know what they are?

ARCHIVIST
Yep. They’re, um… They’re Archivists.

MARTIN
Come again?

ARCHIVIST
Did you ever listen to Gertrude’s interview with, uh, Sergeant Heller?

MARTIN
Oh… that’s a blast from the past. Uhhh, I think so? Uh, World War Two, right? Under Alexandria? Saw some monster with a wei–

ARCHIVIST
Mmhmm.

MARTIN
…eye. Right.

ARCHIVIST
I’m not the first Archivist. Not by a long way. Most of the others died like Gertrude, but some… lingered, and, well, let’s just say I’m not the only one that feels the Panopticon calling.

MARTIN
Right.

…

John. If… When we defeat The Eye, the fears… What happens to you?

ARCHIVIST
Nothing good.

I think it depends on what actually happens. If we figure out a way to defeat them, banish them somehow, kick them out of our reality, and back to where they came from, I might… survive. I think I’d stay more or less like this. W-Weaker, but fundamentally still an avatar in a world where the fears are once again lurking on the edges.

MARTIN
But I assume that’s the best case scenario?

ARCHIVIST
Depends on your point of view, I suppose. In the long term all we’d have done is bought some more time.

If, however, we find a way to somehow destroy or, uh, eliminate the powers… I’m not going to be okay. There’s too much of me that’s part of The Eye now. I don’t… know what would be left of me without it. Maybe I just die. Maybe I survive, but I lose… something. My identity. My mind. My… memories. I don’t know.

[FABRIC RUSTLES AS THEY EMBRACE]
Martin, when the time comes, I need you to promise me that you won’t try to stop me.

MARTIN
I promise.

I love you, John.

ARCHIVIST
I love you too.

MARTIN
But I’m not going to doom the world over it.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

MARTIN
And you have to promise me you’re going to do everything in your power to live. That you’re not going to sacrifice yourself at the first opportunity, just because you feel guilty about what happened

ARCHIVIST
…

I promise.

MARTIN
Good.

God, I hate these conversations.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

Heavy stuff.

MARTIN
I miss small talk.

ARCHIVIST
We could talk about the weather for a bit I-if you like?

MARTIN
Bit difficult underground.

ARCHIVIST
True. In that case I might see if I can get a bit more sleep. Rest up a bit before… you know.

MARTIN
Sure.

ARCHIVIST
Wake me if they get back?

MARTIN
Of course.

[FOOTSTEPS AND CANE TAPS AS MELANIE AND GEORGIE ARE ABOVE GROUND; URBAN DRONE SOUNDS ABOUND]
MELANIE
I do wonder how healthy it is, going to see him like that.

GEORGIE
I know. But… it helps me. I think.

MELANIE
It certainly sounded pretty nasty.

GEORGIE
Well, it didn’t look too much better.

Uh, there’s a bench here, to your left. Do you mind?

MELANIE
Unoccupied?

GEORGIE
For now. Come on.

MELANIE
Sure.

[CANE TAPPING AS MELANIE LOCATES THE BENCH AND THEY SIT]
GEORGIE
It always tickles me. Coming up here for privacy.

MELANIE
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. Personally, I think a city full of snooping cameras and staring eyes really sets the mood.

GEORGIE
Of course you do.

[FABRIC RUSTLES]
MELANIE
Everything’s a bit… shit. Isn’t it?

GEORGIE
Not everything.

MELANIE
How did he look?

GEORGIE
He’s happy, I think. Does that… Does that make him evil?

MELANIE
It makes him a cat.

GEORGIE
And, I mean, sure it’s not a great look for Battersea, but watching it… It’s just the gorier bits of a nature documentary on repeat.

MELANIE
There’s nothing natural about this though.

GEORGIE
No.

MELANIE
…

We could still pull him out, y’know, like, like the others.

GEORGIE
No. No. It… It hurts to see him like that, but he’s safer there. If we took him, we’d just be putting him in danger. We might even be putting the others in danger from him.

MELANIE
You’re not still going on about that dream of the giant, murderous tunnel-cat are you?

[GEORGIE SNORTS]
You know you’re not actually a prophet, hon?

GEORGIE
Sure… But by this point, it wouldn’t be the most unlikely thing that’s happened to us.

And it’s not like the tunnels have gotten any safer with them hanging around.

MELANIE
It feels crap, you know, just doing nothing.

GEORGIE
We’re surviving. And trying to help others do the same. That’s not nothing.

MELANIE
True.

Even if it feels like it sometimes.

GEORGIE
…

I still care about him, you know. But getting involved will only make things worse.

MELANIE
We’d better still be talking about the Admiral.

GEORGIE
John’s… doing his best.

MELANIE
Yes. Well, his “best” is us hiding from nightmares in a damp tunnel.

GEORGIE
It’s not his fault. It’s not like he wanted it to happen.

MELANIE
I know that, right! I know. I know. But the truth is, I just don’t like him. I never have… and I’m sick of people acting like I should feel so super-sympathetic towards him, just because he’s had a rough time of it. I’ve had a rough time of it from the second I met him! We all have! And he doesn’t –

GEORGIE
Oh, honey. I –

MELANIE
Okay. I can still hate him, even if I don’t, y’know, blame him but…

[MELANIE EXHALES FRUSTRATEDLY]
GEORGIE
You know, you’re actually quite similar.

MELANIE
Well then at least I hate consistently.

GEORGIE
You should really talk to Laverne about that.

MELANIE
Oh trust me, it came up. Day one I think.

[SAD SOUND OF UNDERSTANDING FROM GEORGIE]
But all that said, we should still help them.

GEORGIE
What could we even do for them if John’s some kind of… all-knowing demigod?

MELANIE
Not down there. Martin says they can’t find a way up into the Institute.

GEORGIE
Too risky. I told you about the things down near the stairs, right?

MELANIE
Oh, ah, yeah.

GEORGIE
We can’t afford to attract their attention.

MELANIE
You’re doing it again.

GEORGIE
[Frustrated] Argh.

MELANIE
Look, you-you’ve been doing so much better recently. I, I know it’s really hard to judge risk without a, a sense of fear –

GEORGIE
But I’m still overcompensating.

MELANIE
Well, I mean, not, not necessarily. It is dangerous. But… I, I don’t see another way out of this. An-And I don’t intend to spend the rest of eternity sleeping in a tunnel playing ‘mystery tin’.

GEORGIE
Not even if it was just the two of us?

MELANIE
Oh, okay. Yes, well… maybe I, I could handle that for a bit. But if there’s even a small chance we could put things back…

GEORGIE
You’re right. I know you’re right. I just hate getting involved.

MELANIE
We’ve always been involved, right?

GEORGIE
Yeah.

MELANIE
A-A-At least now it’s on our terms. This way you can get back to podcasting about monsters, rather than hiding from them.

GEORGIE
[Sigh] Urgh, don’t. I was just thinking about that yesterday. How much I legitimately miss those shitty ad reads. You know, everything happened just as I was recording one?

MELANIE
Oh god, yeah! Um, what was it, uh –

GEORGIE
[Podcaster voice] “Slaughterville: The Town of a Thousand Corpses.”

MELANIE
[Happily] Yes! [chuckles]

GEORGIE
Some god-awful true crime thing based in a Colorado town where there were meant to be, like, three serial killers or something.

MELANIE
Jesus.

GEORGIE
I was so proud of the script I did for it as well. Thought I’d really nailed that schlocky pulp vibe without it being super obvious that I was making fun of them.

MELANIE
Maybe you could do a rendition for the others?

GEORGIE
Not sure how well that would sit alongside Arun’s latest hymn.

[EXAGGERATED SOUND OF DESPAIR FROM MELANIE]
MELANIE
Come on, we’d better head back. It’s probably not a great idea leaving that lot with John and Martin unsupervised.

[SOUNDS OF GETTING UP TO LEAVE]
GEORGIE
Yeah.

MELANIE
So… we help them?

GEORGIE
Well, we’re not going up the tower, but… yeah. I want my cat back.

So this is it?

Just up those stairs?

GEORGIE
Just? You’ve seen how tall that tower is, right?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t have much of a choice.

MARTIN
Yeah, but still, it’s just walking, though, isn’t it? And god knows we’ve had enough practice. How come you haven’t had a look yourselves?

GEORGIE
Keep watching.

[MOVEMENT ON GRAVELLY SURFACE]
You see those?

MARTIN
What – Oh. Oh… ah. Are those… corpses?

GEORGIE
I wish. Watch.

GEORGIE
Shh!

[AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THE NOISES SUBSIDE, BUT REMAIN UNCOMFORTABLE BACKGROUND SOUNDS]
MARTIN
Right. So these are the, uh… ‘former archivists’ you were talking about, John?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
I don’t like them.

ARCHIVIST
No.

MARTIN
So what do we do? How do we get past them?

GEORGIE
Dunno. It was never worth risking it.

MARTIN
Wait, seriously? I thought you had this whole ‘invisibility cloak’ thing going on?

GEORGIE
Sure, but I’m not exactly keen to test it against the eyeball tower guardians. I don’t know the limits of our ‘invisibility’, and it seems pretty dumb to saunter up and hope it works on them.

MARTIN
Right.

GEORGIE
Look. I’ve taken you this far. Beyond this point you’re on your own, alright?

MARTIN
No advice at all?

GEORGIE
I… I dunno. Believe in yourself?

MARTIN
Wow. Thanks.

ARCHIVIST
It’s alright, Martin. They’ll let us through.

MARTIN
You’re sure?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
I thought you weren’t so good at knowing down here? What if, what if you’re wrong and then we’re absolu–

ARCHIVIST
I’m not.

Trust me.

Thank you Georgie.

GEORGIE
Sure.

Good luck.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you.

And tell Melanie… Tell her I’m sorry.

GEORGIE
That’s… not what she wants to hear from you.

ARCHIVIST
Well, then… what does she want?

GEORGIE
I don’t know. But… it’s not going to be another apology.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. Tell her I –

GEORGIE
[With a touch of humour] Look. Tell her yourself when you get back down, okay? I’m not your bloody P.A. Anything you’ve got to say to me, that can wait too.

ARCHIVIST
Okay.

Let’s go Martin.

ARCHIVIST
Of course. Sorry, I uh…

It’s fine. Just… this is a lot of steps.

ARCHIVIST
It’s a very tall tower.

ARCHIVIST
Yes, alright.

Not keeping you am I?

ARCHIVIST
S– No, I – it’s just, I, uh…

MARTIN
What, you’re not tired?

ARCHIVIST
Oh no, believe me, I am. It’s just, uh… It’s kind of difficult not to keep climbing.

MARTIN
What, like… you’re being called?

ARCHIVIST
More like pulled. Gently, but very definitely upwards, towards the top.

MARTIN
That could be a bad sign.

ARCHIVIST
Probably. Too late to bail now, though.

MARTIN
True.

You seem less nervous at least?

ARCHIVIST
[Breezily] Oh god, no. I-I’m far more scared than I was down there, but, I-I don’t know, I feel… giddy. Powerful. Coming up from the tunnels into the tower, I-I can See again and… It’s just a bit of a rush, you know?

MARTIN
Sure. Just… just try to keep it together, okay? The last thing we need is you… wigging out.

ARCHIVIST
I’ll do my best.

You ready?

MARTIN
R-Rosie? What, what are you doing here?

ROSIE
[Unrecognising and slightly stilted] Hello, I’m Rosie. Assistant for Mr. Magnus.

Do you have an appointment?

ARCHIVIST
No.

MARTIN (BACKGROUND)
Wh–?

ARCHIVIST
We don’t.

ROSIE
Oh, I see. Uh… well I-I’m very sorry, but I’m afraid he’s booked up for quite some time.

You may need to try again another day.

MARTIN
Rosie, are you alright? It’s, it’s us. It’s, it’s okay, we’re here to help.

[ROSIE BACKS AWAY]
ROSIE
Sir, please calm down.

MARTIN (BACKGROUND)
I’m not –

ROSIE
There’s no need to get worked up, I’m only doing my job.

MARTIN
Rosie, I’m not going to do –

ARCHIVIST
Jonah Magnus will see us. Please inform him we’re here.

ROSIE
I really don’t think that’s a –

I insist.

Excuse me, sir. Two gentlemen here to see you.

ARCHIVIST
The Archivist. And Martin Blackwood.

ROSIE
The Archivist. And, uh… an ‘associate’.

MARTIN
Ouch.

Yes I –

Yes, I-I understand, I jus–

I – Sorry to interrupt.

[INTERCOM CLICKS OFF, SWIRLING STATIC FADES]
[Firm, but with a slight tremor] Like I said, unless you have an appointment there’s nothing I can do.

ARCHIVIST
I understand.

ROSIE
Now, I’m sorry, but if there’s nothing else, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. I’m very busy.

ARCHIVIST
Of course.

[FOOTSTEPS AS THEY WALK AWAY, TO SPEAK ASIDE]
MARTIN
What’s she doing here?

ARCHIVIST
She’s his assistant. So The Eye put her here.

MARTIN
Did she… choose it?

ARCHIVIST
Did any of us?

MARTIN
So, what? She’s just gone? She doesn’t remember us at all?

ARCHIVIST
To a degree, but –

[DISCOMFITED NOISE FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
MARTIN
Are you alri– Oh.

ARCHIVIST
I-I’m sorry.

MARTIN
Oh Christ, go on…

[STATIC RISES]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
[PAPER RUSTLES AND A CLOCK TICKS… TOCKS… TICKS…]
“Nosy Rosie”, he had said. The words had been soft, hidden behind the CV he was examining, but she heard them clear as day.

“What did you say?” She tried to hide the hurt and disbelief, the sudden impact of a childhood nickname she thought she had long since left behind.

“Sorry?” His voice was light. “I don’t think I said anything.”

There was a long moment as Rosie stared at her interviewer. His expression was a pure, friendly, confusion, a light sort of innocence that gave nothing away. But she had definitely heard it. Was he just going to pretend it hadn’t happened?

Apparently so.

She studied the face of ‘Elias Bouchard’. He seemed far too young for the role he had apparently found himself in, with an old-fashioned haircut that seemed to accentuate the image rather than lessen it. How was he already the head of an academic institution? No doubt mummy and daddy had something to do with it… The thought leapt across Rosie’s mind before she could stop it, and with no small amount of bitterness.

His eyes, though, were different. There was something in them that unsettled her. They didn’t match the rest of his face. They were cold and grey, and somehow so much older.

“So why do you want this job, Ms. Zampano?”

‘Because I need money to live, you pompous ass,’ she didn’t answer. ‘Because I let my imagination and paranoia wreck my marriage, and now I’ve got nothing. And if I don’t get a job, I’m just sitting around an empty flat staring into space.’ Instead she smiled.

“I guess I’m just curious to know what goes on in a place like this.”

[OFFICE SOUNDS CEASE; DOOR CREAKS, FAINT SOUNDS OF SCREAMING IN BACKGROUND]
From up here she can see all of it at such a distance. She can hear the distant screams, spot the occasional gout of blood, smell the burning flesh wafting from far below when the wind is right. Should she be doing something? Her hand hovers over the intercom. Mr. Bouchard isn’t to be disturbed; Rosie is certain of that, but what else could she do? She chokes down her unease and smiles again, just in case anyone might be watching.

[SCREAMING CEASES; DOOR CREAKS, ADMITTING SOFT FOOTSTEPS]
They weren’t actually Cockney, she knew that for certain. They might as well have been asking to take that table up the ‘apples and pears’. Some kind of practical joke being played on her? She said nothing, though she glanced around in case anyone was watching from a distance, snickering. The pair of them loomed over her with identical expressions on their identical faces. Expressions of gruff impatience.

Rosie looked over the delivery form.

[PAPER RUSTLES]
‘Jonathan Sims’, the name read. She knew him. Well, knew of him, the things they said about him in the break room, the sort of things that passed across Mr. Bouchard’s desk about him. She hadn’t been snooping, exactly, but maybe a little bit curious. Rosie had liked Gertrude, Sims’ predecessor. The old woman had always talked to her as though she was in on something, even though Rosie had never understood half the things she had told her. Sims was different. He was insecure, aggressive, desperate to be taken seriously. Of course, having seen his file, Rosie kind of understood. Why on earth Mr. Bouchard had given him the job at all was a mystery to her, but it didn’t make it any easier to talk to him.

He was *in the building, and she really should have called down, gotten him to come up and sign off on the delivery. But if he dragged his feet, that would have left *her here with these two weird impressionists. And no doubt when he finally did arrive there’d be some drama or other. No, she’d just sign for it, and pass it on to Martin. He’d get it sorted out.

Besides, she was kind of curious to see what was in the package.

[PAPERS MOVE, FOOTSTEPS AND DOOR CREAKS; FAINT SCREAMING RESUMES]
It is him behind it all. She’s certain. The words and noises that sometimes leak out of Mr. Bouchard’s office are enough to convince her of that. Should she still call him Mr. Bouchard, knowing what she knows now about what it is that lives inside him, through him? She doesn’t really need to call him anything, of course. He hasn’t spoken to her since she clocked into the building. And there haven’t been any visitors. She still smiles, though. Just in case.

[SCREAMING CEASES; DOOR CREAKS, FAINT SOUND OF FIRE ALARM AND AGITATED PEOPLE, KNOCKS ON DOOR]
He didn’t even look up from his desk.

“Everyone else is evacuating,” she yelled over the din of the fire alarm. Mr. Bouchard just smiled.

“I wouldn’t worry about it, Rosie.” He shuffled his papers. “Just a little incident down in the Archives. It’ll be dealt with soon enough.”

Something was wrong. He hadn’t had any calls. No-one had come by. There was no way for him to know what was going on. But he said it with such confidence. She turned and slowly walked back to her desk.

[FOOTSTEPS AND PAPER RUSTLING]
Something was going on, and Rosie wasn’t going anywhere until she knew what it was.

[RUNNING FOOTSTEPS]
When Sasha James barrelled past her without even glancing in her direction, Rosie knew she’d been right to wait.

[FAINT SOUND OF ELIAS AND SASHA TALKING]
She moved quickly to the door, listening, looking around the edge. What were they talking about? Worms? Like that weird infestation they had down there? How is that an emergency?

Behind his desk, without missing a beat of his conversation, Elias caught her eye, and suddenly she was a child again, creeping towards the rotten board in her parents’ attic, burning to know what lurked behind it, [FLOORBOARD CREAKS WARNINGLY] unsuspecting of the squirming nest of half-dead insect bodies she was about to reveal.

[INSECTILE AND SQUIRMING NOISES]
Then she was back in the office. Mr. Bouchard was still smiling. And Rosie turned to run.

[RUNNING FOOTSTEPS; DOOR CREAKS AND FAINT SCREAMING RESUMES]
Maybe she could help, stuck here at the top of the impossible tower. She could just buzz him, ask him what was going on, tell him to stop.

Her finger hovered over the button. Her hand was shaking. What if he got angry? She couldn’t afford to lose this job. She couldn’t. Rosie put her hand down and started smiling again. She was getting very good at it by now.

[SCREAMING CEASES; DOOR CREAKS]
She had waited for the gunshot. Her whole body felt like it was made of glass, locked in place but ready to shatter at any moment. Mr. Bouchard had told her explicitly, ‘Do not phone the police.’ But that woman, she’d been dressed as police. And she had a gun. A-and Sims, she’d been practically dragging him. What was Rosie supposed to do, except wait for a gunshot that never came.

Then the others arrived; Tim and that new girl.

[FOOTSTEPS AS THEY ENTER THE OFFICE; FAINT SOUNDS OF TALKING]
She wanted to warn them, to tell them something was wrong, but… what if it made Mr. Bouchard angry? Why did the thought of that terrify her so? He was just a man, and he’d never been anything but cordial to her. Did she need this job that badly?

At the back of her mind, her curiosity urged her to get closer, to try and hear what was being said. But this time fear locked her into her seat. When the other police did come, and Mr. Bouchard’s voice came through the intercom, so light, so in control, she sent them away, and watched as the others filed out of his office so slowly, so defeated…

[FAINT VOICES STOP; FOOTSTEPS FILE OUT]
That was when she no longer suspected. She knew. Finally her paranoia had not been for nothing. She was working for evil. Not someone misguided, not selfish, but truly evil. And she knew she was going to sit there and ignore that fact. She knew the sort of information he had on everyone, and now she knew what he was capable of, what he might do if he thought Rosie might be a threat. She was just going to sit there, watch, and hope to go unnoticed. And a small part of her, almost wanted to see what was going to happen.

[DOOR CREAKS AND FAINT SCREAMING RESUMES]
Why doesn’t she do it? She knows he’s in there, she can hear him occasionally. And he likes her, Rosie’s pretty sure of that. She is perhaps the only person on Earth in a position to help, to at least ask what is happening, to ask why. But now all she can do is sit there and smile, waiting for the intercom.

[SCREAMING CEASES; DOOR CREAKS, FAINT BUZZ OF VOICES OVER A POLICE RADIO AND FOOTSTEPS]
There should have been relief, when they led him out in handcuffs. A weight removed, a tightness loosed from her chest. But there wasn’t. Mr. Bouchard had smiled at her as the inspector marched him out. He wasn’t even surprised. She hadn’t smiled back. She hadn’t smiled in a long time, except for that painful customer service grin she had forced onto her face when Mr. Bouchard had visitors. Visitors like…

[RISE AND FADE OF LONELY STATIC]
Of course. The floating unease settled into shape as soon as she saw Mr. Lukas. Rosie knew what he was going to say before he even opened his mouth.

“Rosie, right? I’m Peter Lukas. Elias asked me to look after the Institute while he was away. So, I guess that makes you my assistant. Right?”

She knew all about Peter Lukas, of course. Bouchard had always been very careful to leave his files in conspicuous enough locations for her. She knew he’d been preparing her. She didn’t want to let him down. Or did she? Rosie didn’t even know anymore. At the very least, he’d never lied to her, never failed to validate her suspicions or indulge her snooping. As afraid as she was, he seemed to understand her. And as much as she disliked this temporary replacement, she knew she was going to stay.

[DOOR CREAKS AND FAINT SCREAMING RESUMES]
People have come to see Elias. No. Not people. Not anymore. They stare through her, and she knows that she was never going to help. She smiles at them, and politely informs them that Mr. Bouchard isn’t seeing anyone without an appointment. Her face aches, and her teeth buzz in her gums.

[SCREAMING CEASES; DOOR CREAKS, FOLLOWED BY FOOTSTEPS]
Where else could she have gone? Mr. Lukas was dead. Mr. Bouchard was missing. So many friends and colleagues dead. The violence, the gunshots. The old man and his… daughter? Their murderous joy. She couldn’t stop thinking about their faces. How they had looked right past her as they ran through the building.

Over now, of course. Weeks ago. Too early to forget but too late to act. Wasn’t that always the way? Her flat was empty and silent. All her friends and family now so distant as to be almost strangers. What else could she have done except come in to work? She didn’t know who for or why. She had simply sat at her desk and waited for the phone to ring. She waited and she waited.

[CHAIR CREAKS]
And it got dark. And it got light. Over and over, and still she waited. All she knew was that something still needed to happen. And she couldn’t bring herself to leave until she knew what it was.

[BUILDING STARTS TO CREAK, GROWING LOUDER AS IT WARPS]
[SOUNDS OF ALARUM AND BELLS]
Not until the sky began to change, and the screaming began. And Mr. Bouchard returned to his office.

[SOUND OF BUILDINGS CRUMBLING AND FLAMES RISING IN THE DISTANCE]
By then it was too late. In many ways it felt like it had always been too late.

[STATIC RISES]
ARCHIVIST
S-Sorry.

[FOOTSTEPS AS ROSIE APPROACHES]
MARTIN
[Softly] Oh Rosie…

ROSIE
Mr. Sims, was it?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, yes?

ROSIE
I believe you have an appointment. Mr. Magnus is waiting just inside.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Right.

[FOOTSTEPS]
MARTIN
Is there anything we can do to help her?

ARCHIVIST
If there is, it’s on the other side of these doors.

ROSIE
Head right on in, he’s ready for you.

MARTIN
Okay.

[DOOR OPENS, LETTING A WASH OF STATIC AND DISTORTED SPEECH FLOW OUT]
[NOTE: ELIAS’ SPEECH UNDERSCORES THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION, AN UNBREAKING NARRATIVE OF FEAR AS HE FLOATS AND WRITHES IN PERPETUAL PERCEPTION]
JONAH (BACKGROUND)
– he screams his pitch is low and black as night that flows and chokes his withered throat and hacking cough that sounds like death is here for him who always knew and feared that this indecent end would carve its bitter name full deep inside his soul and burn within without a ceasing seeing moment more than screaming ones who howl and hide from fates that crawl towards on nails that scratch and creak like rotten boards might warn you of your severed pains approach to pull your skin like sodden cloth and drag it tearing from the now that is no longer even close to what the when just might have been if there was time enough to run and hide from rancid deaths –

ARCHIVIST
[Aghast] No…

MARTIN
Can he hear us?

ARCHIVIST
I…

MARTIN
Does he even know we’re here?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t…

MARTIN
[Calling] Elias!

Jonah, Jonah Magnus!

Oi! Dickhead! Come down here so we can kick your arse!

ARCHIVIST
[Sadly] He can’t hear you, Martin.

MARTIN
Yeah I got that. What’s wrong with him?

ARCHIVIST
Nothing. Nothing’s wrong with him.

He’s the pupil of The Eye.

MARTIN
Meaning?

ARCHIVIST
He won.

JONAH/ELIAS (BACKGROUND)
– that stinks of hate and wafts to him with promise of the fast approaching corpse that bears his face and holds within its chest the promise of his own annihilation carved in gouges deep and ragged cutting clean through bone that cracked to splintered powder cast of empty blackened earth that is his home again but something’s wrong with what he see upon the door is written not his name but words that mean no more to him than jumbled symbols twisting in the edges of his sight that tries to focus on the emptiness around him but the mist that curls its bitter weeping ache around his legs that bristle up with shivered gooseflesh stained with red that’s not his blood whose blood he bled but this is not from him and yet he knows he loved this blood when once it beat within a heart that joined to his through choice or circumstance but now it stains his weeping edges scarlet gloating now of all the butchered ugly fates that might already have befallen what you still might boast he loves at hands that might be moved by others or that might just now be his what have you done what have you done what have you done what have you done why do you hear upon the gloating wind the screaming of his name as now he begs him please to stop the razor slicing through that flesh but there is nothing he can do from here upon the threshold to a house she almost knows to be a home but empty hollow and devoid of all the trappings that could once have given comfort to the pale and weeping shadow of her life that has been left devoid and faded at the corners like a photograph whose sepia-tinted warmth has drained to just a crowd of faceless staring strangers among whom once she stood to feel safe as houses no-one dares to enter anymore in case they trip upon the mouldy corpse of memories that once gave hope and now provide her nothing but a smile upon the face of something grinning at her sharply and with teeth like rows of hungry needles desperate still to stick through skin like cloth into a tapestry of suffering that billows in the wind and gusts like sails upon a wide and pitch black sea with no horizon in the distance calling one and all towards it with a pull that makes her stomach drop to know she can’t resist the waves that lap and drag her over and across the surface still as cracked obsidian but deeper that the world could ever dream as something wakes and shifts below they grab the wheel and cry in panic at their howling crew to ready for a harrowed doomed escape from what begins to rise below them–

[FOOTSTEPS AS THE ARCHIVIST AND MARTIN PACE AROUND LOOKING UP AT THE FLOATING FEAR CONDUIT THAT IS JONAH MAGNUS, CHANTING AND CHANNELLING IT TO THE UNFATHOMABLE EYE THAT STARES DOWN FROM ABOVE]
MARTIN
What do you mean he’s won?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, he’s done it. He’s… ascended, become a part of The Eye. He’s… he’s beyond us.

MARTIN
[To Jonah] Just shut up! Christ!

ARCHIVIST
He can’t hear you.

MARTIN
So, so what? He’s not aware of us? Of, of any of this?

ARCHIVIST
No. Or if he is, it’s only as a miniscule speck amongst the flood of knowledge and fear that’s passing through him. He is become the conduit between this new world and the thing that watches it. It’s all running through him.

MARTIN
Sounds awful.

ARCHIVIST
To someone so close to it, I imagine it would be a state of… agonised bliss.

I can feel it… the… completeness of it all passing out from him. I can see everything from here, and that’s still just a hint of what he must be feeling –

MARTIN
[Warning] John…

ARCHIVIST
– as he watches a man run screaming down endless dark alleys that close and crush and press –

[RUMBLING SOUNDS START TO RISE]
MARTIN
[Hard warning] John…

Stay with me.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry. I-It’s a, it’s a lot.

MARTIN
I, I can see that, but you need to keep it together.

ARCHIVIST
S-Sorry, I think… I can handle it.

MARTIN
Right, so what’s the play?

ARCHIVIST
…

I-I’m not sure.

MARTIN
Well… we came here to confront Elias – Jonah – whatever! So, how do we do that?

ARCHIVIST
He’s too far gone. He’s barely even aware we exist.

MARTIN
And I’m guessing you can’t just destroy him like the others?

ARCHIVIST
No. God knows what would happen if I called upon The Eye to try and destroy a vital piece of itself. Best case scenario, nothing happens.

MARTIN
And worst case?

ARCHIVIST
No idea. An enormous explosion that destroys the world? We get torn apart, but still suffering or, or cast off to the edges of the fearscape, maybe? I, I don’t know.

MARTIN
Okay. So not that then. But… what about something, like, physical?

ARCHIVIST
I – What?

MARTIN
Look, I know it’s all about dream logic and metaphor and all that… stuff, but, y’know, what if we just… what if we just grabbed him and, y’know, pulled him down? Or just threw something heavy at him?

ARCHIVIST
Uh… I, I don’t…

MARTIN
Or, or, or, what about, um… That’s Elias’ body, right? I mean, yeah, they’re obviously Magnus’ eyes, but that’s still a Bouchard body up there so… so maybe Magnus’ original body is just still lying around here somewhere? That, that was a weakness before the transformation, so… maybe we could still use that?

ARCHIVIST
It’s gone. Ashes swept away by the winds of ecstatic terror. What you see up there is all that remains.

MARTIN
Right.

[softly] Right, right, right.

…

Is the original Elias still in there somewhere?

ARCHIVIST
He’s, uh –

MARTIN
Maybe we could get through to him somehow?

ARCHIVIST
Ah, no, it isn’t that – Ahh…

[CEASELESS CHANTING CEASES]
[BACKGROUND STATIC LIKE RUSTLING PAPER ECHOES THROUGH THE CHAMBER]
[STATEMENT STATIC RISES]
MARTIN
Again? But you just did one for Ro–

[Realisation] Oh no…

[PANOPTICON SOUNDS FADE TO A TICKING CLOCK AND THE OCCASIONAL RUSTLE OF PAPER]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
He recognises those eyes. He’s seen them all his life, watching him, judging him, cutting through him so no part of him was secret or safe. They peel away the armour, his carefree smile and practiced shrugs. They are the eyes of his father, and they stare at Elias over an old mahogany desk, sat in the face of a man who said his name was James Wright. His interviewer smiles with his mouth, but the eyes are the same.

[JONAH/ELIAS IS A DARK, STATIC-VOICED ENTITY – EACH LINE A CRACKLING MIX OF DEEP INTONATIONS YET STILL CHARACTERISTICALLY ELIAS]
JONAH/ELIAS
So tell me, Elias. What are you afraid of?

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Elias Bouchard freezes in place. The question catches him completely off-guard. Why would he ask him something like that? Elias is applying for a research job – what the hell does that matter?

“Why, uh… Why do you ask?” He gets the words out through a throat that doesn’t want to speak.

JONAH/ELIAS
In the Institute we are keenly interested in the anatomy of fear. Much that is stored here is disquieting. It is important to know if anything here might… upset you.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
His mind races. He can’t tell the truth, obviously. Elias can’t look this man in the face, and tell him that he is what scares him. That his eyes, the curiosity and judgement that pulses out of them, they terrify him in a way he can’t put into words. He feels that prickly panic building in the back of his skull, that worry that spills through: he knows. He knows I’m high. The thought leaps to Elias’ mind for only a second before he remembers that he’s not. He hasn’t lit up all day, of course not, he’s got an interview. But even so, he can’t shake the familiar paranoia. He looks again at his would-be employer, who seems like he’s about to repeat the question.

“Spiders,” Elias says quickly. “I’m afraid of spiders.”

James Wright nods, the smile curling into one of satisfaction, though Elias is sure the man doesn’t believe him. Those eyes break contact for a moment, flicking up to the corner of the office where, at the edge of a bookshelf that sags with age and weight, a small cobweb has started to form.

JONAH/ELIAS
Very wise. A very sensible fear.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
It is. Yeah, it is. But is it true? For a moment, Elias really can’t remember. Right here and now, the thought of a spider genuinely repulses him. The image of a scuttling, filthy creature, eight eyes glinting out in the darkness, crawls into his mind, and he shudders, looking away for a second. But the uninvited thought keeps going. He imagines the spider moving up his leg, his body, he imagines feeling its bristling hairs against the skin of his shoulder, his throat, his cheek. It’s spindly probing legs finding their way up his face. Elias can’t stop himself picturing that spider sat there, venom dripping from fangs that hang, poised over his eye. He can’t shut his eye.

A cough from over the desk breaks his train of thought. His interviewer is staring at him, and all at once he’s back with himself, burning with embarrassment. Those eyes stare, impassive and stern as ever, but… is that a twinkle of satisfaction? As though he has been given him an answer he likes. The next question comes slowly, and Elias tries to squash down the fear growing in his chest.

JONAH/ELIAS
So tell me. Have you ever had an experience that you would consider supernatural?

[MEMORY BRINGS UP THE BUZZING OF FLIES]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
And immediately Elias is in that room again, fumbling for the light switch, smelling the coppery scent of old blood mixed with the crusty odour of a room that has been hot-boxed a bit too often. The memory is as fresh and vivid as the day it happened. He knows that Allan is dead, but he needs the light to be sure, to see it for himself. He finds it, and the switch feels slippery beneath his fingers.

[SWITCH IS CLICKED, AND THERE IS THE SOUND OF DISGUST AND RETCHING]
When the light comes on. Elias has no idea how much of the crimson that bathes the scene is from the blood on the walls, how much from the blood that tints the lightbulb, and how much is simply the shading of his memory. But he remembers so clearly what he was thinking as he looked at the what was left of Allan Schrieber: where are his eyes? What did they do with his eyes?

“No…,” Elias tries to say, though his mouth is dry and his head is swimming. “No, I don’t, uh, I don’t think…”

James Wright says nothing as another memory bubbles up from inside Elias, like the last scream of a drowning diver.

[SOUND OF PAPER, PAGES TURNING IN A BOOK]
Allan is in the library, irritated at the interruption, but happy to see a friendly face. The whites of his eyes are riddled with the crimson veins of sleeplessness, but his hand trembles with a feverish energy as he tries to explain the significance of the book he’s found. Even sober, Elias couldn’t have followed what his friend was saying, lost in layers of theological scholarship, but he smiles anyway to see the reserved young Allan so passionate about his subject.

He looks at the book itself. It’s old, crumbling, with none of the usual college library markings. He asks Allan where he got it, and his friend doesn’t answer, instead glancing around with a sudden self-conscious suspicion. Elias shuffles round to get a closer look at the pages, then stops in confusion, as he realises that they are all blank. Allan only laughs when he says so. Was the laughter really that cruel? Or is it just the warping of memory, the past he tries to forget, mixed with the nightmares that came after, the faces he dreamed of seeing in those pages.

“Well, er…” Elias is shaking all over. “That is to say…”

Another one. Allan is curled up behind the sofa in the living room they share. Elias stares at his weeping friend, bleary-eyed, trying to follow his housemate’s strange monologue, half-confession, half-conspiracy theory, half-urban legend. “It saw me,” Allan keeps saying, over and over again, “It saw me through the pages. And it’s coming.” He sees it, he says, in every mirror, every distant doorway, a silhouette on every skyline. Coming closer each and every time, finding its way towards him, step by step. “It has no eyes,” Allan sobs, “so it has to feel its way towards me. But it knows. It knows!” Elias has no way to comfort him. He can’t even understand what he’s talking about. And so on that, the last night of Allan Schreiber’s life, he just gets him high, and leaves him to sleep it off..

“I… don’t know,” Elias says at last. “You can never really be sure, can you?”

Beyond that stretch of polished mahogany, so well waxed that his pale, sweating face is clearly visible, James Wright’s smile remains unchanged.

JONAH/ELIAS
Who indeed? Now tell me: why do you want this job?

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Elias tries not to visibly sigh with relief. This, at least, is a question to which he has prepared an answer. He clears his throat slightly, shaking off the lingering image of Allan’s body.

‘Well,’ he begins, ‘I’ve always had the greatest respect for the work put out by this institute on mythological traditions, especially some of the recent papers on Indo-European traditions which was very useful for my dissertation on –’

He stops. Those eyes. They know. They can see right through all his bullshit, right to the core of him. They know what he really thinks. A position in a small, obscure little academic organisation, the first step on a path to the position he actually deserved. This place could be anything, as far as he is concerned. Medical research, a grant foundation… it doesn’t really matter. So why choose the Magnus Institute? Barely known outside its own little sphere of influence, hardly respected among the wider academic community.

[PIANO MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND]
His father’s words came to him again, as they always had, through childhood, boarding school, university. “You’re a smart boy, Elias, but you’re lazy. You have every advantage that I and this world could possibly provide, and yet you insist on squandering them. Don’t think I don’t see you, looking at those other children with envy, as though their meaningless little lives could contain anything of substance, anything for a Bouchard to aspire to. You are better than them, and they know it. And it is your job to prove worthy of that distinction.”

Elias’ stomach tightened at the memory, the fierce judgement in his father’s eyes. Even laid out in a casket, it was as if he had looked at Elias with disdain. What should he say? That he had no idea why he wanted this job? That he was all alone in the world, no friends, no family, nothing but the deep certainty that he deserved better. That he was destined to be important. That it was in his blood.

Where had he heard about this job opening? Had it been in a newspaper? He knew no-one who worked here, but received a letter anyway inviting him to interview. Now that he thought about it, he hadn’t even sent out a CV. Yet somehow he found himself sat across from this man whose smile hadn’t moved the whole time, and whose eyes seemed to know why he was here far better than he did.

“I, uh,” Elias’ voice wavered, paused. “I’ve always had the greatest respect for the work put out by this institute on mythological traditions, especially some of the recent papers on Indo-European traditions which was very –”

JONAH/ELIAS
Enough. Tell me, why are you here?

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I… I don’t know.

JONAH/ELIAS
Were you drawn here?

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Yes. I was.

JONAH/ELIAS
Against your will?

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
No.

JONAH/ELIAS
Then why did you heed the call?

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Because… this is the place I know I should be.

JONAH/ELIAS
Good.

The job is yours.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
[STRANGE STATIC RISES. A FAINT REPEATING RUMBLING SOUND STARTS UP]
Elias has the briefest of flashes, a sudden burst of terror, an image of himself, strapped down, helpless. The vanishing of well-known faces, and the harsh sneers that replace them as they stare at him. He cannot move. He cannot scream. What is happening? What is that he feels deep down his skull? What are they doing to his eyes? The presence, old and rotten, in his mind?

He can do nothing but watch.

[SOUNDS FADE]
The moment passes, and Elias returns to himself. He tries to smile, and thanks his new employer for the opportunity.

[STATEMENT STATIC RISES, THEN FADES AWAY INTO THE SOUNDS OF THE PANOPTICON]

You alright? That was… intense.

[JONAH/ELIAS’ CHANTING NARRATIVE UNCEASES]

…as they look down to see the pitch black void of ocean getting darker still as something rises up that dwarfs the sky and yet they know it is the smallest tip of only one appendage reaching up splitting timber splitting steel splitting friends all into shapes and forms and spatters that don’t register as human even as the inky frozen sea pulls air out of their lungs because it is so cold it is so cold it is so coldly sneering as sticky strands pull taut against the flailing struggles as they try to pull away from what approaches in the distant edge of this colossal latticework of bone and sickly paste that twists and curls with each vibration of those fools like them now caught and wrapped and flailing in their heaving desperation not to see it looming over them with glassy eyes and fangs that drip with poison and the promise of the slow and steady agony of feeling all that was herself dissolved and broken down into the bitter pleading –

ARCHIVIST
Yeah… uhh… I just… uhh…

MARTIN
Was that… the real Elias? Is he still in there then?

ARCHIVIST
No… No. It was… an echo. The last spasm of a corpse. It-It’s far too late for either of them.

MARTIN
Damn.

ARCHIVIST
There was never anything we could have done. But I-I saw…

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
You were right.

MARTIN
About what?

ARCHIVIST
His body is vulnerable. At least to me.

MARTIN
…

What’s the catch?

ARCHIVIST
I could kill his body, sever the link, break The Eye’s power, and Jonah Magnus would die.

MARTIN
Okay, that sounds good but…?

ARCHIVIST
But, that wouldn’t actually harm The Eye itself. And with him gone it would… it would choose a suitable replacement.

MARTIN
Oh.

ARCHIVIST
If we kill Jonah Magnus, I take his place.

MARTIN
Oh god.

ARCHIVIST
And I think…

…that’s exactly what it wants.

ARCHIVIST
Yes! N-no! I don’t know, just somewhere! Anywhere, without that… thing droning horrors, and Rosie staring at us like we’re going to bite her. I just – I need to think.

MARTIN
Alright.

Alright, we’ll, we’ll go back to the tunnels, regroup, figure out what our next move is. See what other options there are.

ARCHIVIST
…

Yeah.

MARTIN
John?

…

[Warning] John?

ARCHIVIST
I just need a moment. To… to properly consider things.

MARTIN
“Consider” what exactly?

[SILENCE SAVE FOR THE TOWER NOISES]
ARCHIVIST
[Quietly] It might be our only option.

MARTIN
[Vehemently] What are you talking about?! H-How is it an “option”? Okay, setting aside the fact that it’s a suicidal idea, it’s just completely stupid! What actual good would it do? Right now, as far as I can see, we’d just be swapping one self-important, floating, hollowed-out terror zombie for another!

ARCHIVIST
It’s not like that.

MARTIN
Really? Then please enlighten me. Go on, I’m all ears!

ARCHIVIST
Right. When I said that I would ‘replace’ Jonah in there, that’s not –

That place, the centre of The Eye, i-it’s… It wasn’t made for him. That’s why he’s like that, it’s too much, it’s overwhelmed him, his whole being, just destroyed.

MARTIN
Oh yeah? But let me guess, it was made for you?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
[Petulantly] Of course it is. Of course it is! Because how could this journey possibly end with anything less than the final, supreme destiny of the Archivist, plugged into the great fear machine for all eternity and, and abandoning humanity.

Breaking his promise.

ARCHIVIST
That’s not fair!

MARTIN
Isn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Would you just listen? Please?

…

I think… I think that I-I could control it, to, to a certain degree. I could… channel the energies, remake things. Like I’ve been doing on our journey, but, but on a grand scale.

MARTIN
And how’s that going to help? You’ve always said you can’t make less fear in the world. You’d, you’d just be moving it around.

ARCHIVIST
But that might still help. I-I could… rebalance things. Destroy the avatars, make it so that the people suffering most were the ones who, who deserved it.

MARTIN
And what? Replace them with new avatars from the people who don’t want to?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, that has to be better than those that chose it right? Sure I can’t make it “go away”, but I could at least make it fairer. The Eye doesn’t care, as long as it gets its fear, it’s happy either way.

[MARTIN SCOFFS AT THIS JUSTIFICATION]
MARTIN
[Incredulous] Christ, can you hear yourself? “Make it fairer!” It’s not enough that you’re the ‘all-powerful Archivist’, you also have to appoint yourself the literal judge of everyone as well?

ARCHIVIST
Don’t.

MARTIN
I know what it’s like to be powerless. A-And I know you do too. And I also know what it’s like when you get a taste of– wh-when you’re finally able to–

ARCHIVIST
That’s not what this is!

MARTIN
I’ve been out there with you. I saw the kick you got out of making them scream for once.

ARCHIVIST
What happened to “Kill Bill”?

MARTIN
You weren’t meant to enjoy it this much!

ARCHIVIST
Why won’t you believe me when I say that this isn’t something I want to do?

MARTIN
Because I saw your face when we walked into that room!

[Despondent] That wasn’t fear, it, it wasn’t even anger. It was envy.

And it scared me more than anything else I’ve seen.

ARCHIVIST
…

Martin…

MARTIN
We’re here to stop this. Not, not take it over.

ARCHIVIST
What other choice do we have?

MARTIN
I-I don’t know, alright! I do– But there is one.

Because there has to be.

ARCHIVIST
But what if there isn’t? How long are we going to wander around hopelessly searching before we end up back here anyway?

MARTIN
You were the one that wanted to take some time to think things over.

ARCHIVIST
We can’t just dismiss this. It might be our only option.

MARTIN
…

No.

No. I forbid it.

ARCHIVIST
[Incredulous] You forbid it?

MARTIN
Don’t laugh at me.

ARCHIVIST
Why not? You’re being ridiculous.

MARTIN
I refuse to accept that this –

Tough! The world doesn’t care what you accept. It just… is!

It just is.

[DRONES FADE AS STATEMENT STATIC RISES]
[CLINK OF SPOON WHILE STIRRING, THEN PUT DOWN, FOLLOWED BY DRINKING SOUNDS]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
The old man was dead. The old man was dead, and Malcolm could feel nothing but ice-cold relief washing over him. Every step he took seemed lighter.

[FOOTSTEPS]
Every breath seemed cleaner, as though he were walking through a bracing autumn evening. He knew he should be devastated, should be shattered by the loss of what had been the one constant in his life for as long as he could remember, but when his eyes passed over the stained and sagging armchair where the old man had sat, unmoving, for the last decade, the absence of that angular, judging face brought a smile to his lips. A smile of freedom.

At last he could do what he liked. No prying questions when he walked in the door. No more knowing sneers, demanding to be told where he had been. No more tiptoeing around his home in a desperate, futile attempt to avoid the sight of someone who, despite never seeming to move from that spot, seemed all too aware of Malcolm’s every private thought, his every dark impulse.

What was the old man’s name again? Malcolm could barely recall. It didn’t matter, though, no more than it mattered whether he had been a father, grandfather, elderly friend, or even some sort of landlord. What mattered was that for as long as he could remember – how long was that? – the old man had sat on his threadbare throne, and held court over Malcolm’s life. And now he was dead. The morticians had taken the body away – or at least, someone had – and he had been the only one at the sad, overcast funeral. Now he was free to live his life.

To live his life. What did that even mean anymore? What was there for him that wasn’t simply avoiding the cruel barbs and snide judgements of the old man? Perhaps… love? Yes, perhaps now, without the wrinkled threat that chuckled from his armchair at any thought of his happiness, perhaps now he could find someone to spend his life with.

[COMPUTER NOISES]
Malcolm fired up his old computer, which groaned to life with a sputter, the monitor cracked and broken, and the keyboard stiff to the touch. For a terrifying moment it seemed as though it might not work at all, but finally the screen lit up in a dull, sickly green. Malcolm clicked through until he found what he was looking for. A dating site.

The name of the website was distorted beyond recognition, but he seemed to still be logged in from all those years ago, and he began to click through profiles. Mary, she seemed nice, but somehow too long. Jenny seemed to have a good sense of humour, but… half of her was backwards. Hannah didn’t seem to have anything wrong with her at first glance, but her profile smelt of rotten meat. Then he found Antonia, and he gasped. Her smile was so wide and so open that all at once he felt a wave of warm infatuation pass down and over his body, permeating everywhere… Except for his right shoulder, which remained ice cold.

Something was wrong. Malcolm moved his fingers across and over the area, feeling the space between his neck and arm. There was a lump there. Hard and round and smooth to the touch. He pressed it gently, and winced as pain radiated through him. Gingerly, he unbuttoned his shirt, sliding the rough fabric down his torso, and examined the shining protrusion. Some sort of callous? A tumour? Malcolm’s mind began running frantically through all the worst-case possibilities. And then…

[FLESHY SOUND OF OPENING]
The iris was dull grey, surrounded by yellowed, bloodshot tissue, and the pupil was dull, almost cloudy, but the eye staring out from his shoulder seemed to focus well enough.

[WATERY SOUNDS OF VITREOUS SANS HUMOUR]
It swivelled wildly, looking all around the room as Malcolm desperately tried to hold back a scream. Then it settled on the dull glow of the computer monitor. On Antonia. And the icy shock of bitter disapproval shot through his veins like lightning. His hand lunged out almost on reflex, snatching the power cable from the computer and pulling it free. The screen went dark with a small pop, and Malcolm was left sitting there, shaking. The eye turned once towards his pale and terrified face, then closed in satisfaction.

[FOOTSTEPS]
The waiting room was almost empty when he got to Accident & Emergency. The nurse sat at the desk gave him a weird look and told him to take a seat. He tried to settle down on one of the smooth, orange chairs, bolted to a long iron bar to form a crude bench, but he couldn’t get comfortable. From underneath his coat, he could hear it; the tiny, whispering mouth that had opened up on the long Tube-ride over.

“They’re to laugh at you,” it hissed.

“No, they won’t.”

“They’re going to tell you that you’re a freak, a deviant. They’re going to put you away.”

“They’re going to cut you out of me.”

“So you can kill me again?”

“I didn’t kill you.”

“You might as well have. With your insolence. With your disrespect.”

“Shut up!”

“I’ll tell them. I’ll tell all about the horrible thoughts you keep deep inside.”

Malcolm’s leg wouldn’t stop shaking. Somewhere, from deeper within the hospital, a laugh echoed, cold and tinged with a judgemental cruelty that he recognised so keenly. He pulled his coat tighter and got up, stepping out through the automatic doors and into the cold night.

He was going to have to do it himself. That’s all there was to it. If a professional, medical option wasn’t on the cards then what other choice did he have?

[AUTOMATIC DOORS SLIDE OPEN, FOLLOWED BY SUPERMARKET SOUNDS]
He hurried into the supermarket, the dull throb of his shoulder causing his right arm to hang stiffly by his side. There were no trolleys left, nor any baskets, so he grabbed what he could, and held them to his chest, dreading the possibility they all might fall tumbling to the ground at any moment. Kitchen knife, paper towels, disinfectant, vodka, ibuprofen.

As he walked through the huge aisles, that seemed so much longer than he remembered, he tried to ignore the looks of curiosity and disgust he saw on the faces of the other shoppers. By now his shoulder was clearly swollen, lumpy and bulging under his coat. One woman simply stood there, and pointed silently as Malcolm felt the tiny, stick-thin arm creep out from under his collar, trying to push the thick coat out of the way.

“Let me see, Malcolm. Let me see!””

[ITEMS TUMBLE, FOOTSTEPS FLEE]
Malcolm ran out of the store, dropping his items as he went. All except the kitchen knife.

[KEYS, FOLLOWED BY DOOR CREAKING OPEN]
The flat was dark and silent when Malcolm flung the door open, and fell inside in a heap. The pain in his shoulder was now unbearable as he clawed his way over the grimy, matted carpet, hands sticky from the decades of unnoticed dirt. The only light in the room spilled out from the static of the old television screen, casting his agonies in a pale and washed out cathode-ray glow.

His coat and the shirt beneath it were rags now, torn by the sharp, flailing fingers that reached out from his shoulder. Malcolm tried to breath, to concentrate or centre himself, to find any way to carve out a moment in the chaos and think. But there was none. He pulled off the remaining slivers of material, exposing the tiny, half-formed face and limbs to the open air. And he raised the knife.

“Do it, you coward!”

[VISCERAL SOUNDS OF BONE AND FLESH CRACKING AND CONTORTING]
As Malcolm plunged the blade into his shoulder, he felt it split. Skin, muscle and bone torn apart, opening up like an earthquake fissure, a red and gore-streaked chasm into himself. The sound he made could technically be called a scream, but the agonies he cried out through a gurgling throatful of blood were beyond any noise he could have conceived himself making.

[WET GURGLING NOISES ARE HEARD AS THE FLESHY NOISES GET WORSE]
From the wound came first a hand, then slowly, inch by inch, the arm followed, wrapping itself around his neck for purchase, and pulling out a shoulder, a neck, a face. A sneering, familiar face.

It took ten minutes for the bloody form to emerge in its entirety, and another twenty for it to writhe and crawl its way over and up onto the old armchair.

[DREADFUL VISCERAL SOUNDS WRITHE AND WHEEZE, LIKE LUNGS PULSING TO DRAW AIR]
Through all this time, Malcolm lay there, quietly bleeding, tears streaming down his cheek, and soaking into the carpet. The pain was nothing to him, not anymore. What he hated most, what he truly feared, was what stared down at him from that chair, that once again regarded him with sneering, bitter judgement. He could feel the old man’s eyes on him, and he knew that he would never be rid of them.

[STATIC RISES AND THEN FADES BACK TO THE EXTERIOR URBAN SOUNDS AND DRONES]
ARCHIVIST
Not exactly subtle. But then you never were, were you? Not really.

If that’s the most compelling argument you have…

Martin I’m, I’m sorry. You’re right, I –

Oh.

[COUGHS NERVOUSLY]
Sorry. Thought you were someone else.

CELIA
It’s okay. I-I was actually looking for you.

ARCHIVIST
Why? What’s – Sorry, um, do you know where Martin – the, the man I-I was with, do you know where he is?

CELIA
That’s what I wanted to check! I saw him a while ago, up near one of the trapdoors. I… I didn’t recognise the woman with him, so I wanted to check if you were expecting anyone else before I woke the prophets.

ARCHIVIST
[Suspicious] What, what woman?

CELIA
I don’t know.

ARCHIVIST
What did she look like?

CELIA
Uh… Youngish, Black, dressed… normal, I suppose. She had a thing on her head, like a… I don’t know. Like a, a woolly hat? But… I-I don’t know, it looked a bit weird.

ARCHIVIST
A-Annabelle, oh –

CELIA
I didn’t catch her name –

ARCHIVIST
Shh-shh! I –

Please, I need to concentrate.

Any luck?

ARCHIVIST
[Frustrated] Nothing. Is, is Georgie back yet?

MELANIE
Not yet. But then she needs to actually go places to look at them. She can’t just pop up top and check ‘the big picture’.

ARCHIVIST
Melanie, please, not now.

MELANIE
…

Sorry.

…

[SIGH]
So, you, you didn’t see them at all with your, y’know…?

ARCHIVIST
Nothing. They’re hidden. Annabelle must have taken the camera.

MELANIE
The camera?

ARCHIVIST
From Salesa’s.

MELANIE
O-oh. So does that mean he’s…?

ARCHIVIST
Dead.

MELANIE
Right.

ARCHIVIST
Yes. I checked. I guess she liked him enough to do that for him before she stole it.

MELANIE
Remind me not to get on her good side.

ARCHIVIST
No, i-it’s what he wanted. What he said he wanted. But… it-it-it means there’s no way I can find them!

MELANIE
Hey, hey, hey!

ARCHIVIST
And I –

MELANIE
Keep it together. Okay. Georgie might have better luck. She’s actually looking in person, and from what you said…

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. No. I, I mean, that could work.

But… But if she finds them alone! I mean, if anything were to happen!

MELANIE
They can handle themselves. Right?

ARCHIVIST
You’re right. You’re right.

MELANIE
It’s, it’s fine. I’m worried too.

ARCHIVIST
This is my fault.

MELANIE
What?

ARCHIVIST
We… We had an argument. I said some things I shouldn’t have. If, if I hadn’t we would have come back here together, and I-I’d have been there to stop her taking him.

MELANIE
You don’t know that’s what happened.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, he wouldn’t have gone willingly!

Would he?

MELANIE
You tell me. You said there was no sign of a struggle.

ARCHIVIST
But if it happened in the tunnel, I can’t ‘know’ that!

MELANIE
But we’d have heard. Stuff echoes down here.

ARCHIVIST
I suppose.

What? So you think he chose to leave with her?

MELANIE
Does it matter right now?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, if they left together willingly, they could already be miles away.

MELANIE
[Heavy sigh] Yeah. And you can’t – I, I don’t know, see where your blind spot is? I-If you know what I mean.

ARCHIVIST
Not unless I’m right next to it.

MELANIE
Right. Fine. So… we do this the old fashioned way.

Why would she take him? Uh, do they have any history?

ARCHIVIST
Not really.

MELANIE
So what other reason might she want him?

ARCHIVIST
To get to me? To turn him against us, or,or make him an offer or… I don’t know, she serves The Web, so it’s probably some bullshit domino cause-and-effect thing we can’t even begin to guess.

MELANIE
Okay. Probably, okay, but it doesn’t do us much good to worry about that now.

…

Uh, okay. Let’s say, she wanted to use him as bait, to lure you somewhere.

ARCHIVIST
Then why would she hide?

MELANIE
To get a headstart, maybe? So she can set up a trap. Either way, where would she go?

ARCHIVIST
[Exasperated] How am I supposed to know? I-I can’t see anything down here!

MELANIE
For god’s sake! Pull your head out of your arse, stop trying to use it as a bloody antenna, and actually try thinking!

ARCHIVIST
Just listen, Melanie. I – argh!

[THE ARCHIVIST IS STRUCK, NOT WITH A REVELATION BUT MELANIE’S CANE]
MELANIE
Think!

ARCHIVIST
Ow… I don’t know! Somewhere she’d be strong! A, a place of power, a, a Web domain…

MELANIE
Yeah… I, I don’t think there’s anywhere like that in London

ARCHIVIST
No, i-it’s all Eye, one way or another.

[STILL WATER PARTS UNDER OARBLADES OF A ROWING BOAT AND THE ARCHIVIST’S EXERTION IS CLEARLY AUDIBLE]
ARCHIVIST
[Weary] Come on. How much further can it be?

[EXTENDED SOUNDS OF TIRED ROWING]
The one time I’m on my own, and it’s a domain where –

Really? [chuckles] Now?

Fine.

[OARS ARE RETRACTED AS THE STATEMENT STATIC RISES]
[SOUNDS CHANGE AS IF NOW DEEP UNDERWATER, BUBBLING AND DARK, WITH THE SUGGESTION OF A BODY SWIMMING]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Down in the depths, there is a cold beyond cold. An icy, liquid chill that surrounds you, embraces you, pierces every inch of your naked gooseflesh skin with its needling touch, and gets inside your bones, the marrow frozen into nothing but agony. The shivers that wrack your body are so intense that when you stretch your arms or kick your legs to swim, their movements are wild, uncontrolled, pushing you through the water in shuddering bursts.

Water? Yes, you remember. The darkness around you, the forever of it all. Sometimes you forget just what it is that keeps you gripped so tight, suspended in place above nothing. But the thought comes to you quick enough when your lungs begin to burn. When did you last breathe? How much longer can you hold out? You consider for a moment opening yourself, simply letting it in, drowning. What are you so afraid of? But you know there is no release in it. You have been drowning as long as you can remember, and to invite the impossible cold into yourself, through your lungs and into your core, will bring no end to it, no relief. So you hold on. You hold out as long as you can, ignoring the agony, straining against the pressing darkness that has consumed you, and that implores you to consume it in return.

There is air above you. You know that. Far, far above is the surface, the inky stillness of that silent barrier between water and sky, motionless as black glass, an obsidian expanse that stretches away. You could break that stillness, shatter its peace as you emerge, clawing, spluttering into the air. But the idea repels you. Your heart seizes at the thought, and your blood shoots through with a cold that has nothing to do with the water. Why does your mind recoil and beg you to stay down, to hold fast in the darkness, to simply keep drowning?

Just swim, that’s the key. Pick a direction, and swim until you find something. Someone. Land perhaps, or just another who is suffering as you are. Were you doing that already? Which way have you been going? The shivers that pass convulsively through your body make it so hard to tell for sure, and no light will condescend to reach down here. But still you press on, try to keep moving through the pain, through the fear that attempts to paralyse you, to lock you in place as surely as the water that presses all around. How long have you been moving now? Seconds? Years? Your lungs still burn and beg you to succumb.

Something moves. Something deep and old, and larger than your frostbitten imagination can conceive. You cannot see it, you cannot hear it, but you feel it. The water shifts and pushes against you, spinning you around, and tearing apart your thin idea of up and down. It is coming closer, its smooth motion relentless as an iron bell tolling in the silence. It is close.

Closer.

It is here.

You can feel its titanic bulk moving past, just below you. Or perhaps above. It almost brushes against you and, despite the pressure of the water all around you, you cannot fight the frantic instinct to run. Your legs begin to move, flailing, and where your feet press against it you feel its skin, rough and leathery, strangely almost dry despite the ocean through which it moves, and sharp enough that you feel it tear through the soft flesh on the soles of your feet. There is no pain, simply a wave of sickened nausea that passes up through your legs and into your stomach. You keep moving, limbs splaying in that strange pseudo-run, moving along it, and begging for this thing to end. Sometimes your feet do not land upon its skin, but press on something else. Something smooth and hard that feels like bone. Or tooth.

And then it is gone, passed away from you, and out into the expanse of dark and quiet cold. You cannot stay down here. The darkness hides terrible things, and your whole chest screams for air. You take a moment and focus, concentrate on the feeling of the water around you, the gentle pull that promises to be down, and then you begin to swim, a desperate crawl up through the black towards the vague hope of a surface.

You do not know how long you have been swimming, how far you have climbed, but when you thrust your hand forward you feel something change. It is a sudden release, a weightless freedom that seems so alien to you now. A new panic begins to overtake you, but it is too late, as your whole body rips through the unbroken surface of the sea and into open air.

[RIPPLING SOUNDS AS IF A WATERY BARRIER IS BREACHED]
You feel dark water explode from your throat in something that is half-screaming, half-disgorging foul and icy liquid, and you take a breath. The air burns, perhaps a new feeling, or perhaps one long forgotten, and you open your eyes.

[SOUNDS OF COUGHING AND GASPING FOR AIR, ALONG WITH TREADING WATER & SPLASHES]
There is… nothing.

You look around you, neck twisting violently, trying to take it all in, but the ocean that stretches away is smooth against the reddened sky, unchanging. There is nothing else. No boat to save you, no land to make your escape, not even another lost soul who shares your torments. Deep down, in the icy depths, you could imagine… you could hope. The darkness hides terrible things, but it could also hide salvation. You cannot know what is down there, but up here it is laid out in such terrible stark detail that there is nothing. You only know you are crying because the water on your face is warm enough that it feels like fire upon your cheek.

[FAINT SOBBING JOINS THE OTHER WATERY SOUNDS]
And beyond that, up in the sky you feel it. Looking down on you in something approaching delight, drinking in your despair and bitter dread. Enjoying your misery and terror as you cast about for something that might be hope. It disgusts you, the waves of smug satisfaction that pervade your being as it stares at you. You cannot bear for it to see you like this. It makes you want to scream, but you know your screams are exactly what it wants.

[SPLASH TO DIVE BELOW THE SURFACE]
You choke it down, and slip once again below the surface. Into the concealing darkness of the freezing waters below, and you leave behind the nothing that waits above.

[THE ARCHIVIST AND BASIRA WENT TO SEA IN A RICKETY WOODEN BOAT… AKA BOAT PULLS UP TO A SHINGLE SHORE, FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL, PASSENGER BOARDS AND THEY SHOVE OFF]
BASIRA
How did you find me?

Oh, right. Obviously.

Thanks.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, uh, you’re welcome?

BASIRA
What?

ARCHIVIST
No-Nothing. I-I just… I was worried you might be upset if I interrupted your whole ‘solo reflection’ thing.

BASIRA
It’s fine. I mean, I would have at first but… honestly? There are a bunch more hells between me and London than I thought.

[THE ARCHIVIST KINDA CHUCKLES]
I’ve been hoping for a friendly face for a while now.

ARCHIVIST
Glad I could oblige.

[ROWING CONTINUES]
BASIRA
Not that I couldn’t make it on my own.

ARCHIVIST
Of course.

[MORE BOATING]
BASIRA
You’re not… You’re not here to just give me a lift are you?

ARCHIVIST
I need your help.

BASIRA
You need my help? I thought you were basically a god now?

ARCHIVIST
Annabelle Cane has Martin.

BASIRA
Shit.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

BASIRA
When? How?

ARCHIVIST
I think she’s taking him to Hill Top Road, and… I don’t know, I just – I needed someone I could trust, and I couldn’t ask Georgie or Melanie to come all this way, so –

BASIRA
They’re alive?

ARCHIVIST
Oh, uh, y-yes, I, um…

BASIRA
Oh, it’s, it’s fine, you can catch me up later. Let’s focus on the Martin situation.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
Can you, y’know, ‘see’ him?

ARCHIVIST
No. A-Annabelle has a – Sh-She can block The Eye. There’s a, a camera. It’s an artefact that was protecting Salesa’s – Right. So, um, shortly after we left you we found –

BASIRA
Magic camera that keeps them hidden. Got it.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

BASIRA
So they’re at Hill Top Road?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
And you’re sure? Even if you can’t see them?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
And you know the way?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
So what are we waiting for? Stop messing around, let’s go.

ARCHIVIST
[Irritated] I’m not messing ar– Right. Of course.

[LONG MOMENTS PASS WITH THE ARCHIVIST’S AUDIBLE EXERTIONS]
BASIRA
It’s lucky for me you needed help. I just got out of this weird mirror-maze thing, and then I was just… on an island. I was seriously considering swimming.

ARCHIVIST
That would not have been a good idea.

[SUDDENLY THE BOAT IS JOSTLED FROM BENEATH, RIPPLING WATER AND SPLASHES UNTIL IT SETTLES]
BASIRA
I don’t remember there being a huge lake between London and Oxford.

ARCHIVIST
That’s because there wasn’t one.

BASIRA
Right.

I’m a bit over the whole horror-geography thing at this point.

ARCHIVIST
That makes two of us.

BASIRA
So I’m guessing it represents academic isolation or something? Maybe something to do with ‘the dangerous unknown’, skimming to the surface, that kind of thing?

ARCHIVIST
[Weary] Maybe it just represents the feeling of sore arms.

BASIRA
Been rowing a while, then?

ARCHIVIST
Hard to say. Certainly feels that way.

BASIRA
Yeah, you look like crap.

ARCHIVIST
Thanks.

BASIRA
You’re welcome.

ARCHIVIST
I’m trying to think of it as a metaphor.

BASIRA
And that helps?

ARCHIVIST
Not at all.

I’d be more than happy to let you take over, if you’d like?

BASIRA
No, I wouldn’t want to cramp your style.

ARCHIVIST
At this point, that’s just about the only part of me that isn’t cramping.

BASIRA
Alright, give ‘em here.

ARCHIVIST
Here you go.

[OARS ARE TRANSFERRED AND BASIRA BEGINS TO BOAT]
BASIRA
Okay. So… what do we know about Hill Top Road?

ARCHIVIST
Not much.

BASIRA
Another blind spot?

ARCHIVIST
No, it’s – I could look at it, but it… it was… it was like a… a hole. You know that feeling you get when you look down from a, a great height, like you’re being pulled into the abyss?

BASIRA
Kind of?

ARCHIVIST
[Getting lost in thought] Well it was… was like that. Normally I can see it, see the… webs, and feel the power of The Spider emanating from it, but… as I would look… it’s like my mind…. follows the paths of The Web,

[STATIC RISES]
the strands going down and… out… [Catching self] It’s quite disorientating.

[STATIC FADES]
BASIRA
So what? It’s like a… a Web-Vast team-up?

ARCHIVIST
Almost, but… no. It… It’s different. Something else. Either way the important thing is that right now, I can’t see it at all.

BASIRA
So we know they’re there with the magic camera.

ARCHIVIST
Exactly.

BASIRA
[Sighs] And we’re charging off into the unknown again? It’s just like old times.

ARCHIVIST
Old times wasn’t actually all that long ago.

BASIRA
Hmm. True. Feels it, though doesn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Well, hopefully this one will go a bit better.

BASIRA
Would be hard for it to go worse.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[ROW, ROW, ROW THEIR BOAT…]
So… how was the trip down? How are you doing?

BASIRA
Not great. But I think I’m doing better having done it.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah?

BASIRA
I always used to think I was helping people get what they deserved you know?

But then you see people suffering like this, with their deepest fears everywhere, and it’s people who I’d say were good people, or bad people or… And there are avatars, jailors and torturers, and some of them seem to hate it as much as the people they’re guarding. But they still do it…

I don’t know. I guess it’s… It’s hard to look back on what I did as all that different.

[Bitter laugh] Bit late for self-discovery though, right? After the world’s ended?

ARCHIVIST
We’re still here.

BASIRA
True. But I don’t really know what I even am anymore? Am I an avatar, or what?

ARCHIVIST
Technically… yes. I think you might have effectively inherited Daisy’s role. That’s very much The Hunt’s thing, isn’t it? You kill, and then you become?

BASIRA
[Mournfully] Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Sorry. What I mean is, Daisy moved through the domains, tormenting you with the chase, but also spreading fear wherever she went, and watching the results with hungry eyes. I think that’s what you’re doing now: travelling through, seeing places, and feeding The Eye with your observations. And your revulsions.

BASIRA
[Exhales] So I’m what? Just a freelance watcher?

ARCHIVIST
If you like. You’ll probably end up with your own domain, eventually.

BASIRA
But if it’s The Hunt, what am I supposed to be chasing? All I’ve been doing is wandering around, hoping I might find something to do, some way to help –

Ah.

Damn it.

ARCHIVIST
And there it is.

[MORE ROWING]
BASIRA
So catch me up. What’s been happening? You found Melanie and Georgie?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, they found me.

BASIRA
So I was right, then?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know what you mean.

BASIRA
Yeah, you do. Just after that meat factory, we were talking, and I said maybe you couldn’t see them because Georgie couldn’t feel fear and Melanie had cut herself off from The Eye. And then you said that –

ARCHIVIST
I said it was plausible.

BASIRA
Yeah, but you did the face when you said it.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. You were right.

BASIRA
So does this mean there are others?

ARCHIVIST
What do you mean?

BASIRA
Like, they can’t be the only ones like that, right? Maybe there are other people out there, naturally immune, wandering around or hunkered down?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, maybe. I mean, probably. But, y’know, well, I can’t see them, can I?

BASIRA
Ah, yeah. Suppose not.

[MORE ROWING]
ARCHIVIST
I also killed Helen.

BASIRA
Oh.

Right.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[CONSIDERED ROWING]
BASIRA
Didn’t expect that.

ARCHIVIST
She was dangerous. And not like the others out there. It was only going to be a matter of time before –

BASIRA
No, no, I get it.

Honestly, it’s kind of a relief. How did Melanie take it?

ARCHIVIST
Melanie?

BASIRA
Yeah. She and… She and Helen were pretty tight back when, uh… Oh.

ARCHIVIST
What?

BASIRA
Back when you were in your coma.

ARCHIVIST
I see. Well, I haven’t told her yet. So, I suppose I have that to look forward to when we get back.

BASIRA
If we get back.

ARCHIVIST
That’s not the part I’m worried about.

BASIRA
He’ll be okay.

ARCHIVIST
Hmm.

BASIRA
I know a good way to take your mind off it.

ARCHIVIST
I wouldn’t want to cramp your style.

BASIRA
Ha!

[FOOTSTEPS ON A DIRT TRACK]
BASIRA
So we’re just gonna leave the boat?

ARCHIVIST
Would it make you feel better to know that it’s not technically real?

BASIRA
No.

ARCHIVIST
Look, it’s fine. We probably won’t even be coming back this way.

BASIRA
If you say so.

So anyway, run this by me again, they’re like a proper cult, cult?

ARCHIVIST
Ish. They all seemed fairly normal given the circumstances. Bit of a let-down in some ways.

BASIRA
But like, they actually worship Melanie and Georgie?

ARCHIVIST
Worship is maybe a bit strong. They just… revere them.

BASIRA
[Laughs] Melanie must hate that.

ARCHIVIST
And that’s the issue. I’d say it’s as culty as it can be, when the ‘leaders’ are actively trying to stop it.

BASIRA
Must have been funny though –

Huh.

Hang on, is that – ? That’s the real sun isn’t it?

Yes. We’ve entered the, uh… um…

John?

ARCHIVIST
Sorry, I should have said. The camera, it… it blocks my connection, and I, uh… It’s hard.

It doesn’t matter. Martin’s here, and we need to find him.

BASIRA
Shh! Do you hear that?

There. In the… the spider web. Great.

ANNABELLE

Perhaps the whole ‘answer a question with a question’ thing is wearing a bit thin. Besides which it’s a bit late to play coy. You promised me an actual straight answer.

ANNABELLE
You’d have it a lot more quickly if you didn’t keep stopping.

MARTIN
Hey, this is your magic bubble. You’re the one making it so that we’re, like, actually walking, walking all the way to Oxford. So sorry I’ve got to sit down occasionally, like a human.

ANNABELLE
And the book breaks?

MARTIN
It’s not like you’re entertaining company.

ANNABELLE
And it’s nothing to do with the fact that any lost souls in our area also get a break from their torment? Hmmm?

MARTIN
…

So what if it does? Is that a problem?

ANNABELLE
Actually, I find it very reassuring.

MARTIN
Great, because I’m still going to need to rest. Some of these houses have actual beds, and I haven’t slept on a mattress since Sa–

[FOOTSTEPS SLOW, THEN STOP]
Hmm.

ANNABELLE
Problem?

MARTIN
Did he suffer?

ANNABELLE
Did who suffer?

MARTIN
Just… answer the question.

ANNABELLE
No.

I did it in his sleep.

He’d always been accommodating, so… I wanted to honour his wishes.

MARTIN
That’s a shame.

ANNABELLE
Is it?

MARTIN
I mean… he seemed nice. To us at least.

ANNABELLE
And what of his victims? The people whose lives he destroyed?

MARTIN
…

I can’t speak for them. I didn’t know them, did I?

ANNABELLE
No. You didn’t.

[FOOTSTEPS RESUME]
MARTIN
[Sighs] Is it much further?

ANNABELLE
Less so than last time you asked.

MARTIN
Could you just try answering a question properly? Just once?

ANNABELLE
…

We’re close now. Just a few more streets.

MARTIN
Thank you.

…

Oh. Uhh… Huh. Um…

ANNABELLE
Oh come on, Martin. You didn’t really expect him to find us before we got here, did you?

MARTIN
[Unconvincing] N… no…

ANNABELLE
We have a sizable lead, and the camera too, don’t forget. Besides, even if he did ‘ride to your rescue’, what then? Would you explain to him that you’re here of your own free will?

MARTIN
I mean, that’s a pretty generous way to describe being blackmailed.

ANNABELLE
Oh, it’s blackmail, is it? Offering you a way out of all this?

MARTIN
You said if I told John or waited then you’d leave, and I’d never know.

ANNABELLE
And you believed me, which was very gracious of you.

MARTIN
[Sputters slightly] I shouldn’t have.

ANNABELLE
Why not? I didn’t lie to you, I do have another option for you. One that means neither of you need to die or be consumed by any dark power.

MARTIN
Oh, but you can’t just tell me or John. Oh no, no, that would be far too straightforward.

ANNABELLE
I could.

[MARTIN SIGHS]
But it’s much better if you see it for yourselves. And he would not have come willingly. He needs to think he’s coming for you.

MARTIN
He can see literally everything. I’m sure he probably knows it already.

ANNABELLE
In a way, perhaps. But I guarantee that being here in person is something very different.

Come on.

MARTIN
Hey, is that – ? You told me not to bring a tape recorder.

ANNABELLE
No. I said we wouldn’t need one. We have plenty of tapes.

MARTIN
But then –

ANNABELLE
We’re here.

[FOOTSTEPS CEASE]
MARTIN
This is it?

ANNABELLE
Ah, I forget. You’ve never actually been here before, have you?

Well? What do you think?

MARTIN
It’s… I-I mean, it’s, um…

ANNABELLE
Just a house?

MARTIN
Well… well, yeah.

ANNABELLE
What were you expecting?

MARTIN
I don’t know, like… something a bit more dramatic, I guess.

ANNABELLE
We’ll see what we can do.

[FOOTSTEPS, THEN CREAKING AS ANNABELLE OPENS THE DOOR]
[Dramatically] Step into my parlour.

MARTIN
Hmmm.

Fine.

[FOOTSTEPS AS MARTIN FOLLOWS, CHANGING FROM PAVEMENT TO WOOD]
[DOOR CLOSES BEHIND HIM]
ANNABELLE
Do take a seat.

[MARTIN PUTS DOWN BAG, TAKES A SEAT]
MARTIN
[Warily] So… What now?

ANNABELLE
I’ve written you a statement. I would like for you to read it.

[PAPER RUSTLING, THEN FOOTSTEPS]
MARTIN
And if I don’t?

ANNABELLE
Then we sit here in silence until the Archivist arrives. But I would suggest you do read it. I believe you’ll find it… illuminating.

[A LONG PAUSE BEFORE MARTIN SIGHS HEAVILY]
MARTIN
Screw it. Fine.

Fine.

MARTIN (STATEMENT)
[THROUGHOUT THERE IS THE OCCASIONAL RUSTLING OF PAPER AND CREAK OF WOOD]
Once there was a house, a building that, for all it might have looked like those around it, was not the same.

Stop, no.

It didn’t start with the house. It was here long before any might have thought of it as a home.

Once, there was a patch of land, not quite as firm in this reality as that which surrounded it.

Stop, no.

It’s not about the land. Mud and soil has no part in what is there.

Once, there was a point in space that did not quite obey all those petty rules that decide what can be allowed to happen in a world.

Stop, no.

It’s not a point in space. The Earth spins and hurtles through the darkness, but it still carries it along.

Let us simply say that once there was a place. A place where the universe had… cracked.

None of us remember what had caused the crack, not even those things beyond time who might measure a generation in the echoes of their screams. It has been there as long as they have, if not longer. It’s not a large crack, and to walk by it, even through it, you’d never pause to notice. Perhaps the air around it is slightly thinner, lights slightly dimmer… In the summer there may be the slightest chill. In the winter a warmth that is almost unsettling. The fungus that grows in the damp there is somehow more vibrant in its whiteness, while flowers remain duller than those that neighbour them. But these changes are slight, and none have dwelt on them long enough to call the place cursed. Indeed, few have ever thought much of it at all. Perhaps there are many such places across the Earth. Perhaps it is unique. Certainly, no-one has known either way.

The first to build a home upon that spot was named Eowa. He was a Saxon, and a coward, who had fled the field against the Mercian king, and sought to find his peace there. His squalid little hut was far removed from those of his once-kinsmen. Nonetheless, there he lived and worked, and tried hopelessly to forget the stench of blood and rot, and the feel of a seax knife in the wound he carried to the end of his life. Did his terror call to him with the drumbeat voice of carnage? Did it sing to him with the squirming melody of decay? Could any have told you the difference?

It is strange. That a name, a face, a taste of fear should linger through the centuries, and yet I cannot be sure which of them it was that ate so well. Some fears are eternal, but within them lie a hundred titles, whispered in the secret places of every era of every corner of our world. Who can say if any of them are true?

Whichever it might have been, they knew Eowa’s terrors well. Until he was no longer there. Until he awoke in a place that was a place but… somewhere else. Somewhere the Mercians had pushed further, had taken more. For all his dread of a violent death, his end was quick and clean. And none of his kinsmen ever knew his fate. His hut, left unattended, quickly fell to disrepair, then to collapse. No-one used the wood; the grain was warped.

[BIRDS TWITTER FAINTLY]
Many lived in that spot across the following years. Some in peace, some in misery, a few in strangled fear. But none tied their sorrows to the land or the dwelling they might have erected upon it. The village slowly grew, and became a more populous town though not ever a remarkable one. That said, perhaps, sometimes, in the quiet, those who tried to make it their home might have felt a whisper, an echo of some other place, some place not quite their own. But it never disturbed their sleep.

So what does it mean, for a place to be haunted? A place can be haunted by someone, some poor soul whose bones lie restless in the shallow soil. It can be haunted by something, some crime or atrocity that indelibly marked itself upon the soul of a spot. But can it be haunted by somewhere? An echo of worlds that are not our own, alien pasts that draw to unknown presents, leaking through the smallest, narrowest crack at the very edge of existence?

The closest anyone ever came to knowing was a man named Geoffrey Neckam, a scholar from the University. He bought the house that then sat there from a bow-legged milliner whose name he never bothered to learn, seeking some peace and removal from his more raucous colleagues. He was a man of God, of course, but also a keen master of natural philosophy, a study he put to use when he first felt the oddities that pervaded his new home – the strange draughts that shifted his candle flame, the gentle murmur that almost sounded like voices. Once he even found a new room, though he very wisely did not enter it.

His investigations were crude, of course, convinced as he was that it was some working of his God; an unseen passage to a heavenly sphere, perhaps, or, as he more often feared, an infernal one. That said, his observations were surprisingly astute, and his rubric of belief closer to the truth than you might imagine. But Geoffrey Neckam had neither the words to talk of dimensions, nor a mind able to meaningfully conceive of worlds beyond the one within which he lived, and its requisite afterlives of course. And so, as a result all his mediations and his intellect ultimately lead him nowhere.

They were not, however, entirely in vain. Because, you see, Geoffrey Neckam lived in fear. There was a reason he chose to live apart from his peers, why he cooked his own paltry meals in privacy, and avoided academic meetings. He was certain that his scholastic rivals were somehow plotting against him, weaving intricate schemes to ruin his reputation and cost him his position, even take his life. It was this obsession that first brought him to the attention of Mother-of-Puppets, the Great Spider, and how we became aware of what this place was. What it might mean.

Eventually, the long-awaited knife in the dark did indeed find its way into the belly of Geoffrey Neckam. But by then his only meaningful work was done, and another, altogether grander plan, was now in motion.

It was no easy task, keeping the place close through the ages, working all the while to weaken that crack, luring in the servants of other powers, and so in the resulting clash, pressing ever harder against the edges of our reality.

For a while it belonged to a sculptor of puppets, who made his strings from the tendons of those he felt did not appreciate his art, and he would dance them around in a mocking effigy. He was, in time, slain by a crusading hunter of the Reformation, who would let no heresy go unanswered. He was bisected with his own wood saw.

Once there lived there a writer of anonymous letters, who could not have told you where his secrets came from, only that he knew the darkest desires of many souls, and had the wit to use them to their best effect. He was deemed a civil war traitor and buried alive deep beneath the house in which he had drawn his schemes by a man whose teeth were always stained with mud.

So many schemers and spiders and full-throated monsters. Twisting manipulators and furtive liars. Each meeting a violent, grotesque end; each widening the crack just a little. Until finally, a man named Raymond Fielding, a smiling pillar of the community who fostered children into food for his grotesque arachnid god, was murdered by flame, immolated by the Chosen of the Ravening Burn. The house of the time was destroyed along with him, reduced to ashes, and with that the crack finally became… a gap. A hole around which time, dimension and reality began to bend, shudder and leak.

An opening into, we believe, other worlds than this tired old thing.

It was not wide enough to allow true passage, not yet, save for the odd accident. But it was wide enough for what we now intended…

[MARTIN EXHALES]
MARTIN
Okay.

So.

A crack in reality?

ANNABELLE
Oh, it’s so much more than a crack now. It’s an aching hole, a gaping wound in the very fabric of our world.

MARTIN
And a gateway to other dimensions.

ANNABELLE
Not quite yet.

[MARTIN EXHALES SLOWLY AS HE PROCESSES]
MARTIN
Oooooookay.

ANNABELLE
Dramatic enough for you?

MARTIN
So this is what you wanted me to see?

…

Annabelle?

ANNABELLE
[Wistful] It’s a real shame, you know. I was so looking forward to filling you with spiders.

MARTIN
E– Wh– Excuse me?

ANNABELLE
They would have hollowed you out, and worn you like a cheery jumper!

MARTIN
Uh, right. But, since you’re telling me I can assume you’re not going to now, right?

ANNABELLE
That’s the thing about webs. People get so caught up on how intricate they are, how perfectly constructed. They never consider how flexible they can be. The sort of storm they need to weather. You can’t be precious about a single strand.

MARTIN
R-Right, yeah, but a-a-again, because you didn’t really answer me, um, filling me with spiders isn’t a strand of your web now, right? Um. I-I just want us to be, heh, absolutely clear on this.

A-Annabelle?

ANNABELLE
…

No.

[MARTIN IS RELIEVED]
Not anymore.

MARTIN
R-R-Right, thanks. Sorry. S-S-Sorry to interrupt, just, just checking.

ANNABELLE
It’s such a shame. There was a time when I was certain you had what it takes to join us.

MARTIN
What? Because I like spiders? Well, used to.

ANNABELLE
Because you always managed to get what you wanted through smiles and shrugs and stammerings that weren’t nearly as awkward as they seemed.

[SMALL SOUND OF MARTIN’S CONCESSION TO THE POINT]
MARTIN
Point taken.

ANNABELLE
But I didn’t foresee how deep you would fall into The Lonely. Or how far the Archivist would go to get you back. It made things… awkward.

MARTIN
Why are you telling me all this?

ANNABELLE
[Strained] Because… explaining things, giving answers, like this… it’s not what I am. It’s difficult, against my nature.

And I’m trying to practice.

MARTIN
Why?

ANNABELLE
Why do you think?

[MARTIN GROANS]
Sorry.

MARTIN
Okay, let’s try a different question. What was your plan?

ANNABELLE
I was going to snatch you away. Lure you both into this web, and then take you. Drive him to despair, so that when you returned to him, bulging, and talking in a thousand tiny voices, it would drive him to a final push.

MARTIN
And now?

ANNABELLE
[Sighs] Your bond is too complicated. I couldn’t drive that kind of rift between you now. I’ve considered every angle, examined every cause and effect, and have finally come to the conclusion that I… [sighs] I need to tell you the truth, to explain things.

MARTIN
[Frustrated] Yeah, but why?

ANNABELLE
Because if I do… you’ll do as I ask.

MARTIN
Oh, will we?

ANNABELLE
Yes.

[ANNABELLE TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND A FEW PACES]
He’s nearly here.

MARTIN
John?

ANNABELLE
Let’s make the setting a little more… appropriate, shall we?

MARTIN
Hey, just… ah, hah, p-put the camera down, okay?

ANNABELLE
You said you wanted something more “dramatic”, right?

MARTIN
Wh-What? No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait… wait –

[ANNABELLE CHUCKLES, THEN HEFTS THE CAMERA INTO THE GROUND]
[GLASS SHATTERS AS HARSH STATIC CRACKLES AND CRACKS AND TWISTS THE SCENE… WIND WHIPS AROUND AS THEY STAND ON AN IMPOSSIBLE WEB STRETCHED ACROSS A GAPING CHASM]
MARTIN
[Distorted] Ooooh shit…

That’s a long way down

ANNABELLE
Further than you can possibly imagine.

[MARTIN QUIVERS AUDIBLY]
[STICKY SOUNDS SLAP WETLY AS ANNABELLE SLINGS WEB]
MARTIN
Oi! W-What’re you – ? Urgh! Urgh. What i–? What – ? What is this?

ANNABELLE
What do you think? It’s for your safety. So you don’t do anything… unpredictable. I’d hate for you to fall.

[WIND CONTINUES AS THUNDEROUS RUMBLES AND BUZZING INSECTS INTRUDE AUDITORILY]
MARTIN
When John gets here, he is going to kill you.

[MARTIN CONTINUES TO EXPRESS HIS DISGUST AT THE SILKEN RESTRAINTS]
ANNABELLE
As long as he listens to me first, it won’t matter.

MARTIN
Wait. Wait…

The tapes…

ANNABELLE
A fine material to spin a web with, don’t you think?

MARTIN
What? All this time, through all of this, it, it was just you spying on us?

ANNABELLE
Oh Martin. You have no idea who’s listening, do you?

[CAREFUL, STICKY, MOVEMENT BY THE ARCHIVIST AND BASIRA AS CHITTERING, BUZZING AND AN ABYSSAL VOID ECHOES AROUND THEM]

BASIRA
[Sighs] It’s fine, the stickiness helps.

[ARCHIVIST GRUNTS]
Come on.

ARCHIVIST
Right behind you.

BASIRA
Feeling better now are we? Without those horrible sunny skies and fresh winds?

ARCHIVIST
Yes, the colossal web stretching down into an endless pit is a significant improvement.

BASIRA
Don’t pretend like you’re joking.

ARCHIVIST
At least I can think straight now. So we have a chance to – Don’t touch that one!

[BASIRA BRUSHES AGAINST A STRAND WHICH THRUMS AND ECHOES WITH HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALS, AND THE CADENCE OF BUZZING SOUNDS CHANGE WITH THE REVERBERATIONS]
BASIRA
Sorry.

ARCHIVIST
…

It’s okay. She already knew I was here, I just… I hoped we might be able to sneak you in.

BASIRA
I’m guessing she’s waiting at the centre?

[STATIC OF KNOWING RISES FAINTLY]
ARCHIVIST
Naturally. They both are. Martin is… he’s okay. He’s… scared, but also… frustrated.

BASIRA
You can’t see Annabelle’s plan?

ARCHIVIST
I know she has something to tell me… and i-it’s about the hole below us… her thoughts are all down there… and the threads are so closely woven, I-I follow them out and in and down and through the strands of web and twisting tape and down and down and down into the chasm into the emptiness that stretches out below –

BASIRA
Woah! Woah!

[ARCHIVIST LOSES BALANCE BUT BASIRA STEADIES HIM AS STATIC FADES]
Careful! Careful.

ARCHIVIST
Thanks.

There’s a – Sorry, there’s a s-sort of pull to it.

[THEY BOTH SIGH IN VARYING MANNERS OF RELIEF]
Every time I get a glimpse of it, it draws me in…

BASIRA
What’s down there?

ARCHIVIST
I don’t know.

BASIRA
That makes a change.

ARCHIVIST
It’s… somewhere else.

That’s all I’ve got.

[THE ARCHIVIST EXHALES HEAVILY THEN STICKY FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE]
BASIRA
So. The tapes. They’re from the Web, then?

ARCHIVIST
Looks like it.

BASIRA
Were they always? Right from the start?

ARCHIVIST
As far as I can tell, it’s hard to s– If I look too closely at them, my own voice, things get… recursive, hard to follow.

BASIRA
I always assumed they were with The Eye. The whole ‘watching, listening, waiting’ thing, y’know?

ARCHIVIST
No, they were always using them to spin their own web. Out of my words.

BASIRA
Mine too.

ARCHIVIST
True.

BASIRA
But what for? And why here?

ARCHIVIST
I, uh –

[TRIES TO ‘KNOW’ BUT GOES UNSTEADY AS STATIC BRIEFLY RISES ALONG WITH HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALS]
BASIRA
Forget I asked.

ARCHIVIST
Oh! Ooh. Hmm.

BASIRA
Can’t keep catching you every two minutes.

ARCHIVIST
Heh.

BASIRA
At some point I’ll give in to the temptation.

ARCHIVIST
[Sarcastic] Hah hah.

BASIRA
Different question, then. How do we play this one?

ARCHIVIST
You get Martin to safety, then I deal with Annabelle Cane.

BASIRA
Right.

I think we should hear her out first.

ARCHIVIST
Excuse me?

BASIRA
Before you “deal with her”, we should try to get some answers. All of this… taking Martin… she wants to talk.

ARCHIVIST
She’s had plenty of chances. She didn’t need to kidnap him.

BASIRA
Sure, but maybe she –

What? What’s with the look?

ARCHIVIST
How are you feeling, Basira?

BASIRA
[Sharply] Do you want to look inside my head? See if it’s full of spiders?

ARCHIVIST
I –

No, I’m sorry. I-I trust you.

BASIRA
How are you feeling?

ARCHIVIST
[Sighs] Yes, alright, you don’t need to make a point.

BASIRA
Yes I do. You’re too close to this, and I need to make sure you aren’t going to do anything dumb.

Situation like this, we can’t make rash assumptions. Right?

ARCHIVIST
Right.

But if she hurts Martin, all bets are off.

BASIRA
If she hurts Martin, I’ll be right there with you.

[MARTIN HAS GIVEN UP STRUGGLING, RESTRAINED IN WEBBING TO THE CHAIR]
ANNABELLE
He’s getting close.

MARTIN
[Archly] As if you could hear him over all this racket.

ANNABELLE
[Chuckles] I am sorry you find them irritating.

They’re a side effect of the very specific way this web has been spun.

I thought you liked his voice?

MARTIN
I do, when it’s his voice. I’ve never liked the statements. It always felt – Yeah.

ANNABELLE
Well, you can trust me when I say you’ll be hearing his real voice very soon.

MARTIN
I can’t see anything. How can you tell?

ANNABELLE
Vibrations.

MARTIN
Urgh, yes, web, vibrations, sure. But that’s not actually what’s happening here is it? So why don’t you just tell me straight? It’s not like I’m going to run off. I’d only trip over my own feet and fall in, even if I tried.

ANNABELLE
It’s a good way to visualise these things. Symbols and metaphor… they give easy channels for the Great Powers to flow through. Ready forms for their energy to manifest.

MARTIN
Blah, blah, dream logic, blah. I’ve had this lecture before.

ANNABELLE
You’d prefer we stay silent until he arrives?

MARTIN
I’d hardly call this silence.

ANNABELLE
I’d stop them if I could.

MARTIN
Fine.

Let’s talk, then.

ANNABELLE
Alright.

[THE PAUSE IS LONG AND AWKWARD]
Is there anything you want to talk about?

MARTIN
I don’t know! It’s kind of hard to think of small talk suspended over an endless void!

ANNABELLE
You’re perfectly safe as long as you don’t do anything foolish and unstick yourself.

MARTIN
Ah, yeah, yeah. You say that, but it seems like you’ve got this whole thing prepared for John, and I don’t really know whether I should be trying to derail it, or whether that’s just what you want me to do, and, and so doing nothing is actually the right thing, y’know? And… you’re a hard person to talk to.

ANNABELLE
Why? Because of what I say, or because of the assumptions you make about my motives?

MARTIN
Either. Both.

ANNABELLE
I see.

[ANOTHER FRUSTRATING PAUSE]
We could play a game?

MARTIN
Uhhh…

ANNABELLE
Twenty questions? Animal, vegetable or mineral?

MARTIN
Animal. Does it have eight legs? Yes. Is it a spider? Yes. Oh look, I win.

ANNABELLE
[Smiling] On edge, are we?

MARTIN
Of course I am! You’ve stuck me in a weird interdimensional web, and threatened to fill me with spiders!

ANNABELLE
No. I said I had “considered” filling you with spiders.

MARTIN
Yeah, whatever. The point is there was a time when it was very much your go-to option! And this one time I chose to almost trust you, you’ve immediately turned around and used me as bait!

ANNABELLE
I haven’t broken your trust.

MARTIN
Wh-What?

The deal was you’d tell me a way to end this without John trapping himself in that tower. Using me to trap him here instead, in the most hackneyed metaphor imaginable, is not exactly what I had in mind.

ANNABELLE
Perhaps I was wrong about how well suited you are to us. I’m not sure you have the patience for The Web.

MARTIN
Oh, piss off.

ANNABELLE
…

You don’t need to worry about John.

MARTIN
You’re literally luring him into a trap. This trap. This one right here.

[MARTIN MOTIONS AND TWANGS THE WEB, SETTING OFF STRONG REVERBERATIONS]
ANNABELLE
Please don’t do that.

Technically, yes. This is a trap. But the only one in actual danger is going to be me. If he chooses to kill me, I can’t stop him. Not even here. And you’re not bait, you’re just… an invitation.

MARTIN
Oh. Wonderful. I can’t wait to attend the Annabelle Cane Show.

ANNABELLE
Huh! You know, I did consider it once.

MARTIN
Excuse me?

ANNABELLE
A TV show. Reaching out into the homes of millions, giving the more vulnerable ones a subtle nudge towards terror. Probably something for children. It never went anywhere, of course. These things rarely do.

MARTIN
I’m, I’m sorry, what are you talking about?

ANNABELLE
You’re the one that didn’t want to wait in silence.

MARTIN
W– Yeah, well –

[CHITTERING, BUZZING AND HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALS CHANGE CADENCE]
Wait… Wait, hang on, is that him?

ANNABELLE
Yes. I guess you’re better with the Web than we thought.

MARTIN
And – Wait, ha– No, uh… is that… Basira? He – He’s got Basira with him!

ANNABELLE
Yes.

I did wonder if that would be the case.

Interesting.

And unfortunate for me. That’s two heads we’ll need to keep cool. My odds aren’t looking good.

MARTIN
Odds don’t matter if you’ve stacked the deck.

ANNABELLE
True. Now settle back. Try to look… intentional.

MARTIN
What does that mean?

ANNABELLE
They’re going to expect a suitably elaborate scene when they arrive, a monstrous tableau. I’d hate to disappoint them.

MARTIN
Right…

[MARTIN GINGERLY TRIES TO ADJUST HIS POSITION]

Hello, John. Basira.

ANNABELLE
Not just yet.

[MUFFLED ANXIETY]

[ANNABELLE HOISTS MARTIN UP]
ANNABELLE
[scolding] Ah. Ah. Ah!

[MUFFLED ANXIETY INCREASES TO MUFFLED TERROR]
You know better than I do if I could actually kill him, but we both know that if I drop Martin from here, he’s gone.

So, let’s all settle down.

[MUFFLED SADNESS]
BASIRA
What do you want?

ANNABELLE
To give you… all of you, a way out of this.

BASIRA
And you couldn’t just, I dunno, tell us?

ANNABELLE
I could, but I needed him to believe me. And for that, I needed him to feel this place, this opening beneath us.

ARCHIVIST
Put. Him. Down.

[MUFFLED DEMAND FOR RELEASE]
ANNABELLE
Very well.

[ANNABELLE LOWERS MARTIN GENTLY]
BASIRA
Martin, are you okay?

[MUFFLED MMHMM]
You know, we’d probably be more willing to listen if you hadn’t kidnapped our friend.

ANNABELLE
I didn’t. He came of his own free will.

[MUFFLED POINT OF CONTENTION]
ARCHIVIST
“Free will,” she says, as we stand in the middle of her fucking web!

ANNABELLE
[Laughs] A fair point. But that’s a debate for another time.

I simply mean I did not bring him here through force, threat or false pretence. I made an offer, and he agreed.

ARCHIVIST
Martin, is this true?

[MUFFLED ATTEMPTED EXPLANATION, FOLLOWED BY MUFFLED SIGH AND MUFFLED AGREEMENT]
BASIRA
Told you.

ARCHIVIST
We’ll talk about it later. Once you’re safe.

[MUFFLED DOWNBEAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT]
ANNABELLE
He’s perfectly safe right now. As long as everyone remains civil.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. Speak your piece. Tell us about your “way out”.

ANNABELLE
As you wish.

…

The Great Fears, do you believe they think the way we do?

ARCHIVIST
They don’t “think” at all. They just are.

ANNABELLE
Almost true. In truth, it depends on the Fear. Some exist in an eternal moment, some make use of memory to reflect and corrupt, but for most, time is simply another thing for them to play with. To consider the future, to plan, is not something they’re capable of.

ARCHIVIST
But not The Web?

ANNABELLE
No. Not the Mother-of-Puppets, the Spinner-of-Schemes.

BASIRA
Hang on. What about the rituals? Those were plans.

ARCHIVIST
No. They were… desires, filtered and interpreted by people, and the thinking creatures that they spawned.

ANNABELLE
You are well-informed, aren’t you? Exactly this. They hungered for the world, to step from the shadows, and gorge themselves on all humanity.

ARCHIVIST
And they have.

ANNABELLE
But only two of them could truly conceive of such. Terminus, The End, knows that in such a world they will ultimately consume themselves. And it desires that finality.

ARCHIVIST
[Realising] And The Web understands it as well. That eventually a successful ritual would doom them all. Leave them trapped and starving in a used up world with no-one to feed on.

BASIRA
Hang on, what? This is news to me.

ARCHIVIST
We passed a death domain, of The End. The victims there do actually die, meaning, even though it would take… I don’t know how long, eventually The End will claim everyone and everything. It’s inevitable.

BASIRA
Oh. [Exhales] Okay. Right. And what, the powers don’t realise?

ARCHIVIST
They don’t understand things like we do. But The Web is all about connections, unforeseen consequences. Of course, it realises.

ANNABELLE
Of course. And knowing this, knowing for centuries you would eventually be trapped, doomed to starvation, what would you do?

[LONG CONSIDERED PAUSE]
ARCHIVIST
Plan an escape.

ANNABELLE
Just so.

BASIRA
An escape? To where?

ARCHIVIST
Below us, Basira.

ANNABELLE
This is not ‘the’ world, it is ‘a’ world. And though it has taken so very long to prise it open, the gate to a thousand new realities now stands wide. However, despite this effort, the worlds beyond them remain so far unspoiled by the Fears’ touch.

ARCHIVIST
The Powers don’t exist there? They’re, what, unique to our… dimension?

ANNABELLE
Unique? Oh, I don’t know about that, but certainly there are many, many worlds without them.

BASIRA
Sorry, we’re talking about alternate dimensions now? Seriously?

ARCHIVIST
Really, Basira? Look around us! This is where you get sceptical?

BASIRA
Yeah.

[SUDDEN HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALS]
Okay, cut me some slack. This is a lot of new and weird information.

ARCHIVIST
So The Web, it wants to spread? To escape into new realities?

ANNABELLE
Yes, but not alone. Any attempt to separate the Fears is ultimately doomed, as you well know.

ARCHIVIST
But how?

ANNABELLE
We found the one we believed most likely to bring about their manifestation. We marked him young, guided his path as best we could. And then, we took his voice.

ARCHIVIST
No…

ANNABELLE
His, and those he walked with. We inscribed them on shining strands of word and meaning, and used them to weave a web which cast itself out through the gate and beyond our universe. So that when the Fears heard that voice, and came in their terrible glory, they might then travel out along it.

Or be dragged.

BASIRA
Is she talking about the tapes?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
So how is any of this a solution?

ARCHIVIST
Because for the Fears to spread into these new worlds, they would need to leave ours, wouldn’t they?

ANNABELLE
If one should leave this place for… greener pastures, the rest must follow.

ARCHIVIST
Leaving us behind in the process, freeing our world at the cost of others.

BASIRA
What are you saying?

ARCHIVIST
We can pass them our apocalypse.

[MUFFLED DISCOMFITED REALISATION]
ANNABELLE
Nothing so extreme. In these new worlds they would exist as they used to in ours, lurking just beyond the threshold.

ARCHIVIST
Until someone is stupid enough to release them there, as well.

ANNABELLE
Perhaps. Even the Mother cannot see the future. Only try to shape it.

ARCHIVIST
And so they spread through realities like a disease!

ANNABELLE
Perhaps.

ARCHIVIST
…

I won’t do it.

ANNABELLE
Possibly. You’ve seen your other options.

BASIRA
What happens to you if they escape? What happens to us? We’ve all been touched by them.

ANNABELLE
I would either travel with them, or I would die. I do not know which. My life is only sustained by The Web. Most would simply lose whatever power they have been gifted.

John would lose much of himself, the parts of him that are The Eye. But he would survive. And perhaps more importantly, he would remain who he believes himself to be. And you would end the suffering of all those others who remain here.

BASIRA
How would we do it?

ARCHIVIST
Basira!

BASIRA
We need to know, John.

ANNABELLE
It’s very simple.

Destroy the Archives, and cut out The Eye’s pupil.

BASIRA
[Sarcastic] Oh, is that all?

ANNABELLE
Simultaneously.

[MUFFLED DESPONDENCY]
ARCHIVIST
I see. Destroy the Panopticon, and you release its power. Kill Jonah, and you cut the connection between the Fears and the world. Do both at the same time, and… for just a moment, all that power rushes through their only remaining connection with reality: the tapes.

ANNABELLE
And they would be swept along them by it, dragged out of our realities, and into new ones…

BASIRA
And how exactly are we supposed to destroy the Archives?

ANNABELLE
Many years ago a draughtsman made an unfortunate and egregious error on certain city planning documents. As a result, an unusually large and dangerous gas main just happened to be constructed directly below the building you knew as the Magnus Institute, in a place where it would be protected by the tunnels of Robert Smirke, unchanged by the world’s reformation. You need only ignite it.

ARCHIVIST
Ignite it?

ANNABELLE
Indeed. And it just so happens that the perfect tool was once delivered to you as a token of appreciation. Though you really do need to learn to keep better care of it. Somehow it always seems to slip your mind, doesn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
What?

BASIRA
John, it’s that stupid lighter of yours.

ARCHIVIST
[Indignant] My what?

[THE ARCHIVIST PULLS THE GOLD LIGHTER WITH EMBOSSED SPIDERWEB FROM POCKET AND FLICKS IT OPEN]
Oh?

Oh.

ANNABELLE
A little anchor of our power, so that we, and our tapes, may follow wherever you go.

ARCHIVIST
I see.

So…

[FLICKS LIGHTER SHUT]
…if I were to throw it away –

[ANNABELLE GASPS]
– into your little pit…

[MUFFLED WORRY]
ANNABELLE
[Carefully] I would advise against that.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, would you?

BASIRA
John, she still has Martin.

[MUFFLED REMINDER]
[TENSE STAND-OFF]
ARCHIVIST
Fine!

Fine.

That’s it, then? Everything you wanted to tell us?

ANNABELLE
It is.

ARCHIVIST
Then we’re done here. Give us Martin.

ANNABELLE
As you wish.

[ANNABELLE RIPS MARTIN FREE FROM HIS STICKY RESTRAINTS]
[MARTIN STAGGERS TO HIS FRIENDS, COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING]
MARTIN
John!

ARCHIVIST
Martin!

[FABRIC RUSTLES]
MARTIN
Oh god, I’m sorry, I –

ARCHIVIST
It’s fine.

MARTIN
– didn’t realise that –

ARCHIVIST
We’ll talk later.

BASIRA
What about her?

ARCHIVIST
[Harsh] Good question. As far as I can tell there’s now nothing to stop me killing you. And throwing this lighter away forever.

ANNABELLE
Nothing, except your own indecision.

I’ve played my part to its completion. You get to decide how I exit the stage.

MARTIN
John?

ARCHIVIST
Go!

ANNABELLE
Very well. We shall not see each other again, Archivist. But I eagerly await your decision.

[ANNABELLE WITHDRAWS, SCUTTLING UP AND AWAY ACROSS THE WEBBED CHASM, STATIC AND HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALING IN HER WAKE]
MARTIN
So… what do we do now?

ARCHIVIST
Let’s get out of here. After that… we’ll see.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL ACCOMPANIED BY SWIRLING WINDS]
MARTIN
So… are we going to talk about it, or…?

ARCHIVIST
When we get back to London. I don’t – I think we all need some time to think.

MARTIN
…

Sure.

[FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE FOR A LONG WHILE WITH THE OCCASIONAL SIGH]
I-I mean it’s a pretty long walk. We could talk about something else.

BASIRA
Like why you wandered off with Annabelle Cane?

ARCHIVIST
Basira…

BASIRA
It’s important.

ARCHIVIST
He can tell us when he’s ready.

MARTIN
Uh, it’s fine. It’s not exactly a big surprise or anything.

Back in London, after we… uh…

ARCHIVIST
Had a blazing row?

MARTIN
I, uh… Yeah, that.

BASIRA
What?

ARCHIVIST
About what we should do with Jonah. With the Panopticon.

BASIRA
How, about whether you should, uh…?

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

MARTIN
Well, anyway, after that, I was coming out to look for you. But the tunnels are just all over the place, and you must have used a different way up or something, and well… she was there.

ARCHIVIST
Waiting?

MARTIN
I guess? It was so quiet. And it looked like London did before. So then I figured that she must have had the camera, which meant Salesa was probably dead, and so… well…

BASIRA
So…?

MARTIN
So I figured she had come to kill you, John.

ARCHIVIST
Me?

W-What about you?

MARTIN
What about me? I didn’t really think I was important enough to kill.

[SURPRISED EXHALES]
BASIRA
Wow, Martin, that’s –

MARTIN
Shocker, I have self-esteem issues, not the point. Anyway, she said she knew what you were planning to do, what would happen to you in there and… and then she said she knew another way, one where you’d be okay, but she couldn’t tell me, she had to show me.

BASIRA
And you took her at her word?

MARTIN
Obviously not, but… if she was telling the truth, it seemed worth the gamble.

ARCHIVIST
Why didn’t you come get me?

MARTIN
Because she said if I did, she’d leave without me. And then… well… we’d have had to stick with crappy Plan A, and you’d… you’d end up gone.

…

Okay, look, I-I admit it wasn’t great judgement, okay? But I didn’t see another choice. I figured you were safe enough with the girls, and, well…

ARCHIVIST
You were angry.

MARTIN
Yeah.

BASIRA
Right.

MARTIN
And… if I could give you another way out, it had to be worth the danger.

Even if it was kinda –

BASIRA
Reckless?

MARTIN
– a long shot.

BASIRA
Hmm.

MARTIN
[Nervous chuckles] Plus I knew you’d follow me, and save me if things got bad.

[ARCHIVIST SIGHS]
Look, I’m, I’m sorry I worried you.

ARCHIVIST
It’s okay.

MARTIN
But, it does look like I was right.

BASIRA
If she was actually on the level.

MARTIN
Well… yeah.

BASIRA
And if she was, she went about it in a really weird –

ARCHIVIST
Manipulative way.

BASIRA
Yeah. Big surprise. But she did kinda hold up her end.

ARCHIVIST
Huh.

MARTIN
I could’ve done without all the webbing, though. Still sticky. Urgh.

ARCHIVIST
Well, it’s over now. And you’re safe, that’s all that matters.

MARTIN
Not quite…

BASIRA
Mmhmm. We do have another option to consider.

ARCHIVIST
When we get back. I want to hear what the others have to say about it.

MARTIN
Then we should get going.

…

Er, speaking of? Um… Where, exactly, do we go now?

ARCHIVIST
Forward.

MARTIN
Uh, th-that’s a cliff, John.

ARCHIVIST
[Sighs] Over there.

BASIRA
Oh great.

MARTIN
W– S-Ser-Seriously? What happened to the big lake or whatever Basira was talking about? I was looking forward to the lake! I-I’m fine rowing. I’m good at rowing!

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry. Some routes are one-way.

MARTIN
[Mildly distressed] So, so what, this is our new path then? Some rickety ladder on a cliff edge that’s so high you can’t even see the bottom? Really?

ARCHIVIST
I’ll admit it’s not a subtle metaphor.

[BASIRA CHUCKLES]
MARTIN
[Sullen] Yeah I get it. I don’t need another lesson on nightmare geography. It was obvious as soon as I said it out loud.

ARCHIVIST
If there was another way…

MARTIN
Yeah, but there never is. Urgh, fine. Come on.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[FOOTSTEPS ON METAL AS THEY DESCEND THE LADDER, THE WIND SWIRLING LOUDLY AROUND THEM]
MARTIN
[To himself] Okay… Easy does it.

One at a time. One at a time.

BASIRA
Careful of your next one, Martin! It’s loose.

MARTIN
Hmm.

Right! Thank you!

Brilliant.

[CAREFUL FOOTSTEP, THEN METAL CREAKS AND GIVES WAY WITH A CLATTER AND SHOWER OF PEBBLES]
[MARTIN EXCLAIMS IN SHOCK AS HE REGAINS HIS FOOTING]
ARCHIVIST
Martin! Martin, are you alright?

MARTIN
[Mildly panicked] Mmmhmm!

BASIRA
[Gentle] I did warn you.

MARTIN
Mmmhmm!

BASIRA
Are you good to keep going?

MARTIN
Yeah, just… just… Yeah.

[METALLIC SOUNDS AS DESCENT CONTINUES]
ARCHIVIST
Martin, would it help to know that if you do fall, you’ll be okay?

MARTIN
[Suspicious] Define “okay”.

ARCHIVIST
I, uh – You wouldn’t die.

MARTIN
Yeah, but it would still hurt, wouldn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
Uh, yes.

But not as much as th–

MARTIN
And, crucially, it would still feel like I’m falling an incredible distance. Wouldn’t it?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, you would still be falling an incredible distance.

You just wouldn’t die when you hit the bottom.

MARTIN
Yeah, and there it is.

BASIRA
Oh, I have missed your pep-talks.

ARCHIVIST
I’m afraid it’s the best I can manage.

MARTIN
Yeah, well, thanks for trying.

BASIRA
Can we just keep going?

ARCHIVIST
Right.

[LADDER DESCENDING CONTINUES FOR A WHILE, THEN…]
Ah.

BASIRA
What?

ARCHIVIST
Right.

BASIRA
“Right”, what?

MARTIN
Guys, what’s going on down there?

ARCHIVIST
The, uh… The ladder ends.

MARTIN
What do you mean it ends?

BASIRA
I’m guessing you’re not talking about the ground.

ARCHIVIST
No. No ground. And… no more ladder.

MARTIN
So what do we do?

BASIRA
What do you think? We jump. And we fall.

[MARTINS CHUCKLES IN DISBELIEF]
MARTIN
What?! No! No, no. I’m not, I’m not doing that. This is, this is obviously like a wrong turn or something.

BASIRA
It’s a ladder, Martin.

MARTIN
Yeah, I know, Basira, but somehow we’ve still managed it!

BASIRA
You said it won’t kill us, right?

ARCHIVIST
Right. We’ll just need to try and –

MARTIN
[Babbling to self] Jesus… Seriously? Hah! If, if all your friends jumped off a cliff would you join them? No! No, I wouldn’t! cos it’s stupid!

BASIRA
[Sharp enough to snap Martin out of it] Martin! Enough!

ARCHIVIST
We just want to make sure we separate out so we don’t hit each other on the way down, or – Oh! Ah.

MARTIN
Oh, Christ, what now?

ARCHIVIST
Sorry, I, uh… hah.

MARTIN
Are you serious?!

BASIRA
You couldn’t have made a statement before we got on the ladder?

ARCHIVIST
That’s not how it works!

MARTIN
Oh c–

BASIRA
Fine. I’m out, then. You coming Martin?

[THE LADDER CREAKS PARTICULARLY OMINOUSLY IN THE WIND]
MARTIN
Oh… S-So my choices are jump off a cliff, or cling to it while John does a statement?

BASIRA
And then jump off it. Yeah.

MARTIN
[Distressed] For fuck’s sake…

Fine.

BASIRA
Okay.

MARTIN
Mmhmm.

BASIRA
On three.

One…

[METALLIC CREAK AS MARTIN LEAPS WITH A GRIMACE AND A SHOUT THAT IS SOON SWALLOWED BY THE WIND]
[Sighs] Or just go then, I guess.

[SOUNDS OF LADDER CLIMBING, LOTS OF HEAVY BREATHING AND OMINOUSLY CREAKING METAL, LOOSE ROCK DUST AND HEAVY WINDS]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Down

And down

And down again

Rung after rung after rung to run down a long forever way to nowhere

A simple path, a line that was defined before we first stepped off the edge

We beg to find another way but all around despair is only empty, hollow air

Don’t look down.

Don’t see how far it is to fall.

And still we do not know what lurks so far below and waits upon the ground

The only sound the howling gale that tries to break us and the tinny click and clack of rusted rungs begun so far above

Or below.

Which way we move is but a distant glimpse of what might once be hope

But now is only only vertigo

As metal creaks and screams the beams of this iron thin and dying skeleton we hold to spite the sky

We don’t want to die

But what else is there to do but climb

Don’t look down

Don’t look up

The rung above is smooth and white and cool as aged bone

Slick and brittle as the future

Dead and silent as the past

The rung below is eaten through with rust

And creaks and snaps to amber dust when we try to place a foot upon it

[A RUNG BREAKS, SENDING METAL AND STONES FALLING]
Fall away, rotten thing

And leave us to grip with stiff and frozen fingers as we try to linger here and

Not look down

Not follow in your path

Not surrender to the air

[SCREECHING STARTS, FAINT THEN DRAWING NEARER]
There is another noise

A screeching cry from out the sky and lost as fast within its wide embrace

It is a body, no, a pair, a dozen panicked flailing shapes their mouths agape

With all the terror that we keep within our heart and try to swallow

As the void that claims these souls will swallow them

[SCREECHES TURN TO DISCORDANT SHRIEKS AND THEN TO SCREAMS]
It’s raining

Cadavers that do not know they’re dead

Or do they

For from their ragged throats they seem to have no doubt as to their fate

They shout and plead and bargain for gravity to wait and give another chance to hold the ladder close

Then they are gone

Abandoned by all but the indifferent pull

Of the waiting ground below

But they fall slow enough that maybe we may see within their faces

Us

In feature or in name there’s no reflection but the dreadful pained inflection of their fall

We see our end

And when they pass so fast it seems perhaps they were not there at all

We pause and sweat and shake and swear

It will not be us

And we don’t look down

The wind returns to shake the rails to which we bind our path and bids us to continue but

Something has changed

We reach up with a shaking hand

No

We reach down with a nervous foot

No

And all within an instant comes the gut-felt blow that we no longer know which way we were directed

A moment comes to mind from tinted memory of finding that the sole escape for us was down

Beyond the crumbled precipice to descend upon this shaking metal thing

And find a solid earth below it where we might be free

And yet there is another other coloured but no less in focused clarity or recall

Of a muddy foetid swamp that clings in cloying clumping damp

And tried to pull us to itself and claim our last breaths within its awful depths

So in the dread of our extremity we grasp the slick and filthy rungs

To pull us up and out

But now the air is all we see and there may be no cliff or swamp to flee

Or imagine as salvation from this ladder that is all we know exists

All else is empty

And so we wait

Our breath held close within our chest

As we wait for a sign of what’s to come

Where we might go

We look up at last

And see its twisting stretch that pulls away in all infinity to nothing

And we retch to think of all that way to climb to find nothing but a waving orphaned tip

Surmounting all our fears

We look down at last

And the space below us is not endless

But far worse the ground is there so bleak and bare and hard and waiting hungry for our fall

How many miles we cannot count for as we try to think about such measurements

It seems to move away

Any yet such distance does not dim its need to feed upon our shattered broken form

And so we cling

Desperate

Unmoving

Holding out with all our might against the smouldering fire of that awful dark desire to surrender

To the open arms of empty air

As the bodies start to fall around us once again

[STATIC RISES AND THEN FADES]
ARCHIVIST
Right. Well. I guess that’s it, then.

MARTIN
I resent that.

[COUGHING SOUNDS]
ARCHIVIST
[Wincing] There is a big difference between knowing pain and experiencing it.

MARTIN
Don’t worry, it passes pretty quickly.

ARCHIVIST
I know.

MARTIN
Of course you do.

ARCHIVIST
But it hasn’t passed yet.

MARTIN
Nope.

BASIRA
Alright, let’s get you up.

[ARCHIVIST IS ASSISTED UP WITH SOME PAINED EXCLAMATIONS]
ARCHIVIST
Okay. I’m okay.

BASIRA
Martin says that’s London up ahead.

ARCHIVIST
Yes.

BASIRA
Looks even more messed up than usual.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah. We, uh, we should be okay, but best be careful.

MARTIN
Yeah keep an eye out.

BASIRA
Was that a joke, or…?

ARCHIVIST
Come on. Let’s get home.

Georgie? Melanie?

[Muffled] In here.

[STEPS AS THEY MOVE INTO THE INDICATED ROOM]
MARTIN
Hey, what happened here? Are you both okay? Where is everybody?

GEORGIE
[Upset] They came for them. Took them away. Like before.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, god.

MARTIN
Who’s ‘they’?

GEORGIE
The… things from the city. You know, the, the ones that serve that big eye.

ARCHIVIST
Because of me?

MELANIE
Probably.

GEORGIE
W– It doesn’t matter. [Sighs] It’s the same as last time. We thought maybe keeping our numbers down might help, but… No, it was always borrowed time.

MELANIE
W-We tried to stop them, but –

GEORGIE
There, there were just too many. We… we couldn’t do anything. Just had to listen as they were dragged off.

MARTIN
I’m so sorry.

BASIRA
Damn.

MELANIE
Ha-Hang on? Basira, is that you?

BASIRA
Heya, Melanie. How, uh, how are you?

MELANIE
I’m fi– I mean… fine compared to – You know. Anyway, come here.

[MELANIE AND BASIRA HUG]
Where’ve you been?

BASIRA
Just wandering. I’ll tell you about it later.

GEORGIE
You got Martin back, then?

ARCHIVIST
We did.

MARTIN
I was actually doing alright until you showed up, and then Annabelle started acting up for company.

BASIRA
At which point we rescued you from certain death.

MARTIN
[Grumbling] Well, hardly certain death.

GEORGIE
Well, it’s good to see you in one piece. I assume the spider-woman is, um…?

ARCHIVIST
Actually, no, it’s a bit more complicated than that.

MELANIE
No, I’ll have a real answer, thanks.

MARTIN
Annabelle wasn’t trying to kill anyone. She just wanted to offer us a choice. Sort of, tell us about another option, I guess.

GEORGIE
That sounds… ominous.

MARTIN
Hmmm.

BASIRA
It is.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

You got anything to drink in those supplies of yours? I think I could really do with one.

[RATTLE OF GLASS]
We need to talk. All of us.

[CLICK]
[CLICK]
[ALL VOICES IN THIS EPISODE HAVE TUNNEL OR TOWER ECHO IN SOME FORM]
MELANIE
So…

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE]
MARTIN
Anyone want another cup of tea?

[SOMETHING WOODEN SCRAPES ACROSS TUNNEL FLOOR]
Well, heh, I say ‘tea’, it’s har–

GEORGIE
We can’t keep putting it off. We need to talk about this. About what we’re going to do.

MARTIN
You mean what John’s going to do.

BASIRA
No. If we’re doing this, it’s gonna take all of us.

MELANIE
You say “If”? It’s basically our only option, right?

ARCHIVIST
No, it’s not.

MELANIE
So, we’re seriously holding up ‘let John become god’ as a legitimate choice here?

BASIRA
We can’t just dismiss it.

[EXASPERATED EXHALES]
MARTIN
Yes, we can.

MELANIE
Seconded!

MARTIN
[Pleased] Thank you.

GEORGIE
We still have to discuss it.

Let’s try to lay this out properly. What are our actual options here? As far as I can see there are three.

MELANIE
Okay.

GEORGIE
One. We follow Annabelle’s plan. We destroy the Panopticon, kill Elias –

ARCHIVIST
Jonah –

GEORGIE
Whatever.

ARCHIVIST
– Magnus.

GEORGIE
We kill him, and release the Fears into… how many other realities?

BASIRA
She said thousands, but I don’t think she actually knows.

GEORGIE
John?

ARCHIVIST
Not something I can see, I’m afraid.

GEORGIE
But is it all other realities, or just some of them?

ARCHIVIST
Does it matter?

MARTIN
I mean, maybe? If there are infinite worlds out there then “thousands” isn’t even a drop in the bucket, cosmically speaking.

MELANIE
“Cosmically speaking”?

MARTIN
You know what I mean.

[MELANIE SIGHS]
BASIRA
It’s still more than one, though, isn’t it? Which is what we’re discussing.

GEORGIE
So again, option one is to kill Jonah Magnus –

MELANIE
Mmhmm.

GEORGIE
– and release the Fears. Save the world, but doom other realities to the Fears.

MELANIE
We don’t know they’ll be doomed.

GEORGIE
Spread the fears to other realities.

Option two is John takes over from Magnus. Keeps the Powers contained here with us, and tries his best to make the place a little more… tolerable, until the end.

MARTIN
And we lose him.

ARCHIVIST
Martin…

MARTIN
No, John, I’m sorry, but if one world still matters in an infinite spread of dimensions, then one person does, too.

MELANIE
I-I think the issue is he matters a bit too much.

MARTIN
The point is you don’t have a responsibility to sacrifice yourself just to make everyone else’s lives a bit easier.

ARCHIVIST
I’ve already made them a hell of a lot harder!

MELANIE
Hmmm.

MARTIN
[Sharply] Then we should all sacrifice ourselves, because everyone in this room has some responsibility for it.

MELANIE
Hey! Georgie didn’t do anything!

GEORGIE
No, Melanie, I, I didn’t.

MELANIE
[Softly] Yeah.

GEORGIE
And maybe I should have. I kept out of it, even when I got a pretty good idea of what was going on towards the end. But… I should have known better. Hiding never helps.

MELANIE
It keeps you alive.

GEORGIE
For a while! But… we couldn’t actually do anything, could we? Couldn’t save anyone.

BASIRA
Okay, fine, blame for everyone. But the hard fact is, John’s the only one who can take over the Panopticon.

MARTIN
Would you stop just putting everything on him?

GEORGIE
Which brings us to our third option.

ARCHIVIST
Which is?

GEORGIE
Do nothing. We… adapt to the new world, and just wait for it to finally end.

ARCHIVIST
Leaving everyone to just suffer until the Powers burn out.

MARTIN
You said yourself that even if you did take over, you couldn’t stop the suffering. If we keep it all trapped here, it’s gonna be hell either way.

BASIRA
It’s alright for us though, isn’t it? We’re not the ones trapped in our worst nightmares.

MELANIE
What’s your point?

BASIRA
Do we actually have the right to make this decision? The five of us? For the whole world, or for maybe infinite worlds we know nothing about?

GEORGIE
No, of course we don’t. But we’re the ones here. And I doubt there’s anyone else out there who’s in a better position to decide.

ARCHIVIST
There isn’t.

GEORGIE
So, we’re the ones that have to make the call, and we need to acknowledge that doing nothing is still on the table as an option.

[LONG EXHALES]
BASIRA
We could ask them.

GEORGIE
Who?

BASIRA
The people trapped in the domains. The ones actually doing the suffering. Why don’t we see what they want?

ARCHIVIST
[Pained] Because I already know. They want it to stop.

But to try and explain it all to them, give them enough context for them to make an actual, meaningful choice… I don’t think it’s possible while they’re still trapped. They’re too much a part of their domains.

BASIRA
So we bring them out.

[To Melanie & Georgie] You’ve rescued people before; we can do it again.

GEORGIE
True…

MARTIN
S-Sure, but we can’t bring everyone out. So then, all we’re actually doing is deciding who makes the call with even less understanding than us.

MELANIE
Right? It’s kind of shitty to bring them out just to ask them if they’re willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.

MARTIN
Mmm.

BASIRA
Shittier than just making the decision for them?

MELANIE
If the decision is to do it, maybe they’d be grateful we saved them the guilt.

MARTIN
If it’s just a matter of guilt, then I’ll take it right now. I’d rather live the rest of my life lying awake wondering if I made the right choice, over lying awake listening to the screams of everyone on Earth being tortured!

ARCHIVIST
[Angry] What? So it’s better for a thousand times more people to scream as long as we can’t hear them?

MARTIN
No! Because Annabelle said it wouldn’t be like that. Wherever they go, it’ll be like it was here before, with the Powers just lurking on the edges.

MELANIE
And our world survived like that for… for what, all of history?

MARTIN
Mmmm.

MELANIE
Sure, it’s not great, but it’s, it’s not like those other realities won’t have bad stuff happening already. We all lived with monsters in the shadows, and we just got on with it.

BASIRA
Yeah, until we didn’t – until the ritual kicked off. What’s to stop the same thing happening in these other worlds?

MARTIN
It, it took like millennia of failed rituals before this happened. That means there has to be a chance that it won’t happen at all, right?

GEORGIE
Maybe.

MELANIE
And if it does happen, it will be because of the actions of the people in those other dimensions, just like here it was because of –

ARCHIVIST
Me.

MELANIE
Because of us.

…

My point is, we can’t take responsibility for the hypothetical actions of hypothetical people in all these other universes.

Fundamentally, the Fears travelling to these other places isn’t a death sentence. And even if the worst happens, they might just find themselves in exactly the same situation as us, deciding whether to pass it all along again.

MARTIN
Like the worst chain letter ever.

MELANIE
Exactly. Probably have their own Panopticon, their own Archivists.

MARTIN
[Shudders] Their own Martin.

MELANIE
If they’re unlucky. Heh.

MARTIN
Oh, ha, ha.

ARCHIVIST
But the point is, we have a chance to stop all that. We, we don’t have to post the letter. We can keep them contained, a-and even eventually destroy them.

GEORGIE
Can we?

MARTIN
What do you mean?

GEORGIE
Well… Did Annabelle say for certain that this dimension is where they were, um, ‘born’, I guess?

ARCHIVIST
No. No, the Eye can’t see its own creation, so… I don’t actually know how they came to be. Perhaps we can’t know.

GEORGIE
So, how can we be sure they didn’t come through to our reality in exactly this way? Maybe we’re just another link in a long chain of these things spreading from one dimension to the other, growing at the edges, manifesting, and then escaping to somewhere new.

MARTIN
Like weeds.

BASIRA
Or a fungus.

ARCHIVIST
Sure, but even if that was true, it doesn’t change the situation.

BASIRA
Yes, it does. If it’s a choice between stopping the Fears completely – destroying them once and for all, here and now – or just being one universe they don’t escape, among potentially infinite ones where they do… Those are very different scenarios.

They are to me, at least.

ARCHIVIST
We don’t know. And even if we hunted Annabelle down, and squeezed more information out of her, I don’t think she knows either. We simply don’t have that information, and we can’t just arbitrarily decide what’s true just because it makes the choice easier for us.

MARTIN
And you can’t just arbitrarily decide it isn’t because you want a better reason to martyr yourself!

ARCHIVIST
That’s not what’s happening!

MARTIN
Isn’t it?

MELANIE
Either way, it’s not an unreasonable conclusion. It’s just as likely as this dimension being where they were born. I-It’s more likely, even, which means we’d be condemning everyone for no reason.

ARCHIVIST
Hardly “no reason”. And let’s be honest for a second, you just want an excuse to stick a knife in Jonah Magnus.

GEORGIE
John!

MELANIE
No, he’s got a point. I want that smug bastard dead, and if I got a chance to do it myself, you can bet I would do it in a heartbeat. But if you think that’s all I care about here, then frankly you can fuck off out my tunnels on your high horse.

[TENSE PAUSE]
MARTIN
I, I can’t just hang around, and watch the whole world linger like this on the off-chance that it might do some small good somewhere else.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe it doesn’t have to linger.

BASIRA
You want to think very hard about your next words.

ARCHIVIST
I’m just saying… If I took my place in the Panopticon, I’d hoped I could make it easier for everyone, but… maybe I could just make it faster. Shuffle people towards The End. Accelerate things.

[GEORGIE SHIVERS]
GEORGIE
Would The Eye even let you do that?

ARCHIVIST
It’s like Annabelle said, it doesn’t really do foresight. As long as it was fed, I doubt it would even know until it was too late. And The Web couldn’t touch me once I was in control.

GEORGIE
John, you’re talking about killing the whole world…

ARCHIVIST
You’re the one who wanted to cover every option. We need to admit that ending it quickly might be a kindness.

The truth is, any choice we make is going to lead to an atrocity of one sort or another. At least this way we know the suffering ends.

BASIRA
No. No, I’m not just gonna stand here, and watch you try to justify murdering humanity.

ARCHIVIST
[Angry] How is it different from just letting it happen on its own?

BASIRA
[Forceful] Because it is. It’s not an option. End of discussion.

ARCHIVIST
Basira –

MARTIN
Uh, I just can’t accept it’s really that hopeless. There’s got to be a chance that these other universes will figure something out that we didn’t.

MELANIE
They’ll have as much of a chance as we did. More, maybe. The Fears had a long time to get a foothold in our world.

ARCHIVIST
Assuming time even works the same in different dimensions.

[MELANIE SIGHS]
GEORGIE
We’ve got to hope.

ARCHIVIST
Hope that our actions don’t destroy countless other worlds!

GEORGIE
It’s better than the certainty that they’ll destroy this one!

[TENSE SILENCE]
ARCHIVIST
Sounds like you’ve all decided, then.

BASIRA
Seems that way.

GEORGIE
Shall we vote on it, or something?

ARCHIVIST
[A touch miffed] No need. Seems pretty much unanimous at this point. We take out the Panopticon, and just hope for the best.

MARTIN
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Fine. I’m going for a cigarette.

[FAINT CHUCKLE FROM GEORGIE]
Besides, I can’t really think down there.

[DRAG ON CIGARETTE]
That’s not true, I can. It’s just… exhausting. Puts me in a foul mood.

It’s better up here, close to The Eye. Thoughts come quicker.

GEORGIE
If it’s any consolation, you seemed pretty on the ball earlier.

ARCHIVIST
It isn’t, really, but… thank you.

GEORGIE
Can I have a cigarette?

[ARCHIVIST SMIRKS BEFORE PASSING ONE OVER]
ARCHIVIST
Hmm. Sure. I thought you quit?

GEORGIE
I did, for my health. But it’s already the apocalypse, so… I’ll need a light too.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

[LIGHTER SNICKS OPEN]
[GEORGIE LIGHTS UP]
GEORGIE
I tried to avoid it in the tunnels when we had our, uh… When the others were here.

Nice lighter.

ARCHIVIST
Hmm?

[FAINT STATIC RISES AND FALLS]
You didn’t want to tarnish the image of the prophets?

GEORGIE
Just didn’t think they wanted one of their revered leaders puffing away in the corner.

[THE ARCHIVIST MURMURS AN ASSENT]
Saw a bishop smoking once when I was a kid, full Easter regalia and all. Really weirded me out.

ARCHIVIST
[Soft chuckles] I should probably quit myself, then.

[LIGHT METALLIC SOUND]
GEORGIE
Then you won’t mind if I hang onto this?

ARCHIVIST
[Distracted] Hmm.

[FAINT STATIC RISES AND FALLS]
GEORGIE
I’m sorry. I know you hate what we’re doing.

ARCHIVIST
I hate all the options. I just… It’s all my fault, you know?

GEORGIE
What, because you weren’t able to outsmart the literal embodiment of manipulation and scheming?

ARCHIVIST
Mmm.

GEORGIE
We all make bad choices, John. It’s not your fault some eldritch horror decided yours were going to affect the whole world.

ARCHIVIST
They were still my choices.

GEORGIE
Yeah. And you live with them. Or you don’t. That’s all there is, really.

ARCHIVIST
Hmm.

[SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BELOW]
GEORGIE
Anyway, looks like your next appointment’s here.

Thanks for the smoke.

[GEORGIE STANDS TO LEAVE]
ARCHIVIST
Georgie…

GEORGIE
Yeah?

ARCHIVIST
I, um…

…

[FAINT FOOTSTEPS CLIMBING THE STAIRS]
I’m glad you and Melanie have each other through all this.

GEORGIE
Thanks.

And I’m glad you’ve got him.

[FOOTSTEPS GET CLEARER]
GEORGIE
He’s all yours.

MARTIN
Thanks.

[GEORGIE’S FOOTSTEPS DESCEND AND FADE]
You alright?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

Sorry it got so heated in there.

MARTIN
Don’t be. I’d have been more worried if you were super calm about it.

ARCHIVIST
Yeah.

MARTIN
I’d understand if you hate me right now.

ARCHIVIST
What? No! No, Martin, I love you. I always will. And I know you love me too. I mean… [sighs] that’s it, isn’t it? That’s the real core of it. You want to save me.

MARTIN
I want you to save yourself.

[LONG DRAG OF CIGARETTE]
ARCHIVIST
Sometimes… I imagine if none of this had happened. If we had just… met. Been together, without… all of this.

MARTIN
[Softly] Me, too.

…

But we wouldn’t have, would we? Been together, I mean.

ARCHIVIST
Huh? W-What do you mean?

MARTIN
Well, we had that, didn’t we? Almost a year of just working a normal job together, and you hated me.

ARCHIVIST
I didn’t ‘hate’ you.

MARTIN
No, no, no, no. I listened to those tapes. At one point you explicitly said you’d be fine with me being chopped up by that old jigsaw lady.

ARCHIVIST
Oh god, Angela! Ha! She’s still about, you know? Lording it over a nasty little Flesh domain.

Anyway, I didn’t explicitly say it. I… implied it.

MARTIN
Face it, John, it took almost two years of crisis and trauma to even make us compatible. And that sucks. But here we are.

And I don’t want it to be for nothing. I won’t let it.

ARCHIVIST
That’s very sweet of you, Martin.

Sort of.

Thank you.

MARTIN
Wherever you go, I go. That’s it.

ARCHIVIST
You promised to let me go. If I had to.

MARTIN
And you promised not to go if there was any other choice.

And there is. So that’s the deal.

ARCHIVIST
That’s the deal.

MARTIN
I guess that’s why it really bothers me, you know? I try, but I can’t actually imagine ever making a decision that I knew meant losing you.

And it… It hurts to know you can.

ARCHIVIST
You didn’t damn the world, Martin.

MARTIN
We all –

ARCHIVIST
[Harsh] No! “We all” nothing!

I, I’m the one who caused all of this, that’s just the truth of it! I’m the one whose whole life has been nothing but one long setup to this.

MARTIN
John…

ARCHIVIST
[With sadness] You didn’t speak the words! You didn’t feel them move through you, vomiting out of you like…

…

I did this. It’s my fault. And I don’t want… I can’t let anyone else feel that. That helpless, enormous guilt.

Ever.

[ARCHIVIST SNIFFS AS IF TEARING UP]
MARTIN
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here, come here.

[FABRIC RUSTLES, WITH SNIFFS FROM THE ARCHIVIST]
We’re going to fix it.

No.

We’re just going to pass it on.

[DOOR CREAKS, FOOTSTEPS ENTER]
ARCHIVIST
There you are. I was getting worried.

MELANIE
We were scouting. I was showing Basira where we think the gas mainline is.

MARTIN
And?

BASIRA
Not good. You know those eye things?

ARCHIVIST
The old Archivists?

BASIRA
Yeah. I think they know something’s up. The place is crawling with them. It’s like they’re looking for something.

MELANIE
Or patrolling.

MARTIN
Hmm.

GEORGIE
That’s why the stairs were unguarded?

BASIRA
It looks that way.

MELANIE
Mmm.

ARCHIVIST
So what’s the plan?

MELANIE
I reckon me and Georgie go for the mainline, and hopefully they won’t notice us.

GEORGIE
I’ll need a torch. They might notice that.

BASIRA
I’ll give a diversion; I’ll try and draw them off.

MELANIE
And if they see Georgie’s torch, we just go to Plan B. She becomes another distraction, and I go solo.

GEORGIE
I don’t like the thought of you going on your own.

MELANIE
And I don’t like the thought of you being chased by manky old archivists, but there it is.

MARTIN
Okay. So what are you going to do when you find it?

GEORGIE
We’ve got some old tools. I guess we just mess with it until we smell gas, and then back off, set something burning and leg it. It can’t be that hard to break a valve.

MELANIE
John, you’re sure about this whole gas main thing? It just seems, I don’t know, really mundane.

ARCHIVIST
It’s what Annabelle said, and she wasn’t lying. At least, she didn’t think she was.

BASIRA
Well, it’s a bit late for second-guessing.

MARTIN
How… How big is the explosion going to be?

GEORGIE
Big enough. Honestly, I’m kind of hoping there’s some sort of supernatural reason it will channel up into the tower, otherwise, uh… it’s going to be bad news down here.

MARTIN
Don’t get yourselves hurt.

GEORGIE
Well, we’ll do what we can, but this is it. Whatever it takes, right? If there’s a price, we pay it. No hesitations.

MELANIE
And it’s hardly going to be a picnic for you, either. You’re going up that tower to kill Elias, and if we muck up the timing, you’ll be up there when it blows.

MARTIN
John can’t do it.

ARCHIVIST
What?

MELANIE
Sure he can, just magic-laser-eye zap him or whatever, same as with all the others. Like he did to Helen.

ARCHIVIST
Listen, Melanie –

MELANIE
It’s fine. If we all get out of this, we can talk it through. And if not, well, it doesn’t really matter, does it?

ARCHIVIST
I suppose not.

MARTIN
You’re not listening. I mean, if he kills Jonah, then knowing our luck he’s just going to end up taking his place in the Panopticon, isn’t he?

GEORGIE
[Sighs] Good point.

MARTIN
He can come up with me, but when it actually comes to Jonah…

BASIRA
You’ll have to be the one to do it.

MARTIN
Yeah.

ARCHIVIST
Martin… I don’t –

BASIRA
Have you got this? We can trade if you don’t think you can do it.

MARTIN
No. No, I can do it.

MELANIE
Make sure it hurts.

MARTIN
Oh, I will.

MELANIE
Good enough for me.

BASIRA
Me too.

GEORGIE
Okay. Sounds like we’ve got something like a plan.

[MARTIN’S SOUND OF ASSENT]
BASIRA
Makes a nice change.

[VARIOUS SOUNDS OF ASSENT]
MELANIE
[Brightly] It does, doesn’t it?

Uh… So. When do we actually do it?

GEORGIE
First thing tomorrow. That’ll give us time to prep and rest.

MARTIN
Sounds good to me.

MELANIE
Right.

[GENERAL MOVEMENTS AS THEY MAKE TO LEAVE]
BASIRA
Umm, hey, John? Can you hang on a sec?

ARCHIVIST
Yeah?

BASIRA
I just mean… um…

If we don’t make it out of this… I wanted to say thanks. For coming back for me. [sighs] What I did… Who I was… I – Thanks.

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry for all of this.

BASIRA
We’ve all got regrets. But we can’t undo what’s done. All we can do is try and do something worthwhile with the time we’ve got left.

I suppose I always knew that, deep down. But it was wonderful while it lasted. I’ve seen more than I could have lived in a thousand lifetimes, and every moment was so –

ARCHIVIST
Shut up!

It ends now. All of it. I am going to take this world that you used me to create, and I am going to burn it out. It’s the only way. I’m going to leave it a barren, lifeless void, cold and unafraid and then finally, when everyone’s gone, and I am all that’s left, I will have the satisfaction of knowing that I’ll be leaving these things that you serve trapped and starving in their own private hell.

[FOOTSTEPS FADE AS DOOR CLOSES]
[THE ARCHIVIST GASPS IN PAIN AS STATIC FLARES AGAIN]
[ANIMAL NOISES – CHIRPS, CROAKS AND CALLS]
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
Once upon a time there was fear. Old fear. Primal fear. A fear of blood and pounding feet, a fear of that sudden burst of pain and then nothing. And that fear was nothing. Went nowhere. Knew not what it was.

Then it became. Or perhaps it always was and simply entered. But fear was here and true and was itself, and it hungered. It wished to know more. It wished to feel more. It wished to be more. And to those things that hurried through the grass, that shivered through the night in their burrows and their caves, because they knew the dark held flashing talons and shining eyes, they fed the fear. It was blunt and it was simple, but still it was solid enough to satisfy. And the thing that was fear was sated and content.

Then came minds that knew it differently. They grew slowly, over the millennia; inch by inch they found new things to dread. The fear of their own end, of the things that lived in the darkness, became a fear of the darkness itself. And as they grew to know what it is that they saw, to give it names, and struggle at learning, so too did they learn to fear that their eyes might deceive them, or show them too much. And as they learned to know their friends and kin, so too did they learn to fear the unknown figure, the coming of the stranger, and the silence when they were alone. And when they found fire, that bright ignition of home and hope and progress, the thing that was fear gorged itself on a newfound terror once again.

[ROARING FLAME RUSHES THROUGH, FOLLOWED BY STORM SOUNDS]
And as these tiny, strange minds grew and learned, they did something new. They began to take their thoughts, their instincts and their horrors, and they crystallised them. They gave them sound and form and shape to share them. And as they did the thing that was fear felt itself began to tear, to crack and fracture along a thousand unseen fault lines. It bled and warped and multiplied, and could no longer see itself as once it did. It could never be whole again.

But within these forms were freedoms, new and wonderful dreads to push and explore, new muscles to flex. The joy of oozing, crawling pestilence as minds distrusted their own corrupted bodies. The satisfaction of surrounding them, suffocating them, reaching down into them and drinking in their panic as breath failed them.

And as they grew to learn their place within the world, the pathetic meagreness of their own existence, they could not spin a story rich or grand enough to fully hide their own awful insignificance, lost and alone in the terrible greatness of the universe. And by the time these minds had reached a point of intricacy to lie and scheme and puppet one other, they had also learned to conceive of war.

[DRUMBEATS POUND A SINISTER CALL]
And as the things that were fear hovered at the edge of the world, the flowing horror of these minds nourished them, swelling some and withering others, pushing and pulling the shattered, swirling mass of terror into ever newer and undiscovered forms.

[SOFT VOCAL SUSURRATIONS JOIN THE DRUMS]
And something else began to happen. Some minds did not simply recoil from them and feed them. Some seemed almost to call them, to court them, to hunger for them in return. Minds that saw the faces of the things that were fear, and were compelled as much as they were repulsed. Whether or not they knew what it was they did, they called out. And they were answered.

[DRUMS FADE LEAVING BEHIND THE CHITTERING MURMURS]
Time is different for fear, and it cannot be said exactly who was the first to open themselves and be filled with the power of terror. A hermit, huddled in a pitch black cave through winter, who emerged and brought the depth of night with him wherever he trod. A pestilent chieftain who found her breath sloughed from her body and rotted whatever it touched. A warrior driven from their village, who found their face as smooth and shifting as the sands of their home. Which came first does not matter, the unseen gap was bridged, and the thin veil between the world that was and the things that were fear had been torn, ever so slightly.

[VOICES ARE JOINED THEN SUPERCEDED BY GUTTURAL ROARS]
And with this tear, they grew stronger, bolder, pouring themselves into the world and creating monsters. Long things that wore you like a suit, smiling things that stripped you from your bones, unseen things that watched and watched and watched and never left you. And with each new creation, each new servant, the Fears reached further and fed the things that made them.

And with this newfound power came greed. The hunger for more, the unformed, unfocused, but impossibly huge desire to exist. To join the minds that gave them shape and purpose, and finally drink their fill ‘til they were one and the same. They had no concept of how, or when, or even why, but they needed it. They needed it.

[A CHORAL DRONE BEGINS]
And so the things that were fear began to sing, to draw ever more multitudes to them, to shape them and push them and beg them for freedom. For existence. But though they jostled and pushed and fought to emerge, they could not. For they could not conceive of what or where they were beyond the words and images the minds below could give them.

[FAINT BUZZING SOUNDS, AS THE ROARS FADE AWAY AND ARE REPLACED WITH AN ALMOST MECHANICAL CLACKING]
But there was one, the part that some would call the Spider, that had been given a gift beyond all its brethren. The minds that feared grew suspicious of their own schemes, of connections and consequences, and over time these suspicions became threads, then webs, then nerves that granted the Spider, the Mother-of-Puppets, the Hidden Machination, a mind of its own; to plot and plan and draw its own connections, its own conclusions. Wheels, within wheels within wheels… It would not, could not tell its other parts, for were they even able to understand such things, which they could not, to trust, to share in such a way ran counter to its very essence.

And so it drew its plan to escape not only this ephemeral cage of non-existence, but even the very reality into which they might break, and it chose its fool: The Great Eye, the most unwise of all the fragments, forever seeking and consuming knowledge that it could not comprehend. It played and twisted and through The Eye brought about a new world, a wide and unending vista of terror and agony, and the place from which it might spread, and spin another web far grander than anything conceived of in the minds that birthed it.

Finally, it would find its escape and with it… apotheosis.

[SOUNDS FADE AS STATIC RISES AND THEN ITSELF FADES]
[THE ARCHIVIST EXHALES DEEPLY]
ARCHIVIST
No. It won’t. It has only found its end.

[DOOR OPENS]
MARTIN
John?

[FOOTSTEPS RING ON MARBLE]
John!

ARCHIVIST
Martin, what are you doing here?

MARTIN
Oh thank god. Just, just, just stop what you’re about to do, okay? I know that you think that a–

…

What’s that?

ARCHIVIST
Elias… Jonah Magnus.

MARTIN
[Shocked] He’s – You didn’t – ?

ARCHIVIST
I’m sorry, Martin.

MARTIN
[Horrified & scared] You didn’t. N-No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No! This isn’t – You can’t –

ARCHIVIST
I did. I am.

MARTIN
Why?!

ARCHIVIST
You know why. I can’t let them out. I can’t! Not again.

MARTIN
Oh, what have you done, John!

ARCHIVIST
Go tell the others. It’s over.

MARTIN
N-No… you don’t understand!

ARCHIVIST
What?

MARTIN
I’m sorry, John. I’m, I’m so sorry… I, I saw you had gone and… and I knew that you-you couldn’t help yourself. You never could! I knew you’d lied to me, that you were going in alone…

ARCHIVIST
Martin? What did you do?

MARTIN
[Shaking] I told them to go early. To do it straight away and…. I’d keep you talking. Until they were done.

ARCHIVIST
[Calm] Oh, Martin.

MARTIN
I didn’t think you’d go through with it! Not without me! I can’t believe you’d do this! That you’d leave me like this! You swore to me! You swore to me, you bastard!

ARCHIVIST
Martin! I’m still here.

MARTIN
Are you!? How much of you is even left now?

ARCHIVIST
It’s still me, Martin. I’m still here.

MARTIN
How would you even know?

ARCHIVIST
…

I’m sorry Martin, I am, but it’s done. You can hate me, you can scream at me, but it won’t change anything. I had to do this. And you promised.

MARTIN
[Angry trembling] Don’t you dare say that. Don’t you dare!

[THE ARCHIVIST’S VOICE HAS TAKEN ON A SOFTLY RESONANT QUALITY AS STATIC STARTS TO CRACKLE FAINTLY]
ARCHIVIST
We can still be together, here. Until it’s over.

MARTIN
You’re not listening! You never listen! They are down there fighting those things, and lighting it right now!

ARCHIVIST
It’s fine, Martin, I’ll call off the servitors.

They can’t light it, they don’t have… they don’t…

[PATS CLOTHING]
Wait a –

Oh… Oh, no.

[STATIC WAVE BURSTS ACROSS SCENE, AND THE ARCHIVIST SQUEALS IN DISTORTED AGONY]
MARTIN
John!

ARCHIVIST
Martin, I – AH! AH!

MARTIN
John, we have to get out of here!

ARCHIVIST
[Gasping] I… I can’t. Martin, I’m part of this place.

[STATIC SCREECH AND HE WINCES AUDIBLY]
MARTIN
Goddamn it, John!

ARCHIVIST
[Enduring] Aaaaaaargh! I can… withstand it. I just need to hold… on…

[EXPLOSION RESOUNDS]
MARTIN
[Gritted teeth] Come on, John! Come on!

[THE ARCHIVIST’S VOICE DISTORTS AS BUILDING AND REALITY START CRACKING, WITH STATIC SCREECHING AND SQUEALING THROUGHOUT]
ARCHIVIST
[Struggling] No! I can feel the pull… The web, the tapes, it wants –

No! I won’t let it!

MARTIN
For god’s sake, John, move!

ARCHIVIST
I can’t!

Martin, get out of here!

What’s going to be left of me after this, you can’t see that.

MARTIN
No!

ARCHIVIST
I can’t protect you from this. Go!

MARTIN
I’m not leaving you trapped here killing the world while I watch!

ARCHIVIST
If you stay, you’ll die!

MARTIN
Then I’ll die!

ARCHIVIST
No!

[CRUMBLING STONE AND MARTIN CRIES OUT AS IF STRUCK BY SOMETHING, STARTS SOBBING]
ARCHIVIST
Martin, please! I can’t lose you. Not like this…

MARTIN
Tough! Okay? Where you go, I go!

ARCHIVIST
That’s the deal…

[PANOPTICON CONTINUES TO COLLAPSE AS A SHARP STATIC WHINE RINGS OUT]
Okay.

MARTIN
What?

ARCHIVIST
Do it! The knife’s just there. Let them go.

MARTIN
[Tearful] I’m not going to kill you!

ARCHIVIST
Cut the tether. Send them away.

Maybe we both die. Probably. But maybe not. Maybe, maybe everything works out, and we end up somewhere else.

MARTIN
Together?

ARCHIVIST
One way or another. Together.

[METALLIC CLINK]
MARTIN
I don’t think I can…

ARCHIVIST
It has to be you. The Eye won’t let me do it.

MARTIN
[Sobbing] Are you sure about this?

ARCHIVIST
No.

But I love you.

MARTIN
I love you too.

[KISS]
[MARTIN STABS DEEPLY; THERE IS A SINGLE GASP]
[PAINED SOB]
[DISTORTED SCREECH, WITH SOUND LIKE TAPE RAPIDLY UNSPOOLING AMIDST A RISING CRESCENDO OF STATIC]
[THEN… CLICK]
[LONG SILENCE]
[CLICK]
[SOUND OF SHIFTING RUBBLE AND DEBRIS; BIRDSONG CAN BE HEARD FAINTLY]
BASIRA
Huh.

[MORE SHIFTING RUBBLE]
Still works.

GEORGIE
[Calling] You found something?

BASIRA
Just one of the old tape recorders.

[FOOTSTEPS ON RUBBLE]
GEORGIE
God, tough little bastards, aren’t they?

BASIRA
Yup.

[MORE FOOTSTEPS OVER RUBBLE]
MELANIE
No luck?

GEORGIE
No. Still no sign of them.

BASIRA
No bodies, though. That’s a good sign, maybe?

GEORGIE
Maybe.

MELANIE
Huh.

[BIRDS TWEET, WHILE SOUNDS OF PEOPLE BUILDING OR CLEARING ARE HEARD IN BACKGROUND]
Maybe it’s time to accept that they’re gone.

BASIRA
Hm.

MELANIE
And, honestly, it’s probably for the best.

I mean, I just don’t think people would exactly be understanding. You remember what happened when they found Simon Fairchild?

GEORGIE
Yeah…

MELANIE
And he’s not just some powerless left-behind avatar, you know? We’re talking about ‘The Archivist’.

BASIRA
Yeah okay, you’ve made your point. [sigh] Would just be nice to know for sure.

GEORGIE
All we can do is hope.

BASIRA
I suppose.

[LONG PAUSE]
GEORGIE
We should go. It’ll be dark soon, and we still need batteries for the nightlights.

MELANIE
And I’m sure Rosie’s keen for us to take the Admiral back off her hands.

GEORGIE
She’s alright, he’s calmed down a lot.

MELANIE
Thank god for tinned tuna.

…

Come on.

BASIRA
What do you want me to do with this?

GEORGIE
Leave it. We’re done with tapes.

MELANIE
Want me to smash it?

BASIRA
I think… we can probably just turn it off.

MELANIE
Okay.

[FOOTSTEPS AS MELANIE AND GEORGIE WALK AWAY]
BASIRA
If anyone’s listening… Goodbye.

I’m sorry, and…

Good luck.
